      "title": "UK starts talks to join Asia-Pacific free trade pact",
      "text": "Britain is to start negotiations to join a free trade area which could grant businesses access to \"some of the biggest economies of the present and future\", the government has said.\nThe Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is made up of 11 nations, including Australia, Canada and Japan.\nMembership would reduce tariffs on exports such as cars and whisky.\nThe trade area covers a market of around 500 million people.\nNew Zealand, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam are also founder members of the trade agreement, which was established in 2018. The UK applied to join the bloc in January following Brexit.\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the trade area was the \"part of the world where Britain's greatest opportunities lie\".\nBeing granted membership would be a \"glittering post-Brexit prize that I want us to seize\", she said.\nMs Truss said membership would help \"farmers, makers and innovators sell to some of the biggest economies of the present and future, but without ceding control over our laws, borders or money\".\nHowever, there has already been a political backlash against the UK's recently agreed free trade deal with Australia. UK farmers say imports from Australia could undercut them on price and undermine welfare standards.\nThe UK is the first non-founding country to apply to join the CPTPP and would be its second biggest economy after Japan, if negotiations succeed.\nThe free trade agreement aims to reduce trade tariffs - a form of border tax - between member countries and includes a promise to eliminate or reduce 95% of charges on traded goods.\nIn return, countries must cooperate on regulations, such as food standards. However, these standards and regulations do not have to be identical, and member countries can strike their own trade deals.\nLiz Truss will start the (virtual) talks on Tuesday to join the 11-strong trans-Pacific trading club, and she'll do so from the very room where Winston Churchill oversaw the War effort. The aim is to showcase post-Brexit ambitions. \nBut it is more about strategy than scale. With deals already in place with eight of the CPTPP members, joining may add as little as 0.1% to the size of the UK economy, and it's not clear yet what the UK will have to concede to get the deal, nor how quickly it will happen.\nThe real boost will come if others sign up to this pact. So far, America under President Joe Biden hasn't expressed an interest to do so - nor, as the trade secretary admitted to me, has it set a date to resume talks on a UK-US bilateral deal, paused earlier this year. \nAs trading partners go, the US is twice as important to the UK as all the CPTPP nations put together.\nMeanwhile, some economists have flagged up that trade with the EU may have been dampened to the tune of several billions of pounds by the new trading arrangements with that bloc, with fresh food particularly hard hit. \nThe Department for International Trade (DFIT) said exports to countries in the Asia-Pacific bloc were set to increase by 65%, around \u00a337bn, between now and 2030.\n\"Joining would boost this growth and support British jobs. These benefits would increase over time, with the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea all having expressed interest in joining,\" a DFIT statement said. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales has given 84% of people eligible for Covid boosters a vaccination, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales.\nThe programme has slowed down since before Christmas, delivering 3,752 booster doses a day in the last week.\nAt its height, 50,524 doses were given out on 21 December.\nTwo-thirds of vaccines given out in the past weeks were boosters, while more than 13,000 second doses, mainly to 12 to 15-year-olds.\nPeople can receive a booster three months after receiving their second vaccine, so it means that 84% of those eligible for a booster vaccine have now been reached in Wales.\nThat figure on 27 January was also 84% in Scotland, 81% in England and 75% in Northern Ireland.\nTo reach the remaining eligible people, at the current rate, it would take just over three months.\nThe situation is complicated by those who catch Covid having to wait before they can receive a booster, with higher proportions of the 18 to 40 age group infected since Christmas.\nThe total is 1,875,473 boosters given out by 27 January.\nThese include more than 42% of 18 to 29-year-olds and more than half of those in their 30s.\nWe can see that by last Sunday, 68% of adults had received their booster jab.\nMonmouthshire (78.6%) had reached the most and Cardiff (61.7%) the fewest.\nWith the over-50s, Monmouthshire has reached more than 88% and Powys, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend and Caerphilly more than 87%. Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "tags": "Personal finance,Transport,Rail travel",
      "text": "New flexible tickets go on sale from Monday aimed at commuters in England who only travel to work two or three days a week.\nThe new tickets can be used for eight days in any month-long period.\nThe National Rail website will allow passengers to calculate savings and book the new tickets.\nIt is part of the government's planned shake-up of rail services, but is being introduced immediately to cater to the trend for more home-working.\nFrom 2023 a new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set rail timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure.\nThe flexible season tickets are being introduced separately, ahead of the structural changes, and can be used from 28 June.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new tickets would offer \"greater freedom and choice about how we travel, simpler ticketing and a fairer fare\".\nThe government estimates commuters could save between \u00a360 and \u00a3350 a year on selected journeys.\nHowever, Tony Miles, rail expert and contributor to Modern Railways magazine, said people needed to be cautious because the new system offers a finite number of journeys whereas a season ticket allows people to use the train as much as they want.  \n\"These really aren't season tickets,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"This is a bulk purchase of tickets.\n\"A season ticket effectively gives you unlimited travel,\" he said. \"The big difference with this is you're buying a fixed number of journeys at a discount price but if you decide at a weekend to do some extra journeys that will start ticking off your credit.\"\nThere was already reduced demand for traditional season tickets before the pandemic struck, but the enforced period of working from home has accelerated the trend. Dozens of employers have announced staff will be given the option to work from home at least part of the week after pandemic restrictions are removed.\nAnthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said the changes would help persuade people to choose rail travel again.\n\"Our research with passengers showed us there was strong demand for a new ticket that suited people who expected to commute less frequently in future,\" said Mr Smith. \n\"This is a positive step towards much-needed longer-term reform of how rail tickets are sold. We also welcome the waiving of admin fees for changing tickets, which will help rebuild passenger confidence.\"\nHowever, Transport Focus said it was important that passengers used the calculator to check the costs, as the new flexible tickets would not be the best option for everyone.\nMr Miles said commuters needed to do some \"real heavy thinking\" about whether the new system would offer them value for money. \n\"If you are definitely going to travel two days a week to work and no more, then these probably will be a good thing for you,\" he said.\n\"If you think you are going to travel three days a week, you'd be very careful, and if you think your work will summon you randomly to pop in for extra days during the month, you need to be really careful because you will be using up that credit.\" \nThe Rail Delivery Group (RDG) which represents train operators said the rail companies would like to go further in reforming the fare system, if given the go ahead.\nFor example they would like to see more use of the tap-in, tap-out technology, used on the London Underground, which allows travellers to accumulate journeys and pay the price for a season ticket if they reach the threshold, without having to know their plans in advance and pre-purchase a season ticket.\nAlthough the new flexible season tickets apply to National Rail operations in England, with rail operations devolved in other nations, they are available on cross border commuter routes, for example Bristol to Cardiff, or Berwick to Edinburgh. \nWill you use the new flexible season ticket?

      "tags": "HIV & Aids,UK contaminated blood inquiry",
      "text": "A public inquiry has begun hearing from former students after more than 120 pupils at a school for disabled children were caught up in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.\nFrom 1974 to 1987, those children were offered treatment for haemophilia at Treloar's College. \nAt least 72 died after being given a drug contaminated with HIV and viral hepatitis. \n\"We've lost so many friends from Treloar's and it's absolutely heartbreaking,\" Richard Warwick, a pupil at the Hampshire school in the late 1970s who was later diagnosed with HIV, told the BBC ahead of the hearing. \nThe inquiry into the use of infected blood began taking evidence from people connected to the school on Monday.\nFormer headmaster, Alec Macpherson, is one of those due to answer questions. \"It caused those boys a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset,\" he told the BBC. \n\"It put a rage inside them - why me, why has this happened to me, why have I got this dreadful disease?\"\nLord Mayor's Treloar's College was a boarding school for physically disabled children with a specialist NHS haemophilia centre on site, run by a dedicated medical team. \nBy the mid 1970s, a new treatment for haemophilia, known as factor VIII/IX, became available for the first time. \nIt meant those with a serious form of the blood disorder could live a normal life without the risk of a bleed. \nThe NHS was not self-sufficient in the blood plasma used to make the drug so it was imported from overseas, most notably the US.\nBatches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK. \nAde Goodyear joined Treloar's in 1980 at the age of 10. He described life as \"wonderful\" with supportive teachers, nurses and good friends.\nLike dozens of other boys at the school, he was given factor VIII to help control his bleeding.\n\"With one of my very first shots, I got hepatitis and was placed in isolation for two weeks,\" he said.\nIn 1985 he was taken into a small office with a group of boys to be told he had tested positive for HIV - then a newly discovered virus with no known treatment and a short life expectancy. \n\"The doctor was upset and pointed at us and said, you have it, and you haven't. And I was back in science by 1.50pm. I didn't even get the afternoon off,\" he said.\n\"A friend of mine picked up a pot plant and threw it against the wall of the haemophilia centre. It was a beautiful summer's day and I remember thinking, how many more sunrises like this am I going to see?\"\nAde's two older brothers died after treatment with factor VIII - Jason from Aids in 1997 and Gary from health problems linked to hepatitis C in 2015. \nFor pupils like Ade and Richard it meant living with the stigma of what was then a little-known disease. \nStudents were followed by newspaper reporters outside the school gates and shouted questions about their HIV status.\nJust 32 of the 122 haemophiliacs who attended the school from 1974 to 1987 are still alive today. Most died after contracting HIV or viral hepatitis. \nIt's hoped the public inquiry will be able to answer questions about what happened at Treloar's and the NHS haemophiliac centre run from the site. \nFamilies want to know why they were not told about the potential risks of Factor VIII earlier and why it took many years until the drug was heat treated to kill viruses and other contaminants.\n\"What happened at the school comes back to haunt us every day,\" said Stephen Nicholls, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C after his treatment. \n\"We will never forget the Treloar's story and those memories of what happened here.\"\nIt is a rare genetic condition in which the blood does not clot properly. It mostly affects men. \nPeople with the condition produce lower amounts of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII and IX.\nFormer students are giving evidence this week, some anonymously, along with the parents of children who lost their lives.\nThe haemophilia centre on the site was run by NHS doctors and nurses and not staff directly employed by the school, which still cares for physically disabled children today. \n\"Although no-one has at any point suggested that Treloar's was at fault, it is a tragic part of our past,\" the school said in a statement. \n\"It was, and still is, a very difficult time for our affected alumni, their families and staff who were here at the point.\n\"We are completely supportive of the campaign for truth, answers and justice by our former pupils.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "tags": "Friends,Television",
      "text": "Friends star James Michael Tyler, who played Central Perk waiter Gunther, has said he has stage four prostate cancer.\nIn an interview with NBC's Today show, the 59-year-old revealed he was diagnosed in September 2018 after a routine physical examination.\nThe cancer has since spread to the actor's bones and he can no longer walk. He is undergoing chemotherapy.\n\"Eventually, you know, it's gonna probably get me,\" he told host Craig Melvin.\nSpeaking about his diagnosis, he said: \"I was 56 years old at the time, and they screen for PSA, which is prostate-specific antigen.\n\"That came back at an extraordinarily high number... so I knew immediately when I went online and I saw the results of my blood test and blood work that there was obviously something quite wrong there.\n\"Nearly immediately, my doctor called me and said, 'Hey, I need you to come in tomorrow because I suspect that you may have quite a serious problem with your prostate.'\"\nAfter he missed another test during the pandemic, the cancer spread to his bones, he revealed, and is now at stage four. \"Late stage cancer,\" he confirmed. \"So eventually, you know, it's gonna probably get me.\"\nHe took the opportunity to urge other men to get themselves checked out at their next doctor's appointment. \"There are other options available to men if they catch it before me,\" he said.\nWhile he didn't command the same amount of screen time as the six main Friends characters, Gunther was and remains a popular figure among fans.\nGunther worked as a waiter and manager in the coffee house, Central Perk, and had a crush on Jennifer Anniston's character Rachel throughout the series, who also worked there as a waitress in the show's early seasons.\nHe made a brief appearance on the Friends reunion special last month via Zoom. \"It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly,\" he said of the show.\n\"I could not have imagined just a better experience. All these guys were fantastic and just a joy to work with. It felt very, very special.\"\nSpeaking about not revealing his diagnosis during the reunion, he said: \"I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, and by the way, Gunther has cancer'.\"\nHe added the other cast members knew of his diagnosis. \"David Schwimmer [who played Ross] has corresponded with me via Instagram. The producers are aware, they've been aware for a long time.\"\nTyler appeared on the show throughout its 10-year run and became a viewer favourite thanks to his deadpan delivery.\nHe was reunited with his Friends co-star Matt LeBlanc in 2012 in an episode of the BBC sitcom Episodes, playing an ice hockey coach.\nHis film appearances include in The Disturbance at Dinner, Foreign Correspondents, Motel Blue, and Jason's Big Problem.\nThe Today show displayed photos of Tyler's home life as they interviewed him, including him using a wheelchair, and the actor became emotional as he spoke.\nAsked by the host if he wished he had done anything differently, Tyler replied: \"I would have listened to my wonderful wife - who has been my absolute strength throughout all of this.\n\"I would've gone in earlier and it would've been hopefully caught earlier.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Obviously as a family we had sort of anticipated this eventuality - feared it - year on year,\" Philip Musson said.\n\"He took their lives in a way which is an absolute torment to those who cared and loved these girls.\"\nSouth Leicestershire MP Alberto Costa, who had met with the Parole Board over Pitchfork's case, previously said he was \"appalled\" at the news of Pitchfork's release.\nHe said he would \"work [his] socks off to make sure [the decision] is reconsidered and he is kept behind bars.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "People aged 40 and over in Wales will get their second Covid jab within eight weeks of their first, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has pledged.\nThe promise is subject to supply and comes as Wales' vaccine programme switches focus to second doses.\nA health official said there was good evidence suggesting two doses helped reduce the risk of needing hospital treatment from the Delta variant.\nIt comes as the number of Delta cases rises to 579, up from 490 last week.\nLast Friday First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales was at the start of a third wave of coronavirus, driven by the variant first discovered in India.\nAbout four in five new cases of Covid are caused by Delta - and there are warnings that in the worst case scenario there could be more cases than in January.\nBaroness Morgan told Monday's Welsh government press conference that in addition to the pledge on over-40s, the NHS will also be focused on offering a second dose to everyone over 50, all healthcare workers, social care workers, and other vulnerable groups, including care home residents.\n\"Between now and mid-July, we will be putting an extra half a million vaccines into the system, focusing on second doses and getting people fully protected,\" she said.\nDeputy chief medical officer Chris Jones said it was important to have two doses of the vaccine.\n\"Across the UK, we are starting to see an increase in the number of people who have been admitted to hospital, although at the moment, this remains relatively low, which suggests vaccination is providing strong protection against infection and severe disease,\" he said.\nAbout two-thirds of the people admitted to hospital in England were not vaccinated, compared to 11% who were fully vaccinated, he said.\nHowever, he added there were still uncertainties about vaccination.\nDr Jones said the modelling for the worst-case scenario, where the variant is more transmissible and the vaccine is the least effective, \"suggests we could have still a very sizable third peak and possibly even larger than January\".\nThe health minister said the prospect of further Covid lockdowns would depend on how the public responds to the restrictions in place.\nBaroness Morgan said: \"If they did follow the suggestions when it comes to social distancing and wearing masks and washing hands regularly, then that would certainly help the situation.\"\n\"Winter is a long way away, and at some point we are going to have to learn to live with this virus. But what we don't do in the Welsh government is make any promises that we can't keep.\""

      "text": "Some women are made to feel that their pain is something to endure, not a problem to solve, particularly when it comes to gynaecological procedures such as having a coil fitted, says the BBC's Naga Munchetty.\nShe has been sharing her own traumatic experience with Radio 5 Live. \nNaga says her screams were so loud that her husband tried to find out what room she was in, to make the procedure stop. \nThe nurse assisting had tears in her eyes, Naga recalls. \n\"We all know that coils are safe and effective and lots of women have no problem at all with them,\" she explains, \"but like all medical procedures, there's a vast range of experiences.\"\nThe NHS advises: \"Let the person fitting your IUD know if you feel any pain or discomfort while you are having it fitted. You can ask to stop at any time. \n\"Some people might find it painful, but you can have a local anaesthetic to help.\n\"It can be uncomfortable when the IUD is put in, but you can take painkillers after, if you need to.\"\nNaga decided to speak out after reading an article in The Times by author Caitlin Moran with the headline Why we all need pain relief when having an IUD fitted. \nCaitlin writes: \"Why is it presumed that women will be fine with having their cervix artificially dilated with a pair of metal barbecue tongs before having what is basically the wire coat hanger from a doll's house inserted into their uterus? We know that opening the cervix is infamously painful: it's legendary that when it happens \"naturally\", during birth, it tends to \"chafe\" a bit.\"\nNaga says what she thought would be a routine procedure to have an IUD fitted a few years ago turned into an agonising ordeal.\n\"I'd been told to take a couple of paracetamol and ibuprofen in the hours before my appointment.\n\"Now, I've never been pregnant, therefore my cervix, up until then, had never been opened.\n\"I was told that the smallest size speculum, which was used for cervical smear tests, wasn't big enough for this procedure, so I had to have the next size up. That's when the pain began.\"\nNaga says she was then asked by her GP if she wanted the procedure to stop.\n\"But I was so determined that the pain I'd suffered so far wouldn't be repeated, so I said 'we've got this far let's finish it'. I fainted twice.\"\nNaga says at no point was she offered sedation or anaesthetic, although she made it clear that her GP was \"really great\" and professional. \n\"She [my GP] said she couldn't believe I had stuck with it. She said 'most women just give up when it hurts that much'. She also said that she had felt terrible herself after my fitting.\"\nNaga opted to have her coil removed a year later. \"The pain again was excruciating. I fainted again, and then I burst into tears of relief. \n\"I felt violated, weak and angry. I have friends who have had very similar experiences, and of course I have friends who have had no problem at all. What this is about is not the coil itself. We know it is safe and effective. \n\"What this is about is how we look at all women's health and pain.\"\nDr Dawn Harper, GP and broadcaster, said Naga's experience was not typical: \"For most women, it's a little bit uncomfortable. It's a bit like period pain.\"\nShe said it could be more painful for women who had never had a baby , meaning their cervix had not dilated before.\n\"We absolutely should be taking any kind of pain...very seriously and we should be offering appropriate relief,\" she said.\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Manchester,Salford,Coronavirus pandemic,Andy Burnham",
      "text": "Scotland's first minister has defended the ban on non-essential travel with Manchester and Salford after an angry reaction from the area's mayor.\nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has now written to Nicola Sturgeon asking her to explain the move.\nMs Sturgeon earlier said the decision was a public health measure, based on Covid levels in the area.\nOpposition politicians in Scotland said there had been a lack of consistency and a lack of consultation.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon - who received her second vaccination in Glasgow on Monday - said she had a \"duty\" to keep Scotland as safe as possible.\n\"I have always got on well with Andy Burnham. If he wants a grown-up conversation he only has to pick up the phone,\" she said.\n\"But if, as I suspect might be the case, this is more about getting into a spat with me as part of a some positioning in a Labour leadership contest of the future, then I am not interested.\"\nThe first minister said she was \"confused\" by Mr Burnham's position.\n\"Back in May we imposed travel restrictions on Bolton for exactly the same reasons we are now doing it on Manchester,\" she said.\n\"Andy Burnham is mayor of Bolton as well and he did not raise any of these issues then.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the restrictions would not be enforced differently to previous travel rules, and would be in place \"no longer than is absolutely necessary\".\nMr Burnham acknowledged the first minister has faced \"difficult decisions\" during the pandemic but condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: \"The UK government has called me when they were making changes affecting Greater Manchester.  I think the first minister should have extended us the same courtesy.\n\"If Westminster had, without notice, imposed a travel ban on Scotland on Friday, I feel pretty certain in saying the first minister would have expressed publicly her concern in exactly the same way I am doing that on behalf of the people of Greater Manchester.\"  \nMr Burnham's letter to the first minister also asks why residents of Bolton are still subject to a travel ban while residents of Dundee, which he said has a higher case rate, are not. \nIn Dundee the latest seven-day positive test rate per 100,000 population, up to 18 June, was 303.4. On Monday the seven-day figure in Bolton was 257. \nMr Burnham also called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket and described the suggestion he was playing politics as \"fairly insulting\". \nMurdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesman for Covid recovery, said Mr Burnham was \"absolutely correct\" to express concern about the ban and the \"lack of consultation\".\nMr Fraser told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme there was a \"lack of consistency\" in the Scottish government's approach.\n\"We know that the city of Dundee, for example, has case rates very similar to Manchester,\" he said.\n\"So why is there a travel ban being introduced for Scots going to Manchester, but there are no similar restrictions put in, in relation to Dundee?\"\nDundee, which has the highest Covid case rate in Scotland, recorded 487 new cases in the week up to 18 June, according to UK government figures.\nManchester recorded 1,928 cases and Salford 880 in the same period, but the rate per 100,000 people for all three areas is very similar.\nJackie Baillie, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said people would find the ban hard to understand.\n\"This has just been put in place without any consultation, without any dialogue and without any concern for either the people of Manchester or the tourism industry in Scotland,\" she said.\n\"Are we consistent in saying it's OK to travel in and out of areas of Scotland where the rates of infection are higher than they are in Manchester? That's the inconsistency that people just do not understand.\"\nAre you affected by the ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford? Have you had to change your plans? Please share your stories and pictures with us.\nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said the provisions that had been put in place were \"consistent\" with approaches taken in the area previously.\nNon-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton in Greater Manchester, and Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, on 24 May.\nMr Burnham said he would be writing to the Scottish government to ask how it would compensate businesses in Manchester who could lose bookings.\nBut Mr Swinney said that would not be \"appropriate\".\nAsked whether similar travel restrictions should be introduced in Dundee, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government would need to look \"very carefully\" at \"localised situations\".\nMother-of-two Renu Bhardwaj had been due to travel to Manchester this weekend.\n\"The children are finishing school in four days and we had plans to go down and meet my family again and enjoy the summer holidays, or make the most of what we can,\" she said.\nThe lifestyle blogger, who moved to Glasgow 13 years ago, used to make regular trips south to visit her relatives before the pandemic.\nShe said she could understand the reasoning behind the decision, but that the timing, so close to the school holidays, was \"the worst for everybody\". \nPolice Scotland said its approach throughout the pandemic remains the same.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: \"Officers will engage with the public, explain the legislation and encourage compliance, but will not hesitate to use enforcement as a last resort. \n\"The Chief Constable has said publicly on numerous occasions that we will not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks, and that will not change.\"\nOn Monday, the UK recorded another 10,633 Covid cases - including 8,766 cases for England and 1,250 for Scotland.\nBoth nations have seen rising seven-day infection rates, with the Scottish rate at 131.7 per 100,000 people and 92.7 per 100,000 people in England on 18 June.\nScotland, which has one of the highest infection rates in Europe but also one of the highest vaccination rates, has paused the lifting of Covid restrictions this summer because of rising cases."

      "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy paper Apple Daily has said its board will decide whether or not to close the publication at a meeting on Friday.\nThis comes days after officials froze HK$18m ($2.3m; \u00a31.64m) of its assets over allegations that its reports breached a national security law. \nPolice also detained its chief editor and five other executives. Its founder Jimmy Lai is already in jail. \nApple Daily is frequently critical of mainland Chinese leadership.\n\"The Board will decide on Friday whether [it] will continue to operate... if it decides not to... the newspaper will cease operation after publishing the June 26 edition,\" said Reuters quoting an internal memo. \nEarlier on Monday, Lai's adviser Mark Simon had told the BBC's Peter Hoskins that the paper could close \"within days\". \n\"If you don't have money you can't order services. Most importantly, you can't promise to pay people when you don't have access to the cash to cover those expenses. That's illegal in Hong Kong,\" said Mr Simon.\n\"The paper is still on the news stands today but it is only a matter of days before it won't be there unless its bank accounts are unfrozen.\"\nApple Daily had on Sunday said it only had enough cash to continue normal operations for \"several weeks\". \nLast Thursday, some 500 police officers raided the offices of Apple Daily in Hong Kong, saying its reports had breached the national security law.\nPolice also arrested the editor-in-chief and four other executives at their homes and froze HK$18m ($2.3m; \u00a31.64m) of assets owned by three companies linked to Apple Daily - Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited and AD internet Limited. \nPhotos published online by Apple Daily showed police going through reporters' computers.\nIn a statement, police said their warrant \"covered the power of searching and seizure of journalistic materials\".\nIn a press briefing later that day, police said that Apple Daily had published more than 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China since 2019. \nJimmy Lai, the paper's founder, is currently in jail for a series of charges, including participating in an unauthorised assembly in 2019.\nLai is one of the most prominent supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. \nEstimated to be worth more than $1bn (\u00a3766m), he made his initial fortune in the clothing industry and later ventured into media and founded Next Digital.\nIn May, authorities froze assets belonging to Lai, including his bank accounts and his stake of 71.26% in Next Digital - estimated to be worth $45m. \nBanking giants HSBC and Citibank were also sent letters by Hong Kong's security chief, who threatened up to seven years' jail for any dealings with Mr Lai's accounts in the city. \nIn his last interview with the BBC before he was sentenced to jail, he said he would not give in to intimidation.\n\"If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it. The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you,\" he said.\nThe national security law was introduced in 2020 in response to massive pro-democracy protests that swept the city state the previous year.\nIt essentially reduced Hong Kong's judicial autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. It criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces with the maximum sentence life in prison.\nBeijing said the law would target \"sedition\" and bring stability, but critics have said it violates the agreement under which Britain handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997.\nSince the law was enacted in June, more than 100 people have been arrested under its provisions, including Lai."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,NHS England,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Plans for a Covid booster jab programme in the autumn will be set out in the next few weeks, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe health secretary said ministers were waiting for results from trials of different combinations of vaccines.\nIt comes after doctors and NHS trusts said planning for a booster rollout must start now as it will involve bigger challenges. \nThey said many questions needed answering, including how long immunity from the original Covid jab lasts.\nThe issue of whether children will be vaccinated also still remains, health leaders said. \n\"We are currently trialling which combinations of jabs are the most effective,\" Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast. \n\"In the next few weeks, when we get the clinical data through on what's the most effective combinations to have\u2026 then we'll set out all the details for the booster programme for the autumn.\"\nAmong the ongoing trials is the UK's Cov-Boost trial, which is testing different combinations of third doses.  \nA senior government source said the UK would also benefit from new vaccines from Novavax and Valneva, which are awaiting approval from the UK's medicines regulator. \nSo far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two jabs of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose.\nPeople have been rushing to get their vaccines in recent days, with more than one million jabs booked on Friday and Saturday in England after vaccinations opened to all over-18s.\nMinisters have repeatedly said that vaccination is the way out of lockdown, and the delay to England's lockdown ending from 21 June until 19 July was partly to allow more people to get vaccinated.\nSome restrictions have been eased on Monday though, the original date for lockdown ending - and what some had dubbed Freedom Day. \nThe number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue.\nAnd in Wales, rules are also being lifted slightly, including Covid capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.\nIn Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotland are expected to be extended until mid-July. \nThe average number of daily confirmed cases of coronavirus is now rising in the UK, with a further 9,284 announced by the government on Sunday. A further six deaths were announced.\nOn Monday, Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals and trusts in England, and Royal College of GPs chairman Martin Marshall said the 19 July target to offer a first dose to all adults was \"not so much a finishing line as a staging post\".\nThe government has previously promised there will be a booster programme for the Covid jab - but the health leaders said the prospect of a yearly Covid vaccine would bring \"arguably greater challenges\", and it was important to know:\nThey also said combining the Covid and flu vaccine rollouts - for example a Covid jab in one arm and a flu jab in the other - needed to be explored, but that would make the rollout more complex.\nAnd they said there needed to be investment in proper vaccination venues rather than relying on sports stadiums or community facilities.\n\"Since flu jabs start in September we need ministers and the JCVI - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - to really answer those questions as quickly as possible, so we're ready to administer the jabs we need to in the autumn,\" Mr Hopson told the BBC.\nMr Hopson and Mr Marshall said there needed to be a sustainable approach to vaccination, which meant the NHS could carry on vaccinating while also doing its other work.\n\"We cannot just carry on as we are, with an emergency response largely delivered by an overstretched workforce,\" they said.\nThey are asking questions rather than coming up with solutions but health leaders have identified a major challenge for the coming winter. \nOffering a first dose to all adults by 19 July is seen as just a first step in a long haul with Covid. \nGiven that booster vaccines will be needed, GPs and NHS trusts want to know the logistics of what will be a complex process on top of the usual winter pressures and dealing with the backlog of non-urgent work. \nDoctors and their practice teams have gone the extra mile to help deliver the Covid vaccination programme but they want to ensure day-to-day patient care is not compromised. \nThe flu season might seem some way off but the normal vaccination campaigns and rollout start in September each year.  \nHence the call for ministers to come with some answers and longer term plans soon. \nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, which advises UK health departments on vaccination, said decisions on booster jabs would be \"based on the best available evidence\" but the committee was also conscious of the need for the programme to be planned by the NHS.  \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme data on how flu and Covid vaccines could react to each other if given together would be available \"very soon\". \nProf Harnden added that flu could be \"potentially a bigger problem\" than Covid this winter because of the low prevalence in the last few years, particularly during lockdown, meaning the level of immunity in the population had dropped. \nOn whether under-18s could be offered a Covid vaccine, he said \"we need to think very carefully what the benefits are to children themselves\", and the JCVI would be considering this in the next few weeks. \nThe committee has not yet made a formal recommendation on the matter.\nThe World Health Organization has previously urged rich countries like the UK to donate doses to poorer countries before organising booster jabs."

The Australian women's softball squad arrived on 1 June.\nForeign spectators have been banned from the Olympics. A decision is expected to be taken on Monday on whether to allow domestic spectators. \nHaving no spectators at the Games is the \"least risky\" option, Japanese medical experts have said.\nBut other Japanese officials have indicated they want domestic fans to attend if possible.\nTokyo reported 376 cases of Covid and one death on 20 June, 72 more than a week ago, the privately owned The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.\nPolls in local media suggest public scepticism about the Games taking place remains high amid a slow vaccine roll-out.\nOnly about 16% of Japan's population has received a Covid-19 vaccination dose so far, according to Reuters news agency.\nOfficials and volunteers working on the Games started receiving vaccinations on Friday.\nIn Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni announced a ban on road travel, except for vehicles carrying tourists, and workers in emergency and other essential services. \nHe also closed schools, universities and places of worship for 42 days.\nThe restrictions were necessary because of a \"more aggressive and sustained growth\" of the virus, Mr Museveni said. \nOver the last three weeks, the daily number of people testing positive had risen from less than 100 to more than 1,700, he said.  \n\"We are experiencing very high hospitalisation rates and deaths for Covid-19 patients among all age categories,\" the president added."

      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "Social care organisations have urged ministers to publish long-awaited plans to overhaul how the sector in England is funded within a month.\nThey have called on Boris Johnson to \"act now\" and set out proposals before Parliament's summer recess begins on 22 July.\nThere have been reports the PM would host a meeting this week with senior ministers to discuss reform ideas.\nThe government has pledged to publish funding plans by the end of the year. \nIn a letter to the prime minister, seven bodies representing those providing and using social care said the \"time to deliver reform is now\".\nAs well as long-term changes to funding, they also urged an \"immediate\" cash injection to cover short-term costs incurred during the Covid pandemic.\nCouncils in England should get money to invest in new technology, they said, and there should be a \"new deal\" for staff working in the sector. \nSignatories of the letter include the Care Provider Alliance, the Social Care Institute for Excellence, and Adass, a charity supporting member councils with responsibility for social care. \nThe government has been criticised for not announcing a new bill on social care funding at the start of the parliamentary year in May. \nWhen he entered Downing Street in July 2019, Mr Johnson vowed to fix the funding crisis \"with a clear plan we have prepared\".\nBut reports suggest that discussions are still ongoing within government about the potential cost of changes, which could run into the billions.\nIn England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 can get help from their council.\nThere is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay.\nPersonal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs.\nSome care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland.\nDespite a series of reform proposals put forward, plans for a wider overhaul of funding have been scuppered under different parties in recent decades.\nPlans to introduce a lifetime cap on costs were put into law in 2014, following a commission chaired by former UK statistics chief Sir Andrew Dilnot.\nHowever, they were delayed and then eventually ditched under ex-PM David Cameron. His successor, Theresa May, later suggested and then abandoned a form of the proposals in 2017.\nIn May last year, the BBC learned that before the coronavirus outbreak ministers had been considering proposals to introduce a cap care costs in England.\nSpeaking on Monday, Sir Andrew said there was a \"general awareness\" within government that \"we've got to get something done here\".\nThe policy choice over how to fix the system seems pretty much to have been made already.\nIt might seem frustrating that after all of this time, the changes are likely to be those that were mooted years ago.\nBut the political decision, however, on how to pay for fixing the social care system in England has not.\nRead more from Laura\nSir Andrew told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that as well as a cap, there should be a \"significant increase\" in the generosity of the means-test for support.\nHe said his plans would cost an extra \u00a33-5bn per year, on top of an extra \u00a35bn the Treasury would have to spend anyway due to England's aging population.\nUrging ministers to \"be generous,\" he said the overall cost was \"not huge\" compared to wider public spending, and would have a \"massive\" impact on individuals.\nUrging the PM to \"grasp the nettle,\" former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the initial costs of Dilnot-style changes would be \"easily manageable\".\nWriting in the Daily Mail, he said costs would only then increase after the \"immediate post-pandemic period\".\nLabour's shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall said the government should present its plans to Parliament \"as soon as possible\".\n\"We have been waiting almost two years to see the 'clear plan' for social care that [Mr Johnson] claimed to have prepared, and all we've heard about it is nine words in the Queen's Speech\", she added. \nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said the government would be \"bringing forward some good plans in due course\"."

      "text": "The South African government says that stones found in a village last month are not diamonds but quartz.\nA cattle herder first uncovered the stones in KwaZulu-Natal province. It prompted thousands to rush to KwaHlathi village, more than 300km (186 miles) south-east of Johannesburg. \nBut after conducting tests, officials have said the stones are quartz crystals, which are far less valuable.\nAfter feldspar, quartz is the most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust.\n\"The tests conducted conclusively revealed that the stones discovered in the area are not diamonds,\" a local government statement reportedly said. \nThe rush occurred in one of South Africa's poorest regions. \nThe country - which already suffers from high levels of economic inequality - has seen a surge in joblessness amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to Johns Hopkins University data, South Africa has recorded more cases than any other country on the continent, with 1.8 million confirmed infections and nearly 60,000 deaths reported.\nNomsa Maseko, BBC Southern African correspondent\nThe discovery of what was believed to be diamonds in KwaHlathi exposed deep frustrations of communities desperate to find a way out of poverty.\nStudies carried out in the area have revealed that the site where the stones were found is geographically located on the edge of the Karoo dolerite sill, which is not in a zone where diamonds are normally found. \nThe council for Geoscience will be carrying out further studies to find out if there are any other minerals that may create jobs and improve the lives of tens of thousands of people who live in the area. \nThe government has asked people to stop digging because illegal mining practices have a negative impact on the environment."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nBoris Johnson has said 19 July is still \"looking good\" for the date when all Covid restrictions can be lifted in England, although he has downplayed any suggestion this date might come earlier. The prime minister said cases of the Delta variant, first identified in India, were still rising and the priority was to keep other variants out of the UK. It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when they come into contact with someone who has Covid.\nScotland's first minister has defended the decision to impose a ban on non-essential travel with Manchester and Salford because of high Covid rates. Nicola Sturgeon said she had a \"duty\" to keep Scotland as safe as possible. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham continued his criticism of the restrictions, saying he felt people in his region had been \"insulted\" by the move and a lack of consultation. He had previously called for compensation for people affected. One of those is bride-to-be Rachel Godiff, from Salford, who has cancelled her honeymoon to Scotland.\nWales football fans have been told not to travel to Amsterdam for the next round of Euro 2020 in the Netherlands. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said police in Amsterdam had advised that they would not be \"letting Welsh fans into the country\". The Netherlands is on the UK's amber list, meaning travel is not advised, while the UK is not on the Netherlands' safe country list. Wales will face either Belgium, Finland, Russia or Denmark in their last-16 match in Amsterdam on Saturday.\nScotland midfielder Billy Gilmour will miss his side's final Euro 2020 group stage game with Croatia on Tuesday after testing positive for Covid. The Scottish Football Association currently say there are no close contacts identified from inside the team's camp. He played in Friday's goalless draw with England - who later said their duo of Ben Chilwell and Mason Mount would have to self-isolate as a precaution after coming into close contact with the Scottish player.\nA man who spent 59 days in intensive care with Covid-19 has climbed Wales' highest peak with his 11-year-old daughter - and some NHS workers who treated him. Leighton Webster, 43, a father-of-three from Redditch, was on a ventilator in a coma for six weeks last year and is recovering from lung damage. He said it felt \"amazing\" to reach the top of Snowdon \"with the people that helped me at my worst - the brilliant NHS staff\".

      "tags": "Wales business,Live music,Cardiff,Newport,Pubs,Music",
      "text": "Covid capacity rules in music and comedy venues have been slightly relaxed in another minor easing of Wales' lockdown restrictions.\nThe number of guests attending wedding receptions and wakes has also changed in Wales on Monday, allowing venues to host as many people as they can safely.\nWales' first minister said he will pause major relaxations for four weeks due to the start of a third Covid wave.\nRules for music and comedy venues are now \"in line\" with hospitality venues.\nSo, like pubs and restaurants, the changes mean groups of six people from six households can attend music and comedy venues in Wales.\nNow numbers allowed into each venue will be based on its size instead of being limited to 30 as businesses must follow strict Covid guidelines, like having one-way systems and appropriate ventilation.\nBut while welcoming the amendments, there are worries in Wales' music industry that operating with social distancing in place could make it \"not economically viable\" for venues.\nRapper Eggsy, a member of Newport hip hop group Goldie Lookin Chain, is worried for small venues and fears live local music won't be back until 2022.\n\"Our gigs have been pushed back and back,\" he said.\n\"Will venues be able to make a profit with reduced crowds? That will affect who they are booking.\n\"You might be able to get a few local bands that won't cost a lot but getting bands in and making a profit will be hard.\"\nGLC, who have had three top 20 hits, are planning on an autumn tour in 2021 which includes seven Welsh dates.\nBut Eggsy, real name John Rutledge, admits: \"I don't think live music will be back on for a long time, next year at the earliest. I hope I am wrong, but it is still looking crazy.\n\"But hopefully these changes in the rules will give small venues a bit of a breather and a chance to make a bit of money.\"\nMark Drakeford wanted \"grassroots\" music venues - like Clwb Ifor Bach in Cardiff, Swansea's Sin City and Pavilion Mid Wales in Llandrindod Wells - to come \"in line\" with rest of the hospitality sector.\nWhile the Music Venue Trust \"appreciate\" the slight easing of restrictions from Wales' first minister, the organisation that represents 50 gig venues in Wales is concerned.\n\"It's not economically viable,\" said chief executive Mark Davyd.\n\"Venues will be doing it to reconnect with customers. It is good news everything is moving forward. Not as fast as we would like but we appreciate everything Mark Drakeford has done.\n\"But how many venues will be able to open in Wales is a slightly different question, because they still have to do social distancing.\"\nHe thinks some venues might \"try to do two shows a day instead of one\" in an attempt to turn a profit.\n\"They also might try and introduce seated food gigs, so it will be more like a dining experience,\" said Mr Davyd.\nHe said venues \"need to make sure that that what we are doing makes sense\" as they wanted \"to drive toward full capacity reopening\". \nNewport's Le Pub is also a well-known small music venue and its manger Sam Dabb thinks the new guidance is \"sensible\".\n\"The last guidance that brought in a weird caveat that put even places like the Tramshed (capacity 1,000 people) at a maximum of 30 people,\" she said.\n\"It's sensible and I think it is perfectly safe because it is set by assessing venue size.\n\"I think what they now need to do is work on the fact that event guidance for large events, like in Cardiff Castle.\"\nRules covering wedding and civil partnerships receptions and wakes in Wales will also change on Monday and there will no longer be limits on numbers at weddings.\nFollowing a risk assessment by venues, the first minister said numbers will be based on how many can be \"safely accommodated\".\nMr Drakeford said changes meant venues would move away from having a notional number, adding: \"If those can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do.\"\nHe added it would mean \"at quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now\".\nPilot events in theatre, sport and other sectors will also continue through June and July ahead of Wales' next lockdown rules review on 15 July.\nThe other amendment to Wales' rules is that primary school children in the same school contact group or bubble will be able to stay overnight in a residential outdoor education centre.

      "text": "The party of Armenia's acting PM Nikol Pashinyan has won snap elections, the country's electoral commission says.\nPreliminary results from all 2,008 polling stations give the Civil Contract party 54%, it says.\nThe opposition Armenia alliance led by ex-President Robert Kocharyan is a distant second with 21%. The block has alleged election fraud.\nThe vote was called after Armenia's defeat in a war with Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.\nLast year, Azerbaijan regained control of large swathes of the mountainous region, which it lost to Armenia during the first Nagorno-Karabakh war in 1988-94.\nThe region is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan.\nEarlier on Monday, Mr Pashinyan declared victory in the elections, urging supporters to gather in the main square of the capital Yerevan in the evening.\n\"The people of Armenia gave our Civil Contract party a mandate to lead the country and personally me to lead the country as prime minister,\" he said.\n\"We already know that we won a convincing victory in the elections and we will have a convincing majority in parliament.\"\nAlmost 50% of the country's 2.6 million eligible voters cast ballots on Sunday, Armenian election officials said, adding that the vote was carried out in accordance with legislation.\nMr Kocharyan's alliance said it would not recognise Mr Pashinyan's claim of victory.\n\"Hundreds of signals from polling stations testifying to organised and planned falsifications serve as a serious reason for lack of trust,\" the bloc said in a statement.\nOn Sunday evening the general prosecutor's office said it had received 319 reports of violations, and had opened six criminal investigations. All of these were related to alleged bribery during campaigning.\nMr Kocharyan, a friend and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was himself previously accused of fixing a presidential election in favour of a political ally. \nHe was also accused of presiding over a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2008.\nMr Pashinyan came to power after leading a popular revolution in 2018, and Armenia was praised by some international countries when it held its first free and fair election under his leadership that year.\nBut the country has been in a political crisis since November 2020, when Mr Pashinyan signed a Moscow-brokered truce with Azerbaijan to end the Nagorno-Karabakh war.\nOfficially, 2,904 Azerbaijani servicemen lost their lives in last year's war. Armenia lost an estimated 4,000 servicemen."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be offered to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK, following updated advice from the UK's vaccine committee.\nAll over-18s across the UK can have two Covid vaccine doses, as can some vulnerable, high-risk children over 12.\nHealthy, low-risk children between 12 and 15 have only been offered a single dose - which should be delayed until 12 weeks after a coronavirus infection.\nThe Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says a second dose for those aged 16 and 17 is safe and effective 12 weeks after the first.\nThe JCVI has previously held back from recommending a second dose because of concerns over a very rare heart condition, called myocarditis, experienced by tiny numbers of young people - particularly boys - after the second dose.\nIt says it is now reassured by evidence from other countries that a 12-week gap between doses would lower that already very small risk.\nA decision on a second dose for 12-15s has not yet been made but could happen in the next few weeks.\nIn the meantime, all 12-17 year olds should wait 12 weeks after a Covid infection before having their first or second dose.\nNo vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nIf you're over 18, and want to book your first, second or booster dose, you can find out how here.\nNo. If you're under 40 or pregnant you'll be given Pfizer or Moderna.\nEvery woman who is pregnant (or planning to become pregnant) is encouraged to get two vaccine doses. Hospital figures show that 98% of pregnant women admitted to intensive care this year were not vaccinated.\nUnder-18s have so far been offered Pfizer. \nThe vaccines are very effective at protecting people against becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid-19. \nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests more than 90% protection against hospitalisation and death with all three vaccines.\nThe vaccines are less effective at stopping people becoming infected by the virus, developing mild symptoms or passing it on - but they do reduce the risk of that happening too.\nIf you've been double-jabbed, you are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nCovid vaccines aren't compulsory, but everyone is urged to get jabbed to protect themselves, their family, friends and wider society.\nChildren under 16 don't need parental consent to get jabbed, as long as they are believed to have \"enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment\". This is known as \"Gillick competence\". \nBeing fully vaccinated can make travelling to most other countries easier, and in many cases means you will not have to self-isolate either when you return to the UK. \nHowever, it's worth bearing in mind that under-16s are not eligible for their own digital NHS Covid Pass, which is now accepted widely as proof of vaccination. \nWhat's more, the single jab which most UK teenagers have so far received, is not recognised as full vaccination by some countries (including France), and more tests may be required.\nCheck your destination's rules on the Foreign Office website before you travel. \nMost are mild, completely normal and disappear after a few days. \nThey happen because the body's defences are reacting to the vaccine, and include:\nA very small number of people had a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so you should discuss any allergies you have before vaccination.\nThere's no evidence to suggest you should avoid alcohol altogether, but drinking in large quantities can suppress your immune system.\nSome women have experienced unusually heavy, painful or prolonged periods after being jabbed.\nThis may be because the vaccine prompts an increase in activity in the immune system, which also plays a role in the menstrual cycle. \nHowever, there's no evidence  the vaccine has any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nPregnant women are being urged to get the vaccine, to protect themselves and their babies.\nCoronavirus can cause serious illness in some women in later pregnancy, and possibly a slightly higher rate of stillbirth.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy or are breastfeeding, government guidance says you can still get vaccinated, \nA recent study suggests vaccination can help improve long Covid symptoms.\nResearchers think the vaccine could be pressing the body's reset button and helping it recover.

      "title": "Wimbledon: Fans frustrated as Ticketmaster cancels tickets",
      "text": "Lucy Rayner was jubilant when she managed to buy tickets to Wimbledon's men's final day, but five days later she received an email from Ticketmaster cancelling her purchase.\n\"It was gutting,\" says Lucy. \nShe and her family had unwittingly breached the sales terms, by using the same credit card on more than one transaction.\nThey say the rules were unclear, meaning they've missed out on dream tickets for this year's tournament.\nThey aren't the only ones. Dozens of upset tennis fans have taken to Twitter to complain about tickets that have suddenly been cancelled, several days after they were bought.\nAs for many popular events, there is a rule against buying more than two tickets. But customers say neither the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), nor Ticketmaster the platform which operates the ticket sales, made clear that they would crosscheck use of the same credit card. Both organisations say that the terms and conditions were made quite clear at \"multiple locations\".\nLike many other tennis superfans, Lucy, her sister Holly and her mother Marion, gathered round their laptops last Thursday, ready for the moment when tickets went on sale. They'd had tickets for last year's cancelled tournament and were more eager than ever to get to see this year's.\nThey waited in three separate virtual queues, each using their own MyWimbledon account set up for the purpose. \n\"They'd released three codes on our individual emails,\" says Marion. \n\"They'd asked us to read the pre-purchase ticket information and we had scanned it,\" she adds. \"There was nothing as far as we were aware saying you had to use different credit cards.\" \nWhen they managed to buy first a pair of tickets for number one court on 8 July, then a pair for ladies' finals day, and finally a pair for men's finals day, they were in a hurry to complete each purchase. \nSo they paid with the same card \"just out of convenience, it was handy and we already had it out and because of the time pressure to secure the tickets,\" says Lucy. If they'd been aware of the rule they wouldn't have.\nThere is always strong demand for Wimbledon tickets, but the competition is higher than ever this year as Covid rules mean reduced crowds.  \nAnd many fans are saying they now feel cheated. \nSeveral tweeted that they had made an initial ticket purchase, but then, after waiting in virtual queues, they managed to secure better tickets, so had cancelled the first purchase.\nTheir own cancellations went through, but their subsequent purchases were also later revoked by Ticketmaster, they said, leaving them with no tickets.\nOthers said they had logged in on behalf of relatives, to help them navigate the online system, or because they were out at work, and paid for the tickets as a gift, or because they didn't have access to their relative's credit cards. They later found Ticketmaster had identified the repeated use of their credit card and cancelled the second transaction.\nThe AELTC said: \"Under the AELTC's Conditions of Sale, the purchase of more than two tickets by any one credit card is strictly prohibited. \n\"Regrettably, people who purchased more than two tickets using one credit card were contacted by Ticketmaster to advise that any transactions beyond the purchase limit would be cancelled.\n\"We appreciate the disappointment this will have caused to those affected, but these conditions were clearly stated in multiple locations on the website, and at the 'accept and continue' stage of the ticket purchase.\"\nOne customer highlighted that the AELTC's own terms and conditions, that are over 9,000 words long, don't contain any mention of the rule covering credit card use.\nHowever, Ticketmaster supplied a screenshot of the terms it said customers were shown during the purchase process, which stated \"Please note: There is a ticket limit of two tickets per person and per credit card on this event.\"\nIt said the ticket limit of two per person and per credit card had been a long-standing Wimbledon policy in order to ensure that tickets are as fairly distributed as possible."

      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "Social care organisations have urged ministers to publish long-awaited plans to overhaul how the sector in England is funded within a month.\nThey have called on Boris Johnson to \"act now\" and set out proposals before Parliament's summer recess begins on 22 July.\nThere have been reports the PM would host a meeting this week with senior ministers to discuss reform ideas.\nThe government has pledged to publish funding plans by the end of the year. \nIn a letter to the prime minister, seven bodies representing those providing and using social care said the \"time to deliver reform is now\".\nAs well as long-term changes to funding, they also urged an \"immediate\" cash injection to cover short-term costs incurred during the Covid pandemic.\nCouncils in England should get money to invest in new technology, they said, and there should be a \"new deal\" for staff working in the sector. \nSignatories of the letter include the Care Provider Alliance, the Social Care Institute for Excellence, and Adass, a charity supporting member councils with responsibility for social care. \nThe government has been criticised for not announcing a new bill on social care funding at the start of the parliamentary year in May. \nWhen he entered Downing Street in July 2019, Mr Johnson vowed to fix the funding crisis \"with a clear plan we have prepared\".\nBut reports suggest that discussions are still ongoing within government about the potential cost of changes, which could run into the billions.\nIn England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 can get help from their council.\nThere is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay.\nPersonal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs.\nSome care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland.\nDespite a series of reform proposals put forward, plans for a wider overhaul of funding have been scuppered under different parties in recent decades.\nPlans to introduce a lifetime cap on costs were put into law in 2014, following a commission chaired by former UK statistics chief Sir Andrew Dilnot.\nHowever, they were delayed and then eventually ditched under ex-PM David Cameron. His successor, Theresa May, later suggested and then abandoned a form of the proposals in 2017.\nIn May last year, the BBC learned that before the coronavirus outbreak ministers had been considering proposals to introduce a cap care costs in England.\nSpeaking on Monday, Sir Andrew said there was a \"general awareness\" within government that \"we've got to get something done here\".\nThe policy choice over how to fix the system seems pretty much to have been made already.\nIt might seem frustrating that after all of this time, the changes are likely to be those that were mooted years ago.\nBut the political decision, however, on how to pay for fixing the social care system in England has not.\nRead more from Laura\nSir Andrew told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that as well as a cap, there should be a \"significant increase\" in the generosity of the means-test for support.\nHe said his plans would cost an extra \u00a33-5bn per year, on top of an extra \u00a35bn the Treasury would have to spend anyway due to England's aging population.\nUrging ministers to \"be generous,\" he said the overall cost was \"not huge\" compared to wider public spending, and would have a \"massive\" impact on individuals.\nUrging the PM to \"grasp the nettle,\" former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the initial costs of Dilnot-style changes would be \"easily manageable\".\nWriting in the Daily Mail, he said costs would only then increase after the \"immediate post-pandemic period\".\nLabour's shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall said the government should present its plans to Parliament \"as soon as possible\".\n\"We have been waiting almost two years to see the 'clear plan' for social care that [Mr Johnson] claimed to have prepared, and all we've heard about it is nine words in the Queen's Speech\", she added. \nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said the government would be \"bringing forward some good plans in due course\"."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

She was able to get her hands up and protect her face, but took the full force of it and suffered burns to her hands, feet and many other parts of her body.\"\nDescribing it as \"such a terrible incident\", he said that all family and friends were \"counting our blessings\" nobody was killed.\nBecause the house is on a hill, the living area was upstairs and three bedrooms on the ground floor, meaning Lauren was able to climb out of the rubble unhurt.\nHowever, Sharna, a student, was airlifted to hospital, and while she is now out of the high dependency unit, faces up to 10 more days in hospital.\nMr Speedy said she is \"positive\", \"staying the strong\" and has thanked those that have donated - including one person who gave \u00a31,000 - adding: \"Everyone is just so grateful how the community has come together to help.\"\nJessica and Lauren are now staying with Sharna's best friend since childhood Keira Hustings, who said: \"Sadly, the house was destroyed, along with all their possessions.\n\"They were literally left with only the clothes they were wearing.\"\nWhile many personal items lost were \"irreplaceable\", the money raised will help buy other essentials, with Ms Hustings adding: \"We are all thankful it wasn't so much worse, and for the wonderful emergency services who came to their rescue.\"\nIn five days, \u00a32,890 of the \u00a35,000 target had been reached and she said: \"I'm speechless and know that Sharna and the girls are too.\"\nAn investigation has been launched by police and Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service to discover the cause of the explosion."

      "text": "Israel's prime minister has called on the US and its allies to \"wake up\" to the threat of Iran as talks continue to revive a landmark deal to limit the country's nuclear programme.\nNaftali Bennett said Iran's \"regime of brutal hangmen\" wants nuclear weapons, something Iran has repeatedly denied.\nDiplomats said progress was made to renew the deal, which the US withdrew from under President Donald Trump, but there were still gaps to be bridged.\nIsrael opposes the agreement.\nIran elected hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, the country's top judge who holds ultra-conservative views, as new president on Friday, in a race widely seen as being designed to favour him.\nThe president-elect - who will be inaugurated in August - is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners.\nNegotiators from the six signatory countries - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - and Iran have been holding talks since April to revive the deal, which saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.\nIran, however, has been violating the deal since the US unilaterally left it.\nOn Sunday, the countries gathered for a sixth round of indirect talks between the US and Iran in Vienna, but adjourned for the delegates to return to their capitals.\nIranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told state television the parties were \"now closer than ever\" to a deal, but added that bridging the remaining distance between them was \"not an easy job\".\nEnrique Mora, envoy for the EU, echoed Mr Araqchi, saying progress on technical issues had given them greater clarity, giving them a \"clear idea of what the political problems are\".\nThe US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said there was \"still a fair distance to travel\" on issues including sanctions and on the commitments Iran needed to make. Iran is currently enriching uranium at its highest levels ever, although still short of what is needed to make nuclear-grade weapons.\nA spokesman for the US state department earlier said the indirect talks would still continue after Mr Raisi takes power.\nIran and Israel have been in a long-running \"shadow war\", which has resulted in both countries taking part in tit-for-tat actions, but so far avoiding all-out conflict. \nAyatollah Khamenei - Iran's supreme leader - has repeatedly called for the elimination of the state of Israel. In 2018, he described the country as a \"cancerous tumour\" that had to be removed from the region.\nIsrael sees Iran as a major threat and has repeatedly insisted that it wants to develop nuclear weapons. \nPrime Minister Bennett told his cabinet this was \"the last chance for world powers to wake up... and understand who they are doing business with\".\n\"A regime of brutal hangmen must never be allowed to have weapons of mass destruction.\"\nRecently the hostilities between the two countries have escalated again. Iran blames Israel for the murder of its top nuclear scientist last year and an attack on one of its uranium enrichment plants in April. "

      "tags": "Scottish government,Scotland Education,OECD,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "The Scottish Qualifications Authority is to be replaced as part of a \"substantial\" overhaul of education, following an independent review.\nThe government said changes would be made in response to the OECD's report on the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE).\nIt backed the curriculum as a whole but said there was too much focus on exams in later years of schooling.\nThe exams body is to be broken up and replaced, with pupils, parents and teachers to be consulted on changes.\nSchools agency Education Scotland is also to be shaken up, with responsibility for school inspections to be split off to a new independent system.\nEducation Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said there would be a \"period of change\" to \"improve, to achieve more and to deliver for Scotland's pupils\".\nBut opposition parties said the report was a \"damning judgement of Scotland's exams system\" and that reforms were \"long overdue\".\nThe independent report from the OECD - the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development - was commissioned by the Scottish government in 2019, but pushed back due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe pandemic has brought particular focus onto the school qualifications system, with criticism of how grades have been decided after formal exams were cancelled two years running.\nThe long-awaited review backed the curriculum as a whole, but said there was a \"misalignment\" between its aims and the narrow focus on exams in later years.\nIt said the \"visionary ideals\" of the curriculum - which was meant to be focused on producing more rounded individuals rather than teaching to tests - had not fully succeeded, with the qualifications system a \"barrier\" to its aims in secondary education.\nMs Somerville said the report was \"crystal clear that Curriculum for Excellence is the right approach for Scotland\" - but said it was \"right and proper that we review how it is being implemented\".\nShe said: \"We will replace the SQA. We will talk to young people, parents and teachers to build a system that works in line with CfE - exactly as the OECD recommends.\n\"Responsibility for inspection will no longer sit with Education Scotland and we will look at what further reform of the agency's functions is required.\n\"What comes next is a period of change. But it is change in order to improve, to achieve more and to deliver for Scotland's pupils. Our commitment is to do exactly that and we will work with everyone and anyone willing to help to make that a reality.\"\nSQA chief executive Fiona Robertson welcomed the OECD report, saying the creation of a \"new specialist agency\" would be \"an opportunity for significant change that will meet the future needs of our learners, our society and economy\".\nThis looks like swift action from the Scottish government, but it's worth pointing out they have seen versions of this report and will have known about its findings for many weeks.\nMinisters' full-bodied endorsement of the recommendations shows willingness and appetite for a shake-up of the system which has been stretched to its limits because of the pandemic.\nThis is all happening against a backdrop of criticism of the way the replacement system for exams has been handled this year, which has brought the debate to the front of the national conversation. \nWith formal tests now cancelled for two years in a row, could we have already seen the last diet of \"status quo\" examinations? \nThe government had previously said it would review the role of the SQA and Education Scotland, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also told MSPs she had full confidence in the exams body.\nMinisters said they would \"consult widely\" on what the new system will look like, with a second report from the OECD expected in the autumn and talks to be held with young people, parents and teachers.\nSome of the curriculum work currently undertaken by Education Scotland will be split off to the new assessment body, while its role in school inspections will also shift to a more independent system.\nOpposition parties - which united to pass a Holyrood motion demanding reforms in February - said change in education was long overdue.\nScottish Conservative education spokesman Oliver Mundell said the \"damning\" report \"exposes how badly the SNP government has failed Scotland's schools\".\nHe said: \"This report is the final nail in the SNP's flawed education system. They have now been forced into a massive top-to-bottom overhaul of their mistakes.\"\nScottish Labour's education spokesman Michael Marra said the system was \"in urgent need of reform and resources\".\nHe added: \"It is welcome that the SQA is to be scrapped and replaced by a new body. It has become increasingly clear that the organisation stood as a barrier to realising the full potential of Curriculum for Excellence.\"\nScottish Green MSP Ross Greer said the OECD report was a \"damning judgement of Scotland's exams system and the body which oversees it\", and warned that \"replacing failed agencies won't automatically solve this problem\".\nAnd Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the \"impenetrable bubble at the top of Scottish education\" may be set to burst, adding that a \"comprehensive package of bounce-back support for pupils\" was also needed.\nMs Somerville told BBC Scotland that she would \"challenge\" opposition parties to come up with ideas for the new-look education structures.\nShe added: \"Why don't we actually work together to start raising the debate on education, to see what we can develop within the parliament - but very importantly with young people and teachers about what they want to see.\"\nThe Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) was developed in the early 2000s and adopted across Scotland's schools from 2010/11.\nIn broad terms, it was a shift in focus away from the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake, with a greater emphasis being placed on how to use or apply knowledge.\nIts aim was to give pupils a \"holistic understanding\" that equipped them to be successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens, and effective contributors.\nHowever, the OECD said teaching methods became more \"traditional\" for pupils in secondary school, especially the senior phase, in order for them to pass exams.\nThe authors were told traditional teaching practices were seen as \"the most efficient way to help students obtain their qualifications\".\nThe OECD, an international organisation that works to build better policies, said Scotland was among the first education systems to embrace the 21st Century learning movement.\nThe report said the CfE offered \"an inspiring and widely supported philosophy of education\". However, it said adjustments might be needed in secondary school where the exams system was a significant barrier to its implementation.\nSenior phase students reported an emphasis on rote learning and memorisation, which they described as \"boring\".\nThe OECD said the \"backwash\" from this may even be felt in primary schools where concerns about readiness for subject choice and examination success were mentioned by parents of the youngest pupils.\nThe report said Scotland could identify ways of assessing pupils that could be used in senior phase, such as continuous assessment, which would be better suited to the aims of the CfE."

McDonald's said it pays everyone under 21 more than the national minimum wage, and everyone over 21 more than the national living wage (\u00a38.91 an hour).\nThe US is also seeing a staff shortage in some areas, and in May McDonald's said it would raise the hourly wages for its company-owned restaurants by an average of 10%.\nAs part of the expansion, McDonald's said it would add more restaurants \"in the regions\" of the UK, although a spokesperson did not expand on the details. \nDespite changing working patterns and debate over the future of the High Street, Mr Pomroy told the Telegraph that the High Street would continue \"to be part of the fabric of the UK\".\nHe said: \"It's up to us to make sure there are reasons for people to visit.\"\nIn addition to opening more outlets, McDonald's said it was introducing new menu options, including a Grab & Go set breakfast option.\nThe company also said in a statement it was \"trialling more flexible restaurant layouts to adapt to the different ways customers use its restaurants at different times of the day\", but gave no further details.\nItsu - which sells sushi, noodle soups and other Asian-inspired meals - is also expanding, with new backing from investment firm Bridgepoint.\nItsu's founder, Julian Metcalfe, said: \"We've spent months in lockdown working with [Bridgepoint] to ensure Itsu will be well-funded for long-term growth\".\nBridgepoint previously invested in Pret-a-Manger, another pre-packed lunch chain, founded by Mr Metcalfe in 1986, which they subsequently sold on.\nItsu said Bridgepoint had bought \"a meaningful minority stake\" in the group, which was recovering from the impact of lockdown measures.\n\"We are slowly getting back to pre-pandemic customer visits. Outside London, we are already busier than before,\" Mr Metcalfe said in a statement. \nBut he said the industry was facing \"the looming challenge of a severe shortage of young European chefs and huge food inflation\".\nBenoit Alteirac, partner at Bridgepoint, pointed to the focus on healthy food, in particular the high proportion of plant-based food on Itsu's menus, as one reason they were backing the company."

      "text": "A higher proportion of Wales' population has had a dose of a Covid vaccine than any other country with more than a million people.\nIt is quite the contrast with January, when questions were being asked about the sluggish start to vaccinations.\nPeople aged 30 and 31 in England are being invited to book to have their first dose of Covid vaccine, while in Wales more than half of 18 to 29-year-olds have had at least one dose of a vaccine.\nSo what explains the difference? \nAccording to Paul Mainwood, a strategy consultant, former academic and \"amateur vaccine sleuth\", Wales took a risk and that risk has paid off in a big way.\nIn some parts of Wales, more than two-thirds of people in the 18 to 29-year-old age group have been given a first dose, including Conwy county (72.1%).\nWales is also pushing on with its second doses and has set daily records over the past two days, including 20,715 second doses on Wednesday.\nA total of 2,120,049 people (67.2%) have now been given a first dose of a vaccine and 1,058,464 people (33.6%) have had a second jab, according to Public Health Wales (PHW) figures.\nAfter the slow start, Wales had caught up with England and Scotland by early February, and since 7 April it has been ahead of all the other UK nations.\nThe Welsh government expects all adults to have been offered a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine \"over the next couple of weeks\" - more than a month ahead of schedule.\nAlong with other UK nations, Wales had committed to offering a first dose to all over-18s by the end of July.\nWhile the UK government has arranged supplies of vaccine, the distribution programme in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh government and NHS Wales.\nA network of vaccination centres and GP surgeries have been giving the vaccine to people in Wales since December.\nWhile the Welsh government has not set a new date for when all adults will have been offered a first dose, a spokesperson confirmed the original target of 31 July would now be met in June.\nOne Welsh health board covering the capital city has already offered first vaccination appointments to all adults.\nCardiff and Vale University Health Board has begun offering walk-in appointments at the Bayside vaccination centre in Cardiff Bay.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's More or Less programme, Mr Mainwood said Wales uses more of its vaccine allocation and delivers them into people's arms within a couple of days.\nHe said this was in stark contrast to other UK nations, including Scotland, which takes between 10 and 12 days to deliver the vaccines to people.\nMr Mainwood said there were risks to \"running with a very low stock holding\", like Wales is doing.\nIf people have their first dose appointment cancelled, there is a chance they may not be \"found\" again. \"You really need to be as reliable as possible,\" he explained.\nAnd with second doses, it is important to have enough doses available when they become due. But the risk had \"so far paid off,\" Mr Mainwood said.\nThe \"separation of strategy\" between Wales and the rest of the UK came towards the end of February, when it began taking the vaccine allocation very quickly and started administering second doses, he explained.\nThis had the effect of \"building a bit of cover\" in terms of fully vaccinating the most vulnerable groups early, which allowed a quicker acceleration of the first dose roll out to the rest of the population.\nAnd another thing Wales is doing differently is to move through the age cohorts more quickly than other parts of the UK. In Scotland, Mr Mainwood said, there is a slower progression through the cohorts, but greater uptake than in Wales.\n\"Wales has raced down a bit and have much lower uptake percentage in those top ones, but are starting to do people in their 30s and their 20s now,\" he said.\nMr Mainwood added: \"There are lessons the rest of the country should be learning from Wales.\""

That's where I believe certainly the vast majority of people in the public are.\n\"There's no shopping list and there's certainly no Sinn F\u00e9in shopping list.\"\nHe said there was \"no basis to power-sharing unless people keep to their word\".\n\"Irish language rights will be delivered this mandate and that's because Sinn F\u00e9in went around the DUP. In 2017, when we said there would be no return to the status quo we meant what we said.\"\nDUP party officers have set a date of 26 June to elect a new leader, if there is more than one candidate.\nPotential new leaders must submit in writing their nomination, supported by a proposer and seconder, to DUP chairman Lord Morrow before noon on Tuesday.\nOnly MLAs and MPs are entitled to vote if there is a leadership contest.\nSir Jeffrey ran against Mr Poots for the party leadership a number of weeks ago and was defeated by just two votes.\nMr Poots took over in May amid internal tensions about the direction his leadership would take and the manner of the departure of his predecessor Arlene Foster.\nHe had nominated Paul Givan to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Michelle O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) deal that restored power sharing in January 2020.\nThe party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on NI Secretary Brandon Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster.\nMr Poots had said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. \nLast week, a deal was struck between the two parties and the secretary of state that would see Westminster legislate for Irish language commitments in October, if it had not happened at Stormont.\nDUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing concern about the deal and subsequently opposed the nomination of Mr Givan as first minister.\nMr Givan looks set to be the shortest serving leader to hold the post. He has been informed by DUP officers that he will have to step down when the new leader takes over.\nWhen he resigns, that will once more will see Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill removed as deputy first minister, as it is a joint office, and the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in will then again have seven days to fill the roles. \nThe Sunday Life has reported that Sir Jeffrey, if he becomes DUP leader, will not nominate a first minister unless there is \"significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws\".\nThe moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, The Reverend David Bruce, has urged politicians not to allow issues over the Irish language to derail devolution.\nHe told BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday Sequence programme last week had been a \"political soap opera with cliff hanger following cliff hanger\".\n\"If we find ourselves preoccupied with the fragility of the assembly, that means important work may not be done - such as addressing educational under-achievement, waiting lists in the NHS, youth and disability service funding and revitalising communities.\"\nHe added that the Irish language held \"no threat to me as a Presbyterian - quite the reverse in fact - within our tradition the Irish language has been important to us, indeed it has been said Presbyterians were part of the rescue of the Irish language in the 18th Century\".\n\"It is associated with nationalism, sometimes republicanism, and therefore is antithetic to unionism and I would say: 'Let's get past the symbolism.'\n\"It ought not to be a threat to our work or identity in my view since we are an all-Ireland church.\" "

      "tags": "Transgender people,New Zealand",
      "text": "New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard has become the first ever transgender athlete picked to compete at an Olympics, in a controversial decision.\nOfficials have selected her for the women's weightlifting team for Tokyo 2020, after qualifying requirements were recently modified.\nShe had competed in men's events before coming out as transgender in 2013.\nCritics say Hubbard has an unfair advantage, but others have argued for more inclusion at the Games.\n\"I am grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many New Zealanders,\" Hubbard said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Olympic Committee on Monday.\nShe will compete in the women's 87-kg weightlifting category.\nThe 43-year-old became eligible to compete at the Olympics when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2015 changed its rules allowing transgender athletes to compete as a woman if their testosterone levels are below a certain threshold. \nTestosterone is a hormone that increases muscle mass.\nWhile the athlete's testosterone levels are below that threshold, critics say her participation in the Olympics is still unfair for female-born athletes.\nThey have pointed to the biological advantages of those who have gone through puberty as males, such as increased bone and muscle density.\nLast month, Belgian weightlifter Anna Vanbellinghen, who is competing in the same category, said that if Hubbard were to compete in Tokyo it would be unfair for women and \"like a bad joke\".\nShe said that while she fully supported the transgender community, the principle of inclusion should not be \"at the expense of others\".\n\"Anyone that has trained weightlifting at a high level knows this to be true in their bones: this particular situation is unfair to the sport and to the athletes,\" she said in May. \"Life-changing opportunities are missed for some athletes - medals and Olympic qualifications - and we are powerless.\"\nSave Women's Sport Australasia, an advocacy group arguing against transgender athletes to compete in women's competitions has also criticised Hubbard's selection for the Tokyo Games. \n\"It is flawed policy from the IOC that has allowed the selection of a 43-year-old biological male who identifies as a woman to compete in the female category,\" the group said in a statement ahead of Monday's decision.\nBut New Zealand's government and the country's top sporting body have backed her inclusion for the upcoming Olympics.\n\"As well as being among the world's best for her event, Laurel has met the IWF eligibility criteria, including those based on IOC Consensus Statement guidelines for transgender athletes,\" New Zealand Olympic Committee chief executive Kereyn Smith said.\n\"We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play,\" he added. \n\"As the New Zealand team, we have a strong culture of 'manaaki' (respect) and inclusion and respect for all.\"\nThe head of Olympic Weightlifting New Zealand, Richie Patterson, said Hubbard had shown \"grit and perseverance\" to recover from a career-threatening 2018 injury. \n\"We look forward to supporting her in her final preparations towards Tokyo,\" he said.\nLaurel Hubbard is among the top ranked athletes in the world in her category.\nShe has a good chance at winning a medal, as several others won't compete due to rules by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) that that there should be only one lifter per category from each country. \nHubbard's participation in previous competitions had sparked controversy in the past. \nIn 2019 she won a gold medal at the Pacific Games in Samoa, beating an athlete from the host nation, which triggered outrage. \nSamoa's weightlifting boss has since said the New Zealander's selection for Tokyo was like allowing athletes to \"dope\" and feared it could again cost his country a medal.\nIn 2018, Australia's weightlifting federation tried to have Hubbard barred from the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. \nOrganisers rejected the move. But in the end Hubbard had to withdraw from the competition due to an injury. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nAmid the final push to get as many people over the age of 18 vaccinated before 19 July - England's anticipated date for lockdown easing - doctors and NHS trusts are already thinking about planning for coronavirus once the summer's over. \"We cannot carry on as we are, with an emergency response,\" they say, and the government must start planning for the autumn booster jab now. A senior government source says a plan for boosters will be published \"in due course\". \nThere's a new flexible season ticket if you travel by train two or three days a week. The move is part of the government's shake-up of rail services which comes into effect from 2023 - but as there's a trend for more home-working, accelerated by the pandemic, this part of the reform is being introduced from today. The new tickets can be used for eight days in a month and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says they will offer \"greater freedom and choice... simpler ticketing and a fairer fare\". While the changes will persuade some people to choose rail travel, the independent watchdog Transport Focus warns the new flexible tickets won't be the best option for everyone.\nA \"science superpower\" is what Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to see the UK become - following the success of the Covid vaccine rollout. He said the programme had proven what the UK could achieve at scale and speed, adding: \"With the right direction, pace and backing, we can breathe life into many more scientific and technological breakthroughs that transform the lives of people across the UK and the world.\" Mr Johnson announced how increases to the research budget would be spent and that he would chair a new National Science and Technology Council. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser to the government, will lead a new Office for Science and Technology Strategy.\nCovid capacity rules in music and comedy venues have been relaxed in another minor easing of Wales' lockdown restrictions. The changes mean groups of six people from six households can attend music and comedy venues, as they already can for pubs and restaurants. The number of guests attending wedding receptions and wakes also changed on Monday, allowing venues to host as many people as they can safely. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would pause major relaxations for four weeks due to the start of a third Covid wave.\nAs the vaccine rollout continues at pace, we've caught up with Margaret Keenan, 91, who received the world's first Covid jab.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs people queued at the weekend to get their jabs as part of a push to get all adults vaccinated by 19 July, do you know how soon can you have your second dose?\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Scottish Qualifications Authority to be scrapped after OECD review",
      "tags": "Scottish government,Scotland Education,OECD,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "The Scottish Qualifications Authority is to be replaced as part of a \"substantial\" overhaul of education, following an independent review.\nThe government said changes would be made in response to the OECD's report on the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE).\nIt backed the curriculum as a whole but said there was too much focus on exams in later years of schooling.\nThe exams body is to be broken up and replaced, with pupils, parents and teachers to be consulted on changes.\nSchools agency Education Scotland is also to be shaken up, with responsibility for school inspections to be split off to a new independent system.\nEducation Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said there would be a \"period of change\" to \"improve, to achieve more and to deliver for Scotland's pupils\".\nBut opposition parties said the report was a \"damning judgement of Scotland's exams system\" and that reforms were \"long overdue\".\nThe independent report from the OECD - the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development - was commissioned by the Scottish government in 2019, but pushed back due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe pandemic has brought particular focus onto the school qualifications system, with criticism of how grades have been decided after formal exams were cancelled two years running.\nThe long-awaited review backed the curriculum as a whole, but said there was a \"misalignment\" between its aims and the narrow focus on exams in later years.\nIt said the \"visionary ideals\" of the curriculum - which was meant to be focused on producing more rounded individuals rather than teaching to tests - had not fully succeeded, with the qualifications system a \"barrier\" to its aims in secondary education.\nMs Somerville said the report was \"crystal clear that Curriculum for Excellence is the right approach for Scotland\" - but said it was \"right and proper that we review how it is being implemented\".\nShe said: \"We will replace the SQA. We will talk to young people, parents and teachers to build a system that works in line with CfE - exactly as the OECD recommends.\n\"Responsibility for inspection will no longer sit with Education Scotland and we will look at what further reform of the agency's functions is required.\n\"What comes next is a period of change. But it is change in order to improve, to achieve more and to deliver for Scotland's pupils. Our commitment is to do exactly that and we will work with everyone and anyone willing to help to make that a reality.\"\nSQA chief executive Fiona Robertson welcomed the OECD report, saying the creation of a \"new specialist agency\" would be \"an opportunity for significant change that will meet the future needs of our learners, our society and economy\".\nThis looks like swift action from the Scottish government, but it's worth pointing out they have seen versions of this report and will have known about its findings for many weeks.\nMinisters' full-bodied endorsement of the recommendations shows willingness and appetite for a shake-up of the system which has been stretched to its limits because of the pandemic.\nThis is all happening against a backdrop of criticism of the way the replacement system for exams has been handled this year, which has brought the debate to the front of the national conversation. \nWith formal tests now cancelled for two years in a row, could we have already seen the last diet of \"status quo\" examinations? \nThe government had previously said it would review the role of the SQA and Education Scotland, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also told MSPs she had full confidence in the exams body.\nMinisters said they would \"consult widely\" on what the new system will look like, with a second report from the OECD expected in the autumn and talks to be held with young people, parents and teachers.\nSome of the curriculum work currently undertaken by Education Scotland will be split off to the new assessment body, while its role in school inspections will also shift to a more independent system.\nOpposition parties - which united to pass a Holyrood motion demanding reforms in February - said change in education was long overdue.\nScottish Conservative education spokesman Oliver Mundell said the \"damning\" report \"exposes how badly the SNP government has failed Scotland's schools\".\nHe said: \"This report is the final nail in the SNP's flawed education system. They have now been forced into a massive top-to-bottom overhaul of their mistakes.\"\nScottish Labour's education spokesman Michael Marra said the system was \"in urgent need of reform and resources\".\nHe added: \"It is welcome that the SQA is to be scrapped and replaced by a new body. It has become increasingly clear that the organisation stood as a barrier to realising the full potential of Curriculum for Excellence.\"\nScottish Green MSP Ross Greer said the OECD report was a \"damning judgement of Scotland's exams system and the body which oversees it\", and warned that \"replacing failed agencies won't automatically solve this problem\".\nAnd Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the \"impenetrable bubble at the top of Scottish education\" may be set to burst, adding that a \"comprehensive package of bounce-back support for pupils\" was also needed.\nMs Somerville told BBC Scotland that she would \"challenge\" opposition parties to come up with ideas for the new-look education structures.\nShe added: \"Why don't we actually work together to start raising the debate on education, to see what we can develop within the parliament - but very importantly with young people and teachers about what they want to see.\"\nThe Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) was developed in the early 2000s and adopted across Scotland's schools from 2010/11.\nIn broad terms, it was a shift in focus away from the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake, with a greater emphasis being placed on how to use or apply knowledge.\nIts aim was to give pupils a \"holistic understanding\" that equipped them to be successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens, and effective contributors.\nHowever, the OECD said teaching methods became more \"traditional\" for pupils in secondary school, especially the senior phase, in order for them to pass exams.\nThe authors were told traditional teaching practices were seen as \"the most efficient way to help students obtain their qualifications\".\nThe OECD, an international organisation that works to build better policies, said Scotland was among the first education systems to embrace the 21st Century learning movement.\nThe report said the CfE offered \"an inspiring and widely supported philosophy of education\". However, it said adjustments might be needed in secondary school where the exams system was a significant barrier to its implementation.\nSenior phase students reported an emphasis on rote learning and memorisation, which they described as \"boring\".\nThe OECD said the \"backwash\" from this may even be felt in primary schools where concerns about readiness for subject choice and examination success were mentioned by parents of the youngest pupils.\nThe report said Scotland could identify ways of assessing pupils that could be used in senior phase, such as continuous assessment, which would be better suited to the aims of the CfE."

      "tags": "France,Emmanuel Macron,Marine Le Pen",
      "text": "Early results indicate both President Emmanuel Macron and his opponent Marine Le Pen will fail to make the gains they were hoping for in the first round of regional elections in France. \nMr Macron's centrist party is projected to gain more than 10% of the vote - just enough to take part in the second round next weekend.\nMs Le Pen's far-right National Rally has also fallen short of expectations. \nBoth are trailing the conservative party, Les R\u00e9publicains.\nOne of Mr Macron's MPs, Aurore Berg\u00e9, described her party's poor performance as a \"democratic slap in the face for all of us\".\nMs Le Pen's National Rally party was expected to top Sunday's first round of polling, and win at least one region for the first time. Instead it is now predicted to come second.\nMs Le Pen is not running as a candidate but she has been leading the campaign. \nShe described the record-low voter turnout - a projected 66% abstention - as a \"civic disaster\".\nShe blamed the results on the government's inability to inspire faith in political institutions. \"Let's face it, the results were marked by a torrential and also historic abstention of nearly 70% due to the mistrust of an electoral system, which leaves voters with the feeling that nothing can change, that everything has been confiscated,\" she said. \nVoters are choosing new councils for France's 12 mainland regions, the island of Corsica, plus four overseas, as well as 96 departments. There are more than 15,700 candidates standing for 4,100 seats.\nThis election is being watched particularly closely, because the next presidential elections are less than a year away. It is being used to get a taste of voters' mood.\nAn Ipsos exit poll shows the conservative Les R\u00e9publicains winning 27% of the vote, followed by National Rally with 19%. The Greens, the Socialist Party and Mr Macron's La R\u00e9publique En Marche (LREM) are all on 11%.\nThis is the first time President Macron's party has taken part in regional elections - La R\u00e9publique en Marche did not exist the last time they were held in 2015.\nHis party was not expected to do particularly well in this election. Last month a minister told AFP news agency: \"These elections are never good for the party in power. You always get it in the neck.\" \nYet LREM has still fared worse than expected. It will not win any region outright, a sign the party has failed to build support at local level. \nThe regional election was delayed for three months because of the pandemic. There will be a second-round run-off on 27 June.\nThe editorialists are having a problem this morning deciding what was the story of the night. Was it disappointment for Marine? Was it Macron's failure? Was it centre-right poised for presidential challenge? Was it Socialists and Greens show left-wing vote still strong?\nOr was it: crisis in French democracy. Only one in three bother to vote.\nAll of the above are plausible headlines. Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen have little to smile about, while Les R\u00e9publicains (the old Gaullists) see in the successes of Xavier Bertrand in the north and Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse in the Paris region signs that one or other will be a serious presidential challenger. The left can say (once again): if only we could unite we might actually count for something. \nTruth be told, though, the astronomic level of abstention means you can argue everything and its opposite about the vote. Because to every apparent lesson comes the rejoinder: yes, but what about the views of the majority? The ones who didn't turn out. "

      "text": "Hundreds of people attended the summer solstice at Stonehenge despite official advice asking them not to travel to the site in line with Covid restrictions.  \nAs a result English Heritage pulled a live feed of the sunrise at the neolithic monument in Wiltshire at 04:52 BST due to safety concerns. \nPeople were seen climbing over a low fence to access the stones.\nWiltshire Police said the event was peaceful but added the number of people at nearby Avebury had caused issues.\nMore than 200,000 people from around the world tuned in to the live stream for the solstice but ended up watching pre-recorded footage of the stones until the feed returned at around 05:00 BST, showing largely cloudy skies. \nVideo from the scene showed about a hundred people inside the stone circle and a banner reading \"Standing for Stonehenge\".\nEnglish Heritage had been preparing to welcome visitors in person until the government delayed the easing of covid restrictions into July.\nIt said the \"difficult decision\" to cancel planned celebrations was made following discussions with Wiltshire Council and Wiltshire Police. \nIt meant the organisation held a virtual event for the second consecutive year.\nApologising for the live stream outage, host Ed Shires said: \"We have been disappointed that a number of people have chosen to disregard our request to not travel to the stones this morning and that is the reason why we haven't been able to bring you the pictures that we would have liked to have done.\n\"It is disappointing to see that happen but unfortunately in those kind of situations we have to put the safety of our staff members first and that's why we have had some interruption this morning.\"\nA spokeswoman for English Heritage added: \"The Covid-19 restrictions were extended for a reason and it was disappointing to see, during a pandemic, people act in a way that put themselves, our staff and the police at risk.\" \nIt is the longest day of the year, with the most hours of sunlight. The word solstice comes from the fact the sun appears to stand still - from the Latin words sol (sun) and sistere (to stand still).\nThe summer solstice always occurs between the 20th and 22nd June in the northern hemisphere, and during a leap year it always falls on the 20th. \nThis is because the calendar year does not match exactly the time it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun - the calendar is approximately a quarter of a day short, which is why we have leap years, to bring the calendar back in line with the Earth's orbit. \nWhile the summer solstice is the day that has the most hours of sunlight, it can signal warmer weather is on the horizon because the UK's weather typically becomes hotter during July and August. \nEnglish Heritage did not elaborate on how the attendance of people at the site prevented them from showing a live feed of the sunrise.\nNormally, more than 10,000 people would gather to watch the sun rise over the stones on the longest day of the year.\nAt nearby Avebury stone circle, about 24 miles (38km) from Stonehenge, police closed off an area near to the site when crowds began gathering on Sunday evening.\nSupt Dave Minty, from Wiltshire Police, said: \"Most people have been well behaved. \n\"We have seen some build up in some areas around Avebury in particular, that we would have hoped to have avoided, but everything has been peaceful.\n\"It is just the numbers that have caused us some issues up on the Ridgeway.\" \nHe said a woman was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and had since been released.\nSenior druid King Arthur Pendragon said it was unnecessary to completely close the sites.\n\"It was never going to be massive anyway,\" he said.\n\"If you think about it a lot of the people who come to the solstice fly in from America, and all around the world, that wasn't going to happen this year, so I don't know why they didn't just let us in. \n\"I'd rather have been in there... but as it goes we did what we could.\" \nHundreds of cones had been placed on the roads closest to Stonehenge to prevent parking, but cars and vans were still squeezed into the few available slots. \nAt about 04:50 BST about 200 to 300 people had stepped over the low fence to be among the stones as the sun rose behind a bank of grey cloud.\nIt may have been the summer solstice, but it was as cold a morning as I can remember this year, there was a real chill in the air.\nI drove the short distance to the Avebury stones where a couple of hundred people - many who had camped out or slept in their vehicles overnight - also ignored the pleas from the authorities not to move among the monuments.\nIt all seemed very good-natured, with the security guards and police at both sites fairly relaxed.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result.\nEach UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: \nWhen people test positive for coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include:\nIf you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms.\nScotland\nFrom 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. \nInstead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test.\nEngland\nFrom 16 August, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advised to take one PCR test as soon as possible. \nAs long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action.\nWales\nSimilar changes will happen in Wales from 7 August. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not.\nNorthern Ireland\nMinisters in Northern Ireland are expected to discuss changes on 12 August. \nAny adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts.\nAnyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. \nThe NHS Covid app is available to download in England and Wales. \nIf you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid. \nYou need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. \nNorthern Ireland and Scotland have separate apps. \nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nGovernment ministers have said it is \"crucial\"  that people self-isolate when sent an alert.\nHowever, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led to many users deleting the app.\nCurrently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time.\nHowever, the app will soon only alert close contacts from the previous two days before the positive test.\nThe sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate.\nIn the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before.\nIn England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated. Sectors include energy and emergency services.\nSupermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status.\nA similar system is being launched in Scotland.\nA \u00a3500 grant is available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, many applications have been turned down.\nIn Scotland people can apply for the Self-Isolation Support Grant, worth \u00a3500, and there is a similar scheme in Wales. In Northern Ireland a discretionary payment is available.\nYou may also be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth \u00a396.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme."

      "text": "School inspections are to stay suspended until 2022, the Welsh government has announced.\nSchools will also not be subject to the traffic light system for rating schools for the next academic year, as part of moves to ease pressures on teachers.\nBoth were suspended in 2020 because of the Covid pandemic.\nTeaching unions welcomed the decision, saying it would have been a mistake if inspections had resumed in September.\nThe Conservatives said schools had to have \"some form of scrutiny\", while Plaid Cymru said more investment was needed to ensure children were not left behind.\nEducation minister Jeremy Miles said schools wanted to help pupils progress \"but there are pressures that are affecting their ability to do this\".\n\"I have listened and am taking action to support them,\" he added.\nMeasures requiring schools to report on metrics such as attainment and attendance are also being relaxed, with less data on school performance published. \nThere had been plans for inspections to resume this September, and there were calls for a delay so schools could focus on catch-up work.\nPilot inspections will take place in the spring term, but otherwise inspections will not happen before Easter 2022.\nThe Welsh government said Wales' inspection body Estyn will \"pilot a new approach to inspections with schools' agreement in the spring term\".\nLaura Doel, of headteachers' union NAHT, welcomed the announcement.\n\"Schools in Wales were promised an inspection-free year to allow them to concentrate on new curriculum development,\" she said.\n\"For inspections to resume in September would have been a mistake and a distraction to the priority of Covid-19 recovery in schools.\"\nThe NEU teaching union said its members would be \"heartened\" by the decision - but also called for the new curriculum to be delayed to 2022.\n\"Although our members do welcome the new curriculum in principle, we need time to get this right,\" David Evans, the union's Wales secretary, said.\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said there still needed to be \"some form of scrutiny of attainment levels, just so we have a clearer picture as to how much the pandemic has impacted on learners, which is an important tool in forming future policy decisions\". \n\"Potentially there are going to be underperforming schools going under the radar due to the suspension of inspections,\" she said. \n\"I understand the need to help manage teachers' workload, but parents do need reassurances that schools are doing all they can to support pupils.\"\nPlaid's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: \"The suspension of Estyn inspections and other measures announced is a welcome move but further details of the education minister's wider priorities need clarification.\n\"The Welsh government's spending on targeted support for pupils has been far lower than in other countries across the UK, and so more measures and more investment is needed to ensure a whole generation of children aren't left behind as a result of the pandemic,\" she said."

      "tags": "Poverty,Schools,Robert Halfon,Working class,Race and ethnicity",
      "text": "White working class pupils have been failed by decades of neglect in England's education system, a report by MPs says. \nThe Education Select Committee accused the government of a lack of targeted support for disadvantaged white pupils.\nIt says use of the term \"white privilege\", suggesting white pupils are at an advantage, is the \"opposite\" of the reality for poor white pupils.\nThe government says it is committed to making sure no child is left behind.\nThe report warns that white pupils on free school meals underachieve from early years in school through to GCSE, A-levels and university entry, compared with pupils on free meals from other ethnic groups.\nCommittee chairman Robert Halfon said it was a \"major social injustice\" that so little had been done to address this gap in attainment - and accused the government of \"muddled thinking\" in suggesting it could be explained by poverty.\n\"If you think it's about poverty, then it doesn't explain why most other ethnic groups do much better,\" he said.\nPoorer white pupils are falling behind \"every step of the way\", he warned, and with almost a million young people being affected, it could not be \"swept under the carpet\".\nMr Halfon warned against using the term \"white privilege\" in education, saying it was divisive and likely to \"promote disharmony\" and \"pits one group against another\". \nThe committee described white privilege, which has been used in a wider social context, as the idea of \"societal privilege that benefits white people over other ethnic groups\".\nThe committee said that in education \"privilege is the very opposite to what disadvantaged white children\" experience - and questioned whether under equality legislation schools should use that terminology.\nBut a Labour MP on the committee, Kim Johnson, rejected the reference to white privilege as a red herring which was trying to \"stoke the culture war\" and avoid scrutiny of the \"lack of investment\" in schools and local communities.\nThe report highlighted a mix of challenges about the local areas where many poor white pupils lived - and also \"cultural factors\" that could limit how much support they got from their families.\nThese underlying social problems included:\nIn response, the committee proposed more targeted funding and making the education system feel more relevant for these communities.\n\"There's this nagging feeling that it's not for me,\" says 18-year-old Oliver Jones-Lyons, describing the \"suspicions\" about the value of education that he thinks hold back some white working class communities.\nHe has been a pupil on free meals at a school near Newcastle and says there is still a concern about the education system harbouring snobbery and class prejudice, even down to stereotypes about regional accents which \"mark you out as different\".\nThere's an inclination to turn away from exams and instead say \"my dad can get us a job\".\n\"There's a lack of explanation of how education is helping you,\" Oliver says.\nBut he argues \"the biggest barriers to education are outside education\" - in places with limited job opportunities, bad housing, poor public transport and families not able to support their children in school.\nAnd he says that while he describes himself as a \"white working class boy\" he doesn't like the way that the label is being used to \"create more stereotypes\".\n\"It shouldn't be about putting people against each other\" or about \"culture wars\", he says, and rejects the white working class identity being caricatured as being bigoted or narrow minded.\nA better description would be people \"more likely to undersell ourselves\" and to dislike showing off, says Oliver.\nBut his own ambition has been supported by working with the Social Mobility Foundation charity - and he is waiting to see if he gets the A-levels grades needed to get into Oxford University next year. \nThe underachievement is down to a \"poisonous mix of place, family and local culture\", said Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, a regional network of head teachers in one of the areas with the biggest concentrations of disadvantaged white pupils.\nHe said it meant tackling the consequences of \"long-term deprivation\", where there might be fifth and sixth generations of workless families.\n\"Schools can't do it alone,\" he said, warning that already the pandemic had seen schools having to cope with feeding and clothing pupils.\n\"We need a cross-party sense of urgency about solving these problems,\" he said.\nMr Zarraga backed the targeted use of pupil premium funding and called for better ways of retaining teaching staff in the most challenging areas.\nThe report argues that vocational routes in education need to be clearly available - showing the connection between qualifications and work.\nThis chimes with the concerns of Kerry, a mother in Mansfield who is thinking about what jobs will be available for her sons, Bailey and Finley, in the years ahead.\nHer own parents stepped from school into factory work, which she says offered secure jobs.\nThe current world of employment seems more precarious, she says.\n\"I don't see good jobs arising, I don't think there's much opportunity out there,\" says Kerry. \"I want them to go to college, then get apprenticeships.\"\nThe aim is \"guaranteed work\" and she is worried about the cost of university. \"As a parent, I wouldn't be able to fund them to go,\" Kerry adds.\nWithout tackling the underachievement of white working class pupils the wider aim of narrowing the attainment gap between rich and poor will fail, warned former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw\n\"Two thirds of children on free school meals live in these communities. We will never reduce educational inequality unless we urgently address this longstanding issue,\" he said.\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the MPs' report showed the Conservative Party has \"turned its back on these pupils who need most support, from knowingly underfunded free childcare places in early years to cutting the pupil premium\".\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"This government is focused on levelling up opportunity so that no young person is left behind.\n\"That's why we are providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade,\" added the DfE spokesman, with \u00a33bn in recovery funding and existing plans to increase school budgets.\n\"The pupil premium is expected to increase to more than \u00a32.5bn this year, through which schools can support pupils with extra teaching, academic support or activities like breakfast clubs or educational trips.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,NHS England,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Plans for a Covid booster jab programme in the autumn will be set out in the next few weeks, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe health secretary said ministers were waiting for results from trials of different combinations of vaccines.\nIt comes after doctors and NHS trusts said planning for a booster rollout must start now as it will involve bigger challenges. \nThey said many questions needed answering, including how long immunity from the original Covid jab lasts.\nThe issue of whether children will be vaccinated also still remains, health leaders said. \n\"We are currently trialling which combinations of jabs are the most effective,\" Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast. \n\"In the next few weeks, when we get the clinical data through on what's the most effective combinations to have\u2026 then we'll set out all the details for the booster programme for the autumn.\"\nAmong the ongoing trials is the UK's Cov-Boost trial, which is testing different combinations of third doses.  \nA senior government source said the UK would also benefit from new vaccines from Novavax and Valneva, which are awaiting approval from the UK's medicines regulator. \nSo far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two jabs of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose.\nPeople have been rushing to get their vaccines in recent days, with more than one million jabs booked on Friday and Saturday in England after vaccinations opened to all over-18s.\nMinisters have repeatedly said that vaccination is the way out of lockdown, and the delay to England's lockdown ending from 21 June until 19 July was partly to allow more people to get vaccinated.\nSome restrictions have been eased on Monday though, the original date for lockdown ending - and what some had dubbed Freedom Day. \nThe number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue.\nAnd in Wales, rules are also being lifted slightly, including Covid capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.\nIn Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotland are expected to be extended until mid-July. \nThe average number of daily confirmed cases of coronavirus is now rising in the UK, with a further 9,284 announced by the government on Sunday. A further six deaths were announced.\nOn Monday, Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals and trusts in England, and Royal College of GPs chairman Martin Marshall said the 19 July target to offer a first dose to all adults was \"not so much a finishing line as a staging post\".\nThe government has previously promised there will be a booster programme for the Covid jab - but the health leaders said the prospect of a yearly Covid vaccine would bring \"arguably greater challenges\", and it was important to know:\nThey also said combining the Covid and flu vaccine rollouts - for example a Covid jab in one arm and a flu jab in the other - needed to be explored, but that would make the rollout more complex.\nAnd they said there needed to be investment in proper vaccination venues rather than relying on sports stadiums or community facilities.\n\"Since flu jabs start in September we need ministers and the JCVI - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - to really answer those questions as quickly as possible, so we're ready to administer the jabs we need to in the autumn,\" Mr Hopson told the BBC.\nMr Hopson and Mr Marshall said there needed to be a sustainable approach to vaccination, which meant the NHS could carry on vaccinating while also doing its other work.\n\"We cannot just carry on as we are, with an emergency response largely delivered by an overstretched workforce,\" they said.\nThey are asking questions rather than coming up with solutions but health leaders have identified a major challenge for the coming winter. \nOffering a first dose to all adults by 19 July is seen as just a first step in a long haul with Covid. \nGiven that booster vaccines will be needed, GPs and NHS trusts want to know the logistics of what will be a complex process on top of the usual winter pressures and dealing with the backlog of non-urgent work. \nDoctors and their practice teams have gone the extra mile to help deliver the Covid vaccination programme but they want to ensure day-to-day patient care is not compromised. \nThe flu season might seem some way off but the normal vaccination campaigns and rollout start in September each year.  \nHence the call for ministers to come with some answers and longer term plans soon. \nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, which advises UK health departments on vaccination, said decisions on booster jabs would be \"based on the best available evidence\" but the committee was also conscious of the need for the programme to be planned by the NHS.  \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme data on how flu and Covid vaccines could react to each other if given together would be available \"very soon\". \nProf Harnden added that flu could be \"potentially a bigger problem\" than Covid this winter because of the low prevalence in the last few years, particularly during lockdown, meaning the level of immunity in the population had dropped. \nOn whether under-18s could be offered a Covid vaccine, he said \"we need to think very carefully what the benefits are to children themselves\", and the JCVI would be considering this in the next few weeks. \nThe committee has not yet made a formal recommendation on the matter.\nThe World Health Organization has previously urged rich countries like the UK to donate doses to poorer countries before organising booster jabs."

      "tags": "Open water swimming",
      "text": "Four open-water swimmers from County Down have become the first all-female relay team to swim a treacherous stretch of water between Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThe D\u00e1l Riata Channel - between the Mull of Kintyre and the County Antrim coastline - covers a distance of 10.5 miles (17km).\nHowever, due to strong currents, the actual swimming distance was 21.9 miles (35.3km).\nJane Reilly, Grace McLaughlin, Gillian Segasby and Nuala Glynn completed the swim in just over eight hours.\nThe relay team made a first attempt in the early hours of Saturday, but dangerously strong currents resulted in the plans being abandoned at the last minute. \n\"When we got to the Mull of Kintyre, the tides were just too strong,\" Jane Reilly told BBC News NI.\n\"We were up all night waiting to start the swim and then it was so disappointing when it had to be called off. \n\"We went back to Ballycastle and, thankfully, the night manager at the Marine Hotel allowed us to lie down on their sofas for a couple of hours. Then at 6am we left and headed back over to Scotland to start again.\"\nJane, who has previously swum the North Channel between Donaghadee and Portpatrick, explained that D\u00e1l Riata was more of a challenge as it has stronger tides and colder water.\n\"It's 17km in a straight line, but because of the currents, you have to swim in a curve so it was actually just over 35km. It can be treacherous,\" she said. \nThe swim began shortly after 10:00 BST, when the tides were safer and the water temperature was 11\u00b0C.  \n\"That's classed as cold, but maybe because we'd been swimming through the winter, it didn't feel too bad,\" said Jane. \n\"Grace was the first in the water. It was just beautiful pulling away from Scotland, seeing the cliffs, looking up at the isle of Jura, seals going in and out of the water, gannets, at one point there was a whale breaching. \n\"It was actually quite emotional.\" \nEach team member swam twice over eight hours and seven minutes, hitting up to 70 strokes per minute at top speed. \nThe relay team was guided by pilots and cheered on by crew and family on the boat, but in the last quarter of the swim, doubts began to emerge over whether or not they would reach land. \n\"If you don't make it within seven or eight hours, you won't make it at all because then the tide turns. So it was a nervous last leg and so amazing to see Grace finally touch land just north of Cushendun. \n\"She took over from me for the final eight minutes and even as she got in the tide was turning and those were a difficult eight minutes for her.\" \nProfessional swimmer Mercedes Gleitze made a failed attempt to cross the D\u00e1l Riata Channel in 1928. \nThe first successful attempt was by South African Wayne Soutter in 2012 - he completed the swim in 12 hours, 11 minutes. \nThe relay team who completed it on Saturday have been training in open water off the Bangor coastline for more than a year, but former water polo player Jane is the only member who had crossed a channel before. \n\"We were in Bangor Swimming Club before that, Gillian was in Ards Swimming Club, but then lockdown happened and we couldn't go to the pool so we started swimming in the sea,\" said Jane.\n\"And all through the winter, we pushed ourselves to do longer and longer swims.\n\"It's good for your mental health as well as the physical health, that bond you develop is great.\"\nJacqueline McClelland of Infinity Channel Swimming, which orchestrated the swim, described it as \"a huge achievement\".\n\"Their endurance was quite amazing given all the resistance they had from the huge tidal swells,\" she said.\n\"There was exhaustion, there was hypothermia, but they just kept on going, there was such a strength of spirit there and each one just swam their hearts out.\n\"There have been numerous failed attempts to cross this perilous stretch of water, so to watch Grace touching land was a fantastic moment.\" "

      "text": "John-Russell Barnes has three part-time jobs to help support his mother and sisters. But that's not what makes the 18-year-old from Hastings unusual.\nHe's a white working-class boy who is going to university.\nMore than half a million new students will be heading off to start at universities across the UK this term, with record numbers set to enter despite all the Covid complications.\nBut white males from low-income families are the \"least likely\" group to be going, according to the most recent figures from the Department for Education.\nAmong state school youngsters not on free school meals, 45% go on to higher education by the age of 19. Those more disadvantaged students, eligible for free school meals, have a lower entry rate of 26%.\nBut for \"male, white British, free school meals\" pupils, the figure is 13% - even lower than the year before, and to put it in context, it's below \"looked after\" children who have been in council care and far below those speaking English as a second language. \nThis figure of 13% is stuck in another era compared with the success stories of other groups, such as black students, with 59% progressing to higher education, and 64% of Asian students.\nFor sixth formers in independent schools, 85% make the step forward into higher education.\nThe gap is so wide that the chairman of the House of Commons education select committee, Robert Halfon, says there has almost been a \"taboo\" talking about it.\nBut why are young white males from poorer backgrounds so less likely to go to university? \n\"At the beginning of college a lot of my mates were saying they were going to go to university - and then at the end, they're like 'maybe not,'\" says John-Russell Barnes.\n \"People started to drift off on to different paths.\"\nThat might be a positive alternative, such as an apprenticeship or a good job - but it might also be insecure, temporary work they can pick up in the East Sussex seaside town.\nHe thinks boys are particularly susceptible to short-term incentives, taking the quick cash available and putting off going to university in a way that means it will never really happen.\n\"Whereas I feel girls are probably more mature. They're prepared to just go to uni and not worry about it, whereas men are: 'Oh, you know, I'll see how I am in a couple of years and then maybe I'll go.' And they don't end up going.\"\nAnd in practice it's often easier for men to get better-paid casual labour than women, he says.\nJohn-Russell's own focus has been on studying law, the subject he's going to take at Swansea University after getting the A-level grades he needed at a further education college. He wants it to be a different future from his round of temporary jobs in a bakery, corner shop and pub.\n\"I've always been quite set on it,\" he says, and he's been supported by the Villiers Park trust, a charity which works with bright disadvantaged youngsters trying to get into university.\nHe's been on projects run by Villiers Park, which provide information, advice and opportunities to meet other young people who are thinking about going to university. And for John-Russell, the biggest deciding factor has been seeing university as the route for his ambition to become a lawyer.\nFor those of his friends not going to university, he says it's not necessarily the tuition fees that are the main deterrent, but the lack of certainty about getting a career to make the expense worthwhile.\nThere's also the \"fear of the unknown\", he says, that it's \"intimidating\" to move into something very different and away from home and family, with no guarantee of a good job at the end.\n\"Personally I don't really like change that much. It's like going to a restaurant - I always order the same sort of things, rather than trying something new,\" he says. \nIt's a big step for him - but he's confident that it's the right decision.\nBut why has this group been so often left behind while others have taken big strides in getting into higher education?\nThere is nothing inevitable about deprivation being a barrier. Inner London is the most stellar illustration of this, with 49% of pupils on free meals going on to higher education - and overall numbers of disadvantaged students have been rising.\nWomen have continued to get more places and accelerated further ahead of men - and boys from middle-class families are able to stay on the conveyor belt that takes them seamlessly from school to university.\nAnd the biggest single increase in university entry over the past decade has been among black youngsters, with black African families doing particularly well. For boys on free school meals from black African families, 52% progress to higher education, compared with 24% for black Caribbean boys on free school meals.\nAnne-Marie Canning, chief executive of the Brilliant Club, which campaigns to widen access to university, says there remains a \"real issue\" about the lack of a similar breakthrough for white working-class boys.\n\"We need to be more mature about what diversity means,\" says Ms Canning, a former director of social mobility at King's College London.\nShe says too often projects to engage this demographic have reverted to stereotypes - with links to things like boxing or other sports  which from the outside might seem gritty and male, but which in practice fail to land a punch.\nThere are much deeper issues at play with young white males from \"post-industrial towns\", she suggests.\nThese are places where the confidence, status and identity of communities have been badly dented by changes in jobs and the economy.\nShe points to the \"collapse of local institutions\" - whether it's social clubs, work-based societies, church groups, adult education or trade union organisations, which might once have raised horizons.\n\"Parental attitudes really matter,\" she says - and too often such disadvantaged youngsters thinking about applying to university can suffer badly from \"imposter syndrome\".\nThere is a strong overlapping regional dimension. The areas of England with a high concentration of white disadvantaged youngsters, such as the north-east, east, south-west and coastal towns, are also where university entry rates are lower.\nSir David Bell, vice chancellor of the University of Sunderland, says universities need to think more about how to present courses to their local community - such as showing clear links into employment and appealing to students who want to carry on living at home.\n\"Social mobility too often is thought of as a relatively small number going away to study and never coming back,\" said Sir David, a former head of Ofsted.\nThere have been arguments from the government against getting 50% of young people into university - but in the north-east, where the entry rate for those on free school meals is 21% - he sees this as missing the point.\n\"It's a nice argument to have in the salons of London that too many people are going to university,\" said Sir David.\nBut what's being done to close the gap?\nGraeme Atherton, director of the National Education Opportunities Network, produced research last year revealing that more than half of England's universities had fewer than 5% of poor white students in their intakes.\nInstead of this being a call to arms, he says there has been a \"perfect storm of inaction\".\nHe has carried out research, so far unpublished, which will show that the numbers of universities with targets for disadvantaged white students are going down rather than up - from 27 institutions to four.\nUniversities find this a \"difficult conversation\", he says, and without pressure from policymakers, it's one they often seem to prefer to leave alone.\nThe low entry rate is in some ways easy to explain. Boys get worse exam results than girls, white students are among the lowest achievers and poor pupils tend to do worse than the wealthy.\nWhen those factors are combined, white boys from low-income families have among the lowest exam results and are the least well-equipped to get university places.\nBut Dr Atherton says there are other dimensions.\n\"We use the term social mobility, but it also means you're leaving something behind, physically and culturally,\" he says.\nGoing away to university is a big social departure - and if the rest of the family are ambivalent about its benefits and didn't go themselves, the idea can soon be abandoned.\nEven in terms of qualifications, this group can be facing an uphill struggle. They are disproportionately more likely to be taking BTecs rather than the A-levels that will be the more typical path into higher-ranking universities.\nOnly 2% of white working class boys get into more selective, \"high tariff\" universities.\nMPs warned that delays in BTec grades this summer could have caused even more disruption for students wanting to use the results for university places.\nMary Curnock Cook was previously in charge of Ucas, the admissions system for universities, and she says there has been a reluctance to engage with this issue - which gets left in the \"too difficult to handle box\".\nBut she says it's a \"double discrimination\" if disadvantaged white males not only are under-represented in university, but then have the problem ignored.\nRobert Halfon, whose select committee is investigating the achievement gap for these \"left behind\" young people, says it's important that it's no longer \"swept under the carpet\"."

      "text": "Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has confirmed his candidacy for the leadership of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nIn May, the Lagan Valley MP was defeated by Edwin Poots, who is to resign following internal divisions.\nSir Jeffrey has previously said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister if he became leader.\nHe warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive would be at risk if the UK government fails to take \"decisive action\" over the protocol. \nNominations for the leadership will close at midday on Tuesday but Sir Jeffrey is likely to take the top job unopposed.\n\"Now, more than ever, we need to unite in the face of the threats posed to Northern Ireland by the protocol,\" he said in a statement.\n\"Make no mistake, this is the number one issue facing our country, our people and our place within the United Kingdom.\n\"If elected, I will ensure that the government doesn't just listen, but recognises the need to take decisive action to deal quickly with the protocol.\n\"A failure to act will undoubtedly have consequences for the stability of our political institutions and the prosperity of our economy.\"\nThe decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a revolt over his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister.\nMr Givan became first minister on Thursday, however, has since been told by DUP officers that he must resign from the post when a new party leader takes over.\nAs it stands, it very much feels like this is going to be a one-horse race. \nCome 12:00 BST on Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is expected to be declared the leader-designate of the DUP. \nThen we're expecting a ratification process which we understand will happen at some stage next week. \nSir Jeffrey, if he does indeed become the next DUP leader, has to find a pathway back to Stormont. He has made it clear he wants to lead the party here as first minister. \nTo do that, he has to find a seat and get himself co-opted. \nThe number one priority for Sir Jeffrey is to get back among the MLAs at Stormont. \nSinn F\u00e9in had refused to nominate a deputy first minister to the joint office unless there was a commitment to implement the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, which contained provisions for the Irish language. \nThe UK government said it would introduce legislation in October if the assembly had failed to do so.\nSir Jeffrey has previously said he will not nominate a first minister unless there is \"significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws\".\nHe has also expressed opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI aligned to the EU single market, but has caused disruption in trade with Great Britain.\nEarlier, outgoing First Minister Paul Givan said Sir Jeffrey would have his \"full support\" should he decide to run for leader of the DUP.\n\"Jeffrey is a formidable politician, one that has a lot to offer Northern Ireland,\" said Mr Givan.\n\"I have spoken to Jeffrey Donaldson over the weekend, I have encouraged him to put his name forward, if he does, he'll have my full support.\"\nMr Givan was speaking following his first official event in Belfast since becoming first minister last week.\nHe described Sir Jeffrey as \"a close, personal friend\" and a \"constituency colleague\".\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson shares an office with both Mr Givan and outgoing DUP leader Edwin Poots.\nSir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, first became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell in the mid-1980s, before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. \nAfter Lord Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Mr Donaldson was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections.\nHe is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during The Troubles.\nIn 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, Mr Donaldson announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. \nJeffrey Donaldson was appointed to the UK Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007, and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010.\nHe was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service.\nSir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May 2021.\nOn Monday, Stormont finance minister and Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Conor Murphy accused the DUP of having \"no intention\" of delivering on commitments in NDNA.\nThis agreement brokered the return of power-sharing after three years of deadlock.\nMr Murphy told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party did not \"want to box anybody in\" but questioned the DUP's \"credibility\" if it could not deliver on the commitments.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said the next leader of the DUP cannot be allowed to \"choreograph the collapse of the institutions at Stormont\".\nWhen Paul Givan resigns it will trigger a seven-day period for new nominations to the posts of first and deputy first minister, or the possibility of a fresh election.\nMr Eastwood said the \"imminent resignation\" of the DUP's first minister showed that the party intended to \"manufacture another political crisis that will once again threaten our local institutions\".\n\"In a desperate attempt to stabilise their own party, they are recklessly prepared to destabilise devolution,\" he said.\nPotential new leaders must submit their nomination in writing, supported by a proposer and a seconder, to DUP chairman Lord Morrow by midday on Tuesday, with a result confirmed on Saturday.\nOnly Stormont assembly members (MLAs) and members of parliament (MPs) are entitled to take part if there is a vote.\nIn May's contest, Sir Jeffrey, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997, lost by 19 votes to 17 in the first DUP leadership election in its 50-year history.\nAmong the first tasks for a new leader will be a decision over the ministerial team appointed by Edwin Poots.\nPaul Givan is likely to become the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland when he is removed, while a new leader could have other plans for the education, economy and agriculture portfolios."

      "tags": "UK contaminated blood inquiry,NHS",
      "text": "The infection of up to 30,000 people with contaminated blood has been called the biggest treatment disaster in NHS history. Thousands have died.\nA public inquiry has been taking evidence since 2019 from people affected by the scandal.\nPeople with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders were given blood infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses, during the 1970s and 1980s.\nIt was the result of a new treatment intended to make their lives better. A clotting agent called Factor VIII was introduced to help their blood clot.  \nBefore this, patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries.  \nPeople who had blood transfusions after an operation, or childbirth, are also thought to have been exposed.    \nAbout 5,000 people are believed to have been infected - but some estimates put the number at 30,000. Nearly 3,000 people have died.  \nThe UK was struggling to keep up with demand for the Factor VIII blood clotting treatment, so supplies began to be imported from the US.    \nBut much of the human blood plasma used to make it came from donors such as prison inmates and drug-users, who sold their blood.\nThese groups were at higher risk of blood-borne viruses.\nHowever, at the time, HIV had not been diagnosed and understanding about hepatitis was still developing.\nThe risk of contamination was raised further because Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors and concentrating it.   \nBy the mid-1980s, once it was clear HIV was blood-borne, the products started to be heat-treated, to kill the viruses. \nBut questions remain about how much was known before this time.\nDespite these precautions, some of the contaminated blood products remained in circulation and continued to be used.\nScreening of all blood products began in 1991. \nAnd by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk.\nThe UK-wide inquiry was launched after years of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was covered up. It is being led by former judge Sir Brian Langstaff.\nOne of the first to take the stand in 2019 was Derek Martindale, who has haemophilia. He was 23 when he was diagnosed with HIV and given a year to live, in 1985. He survived but his brother - who was also infected with HIV - did not.   \nThe inquiry has also heard from victims' relatives including Liz Hooper, who lost two husbands, both of whom had been given infected blood.\nPoliticians giving evidence include Matt Hancock, who did so while still health secretary. He said the government would pay compensation if that is what the inquiry recommended.\nLord Clarke, told the inquiry that he had not been responsible for blood products during his time as health minister, and later health secretary, in the 1980s.\nMinisters from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already given evidence.\nFinancial compensation for the families of victims has been an ongoing question, with UK nations offering different levels.\nIn March, Cabinet Office minister Penny Mordaunt announced compensation for victims' families in England would be increased, to bring it in line with other parts of the UK.\nThere have been thousands of cases of people being given infected blood in the US. \nBut other countries also imported blood products during the 1970s and 1980s. \nIn Europe, cases in France, Ireland, Portugal and Italy have been identified. Japan, Canada, Iran and Iraq have also been caught up in the scandal.\nIn the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions of dollars in out-of-court settlements.\nIn other countries, politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence. \nNone of that has happened in the UK - although victims have been given limited financial support.\nAt the opening of the inquiry, it was announced that criminal trials could follow."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are \"looking good\", the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants.\nBut he warned there could be a \"rough winter for all sorts of reasons\", including a resurgence of flu.\nIt comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced.\nAsked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: \"You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for.\n\"But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point.\"\nHis comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu \"could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid.\"\nFlu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come \"back to bite us\", he said.\nMr Johnson said the risk of a \"rough winter\" was \"all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can\".\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more.\nFor the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. \n\"We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,\" the health secretary said.\n\"We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so.\"\nThe trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. \nCurrently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days.\nThis means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise.  \nThe rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. \nSo far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose.\nMore than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. \nThere have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases.\nThe prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers.\nAsked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. \n\"But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in.\"\nCurrently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab.\nHowever, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. \nHe said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next \"checkpoint\" taking place on 28 June.  \nHe said that the checkpoints would look at whether the \"science would support\" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. \nThe original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. \nHowever, some restrictions have still been eased. \nThe number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue.\nAnd in Wales, rules are also being lifted slightly, including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.\nIn Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotland are expected to be extended until mid-July.

They expanded the range and it's been in store and online for the last three years. Despite the losses, the products are said to have been selling well as we treated ourselves during lockdown. \nHotel Chocolat has branched out into selling all sorts of cacao-based products, from cacao gin and salted caramel vodka to posh chocolate ice cream and hot drinks.  Diversifying your product offering can be a risky distraction for any business, but it's also a way to boost sales and profits. Hotel Chocolat thinks it's a recipe for success and will hopefully lure new customers, as well as add value to the brand.\nThe Hotel Chocolat group already owns 47% of Rabot, while Mr Gerrie, who is also the group's non-executive chairman, owns 40.5%.\nMr Gerrie will receive \u00a33 in exchange for his stake, while the remaining investors will share the other \u00a31 between them.\nAfter it buys his stake in Rabot, Hotel Chocolat will pay back a \u00a3744,000 loan that Mr Gerrie provided to the beauty business.\nIt will give him more than 200,000 newly issued Hotel Chocolat shares, increasing his stake in the group by about 40%.\nWayne Brown, an analyst at Liberum, said the deal would help Hotel Chocolat to differentiate itself from other chocolate brands.\nHe also added that it would allow operations to be integrated, which should eventually \"see Rabot begin to turn a profit versus the current slight loss\".

And we want to use that public investment to trigger waves of private investment.\"\nThis government plans to put its money where its mouth is as it talks about plans to reinforce the UK's position as a global science leader.\nIt aims to increase research spending from nearly \u00a315bn a year to \u00a322bn by 2025. \nThe stated aim is to use the extra money to tackle societal challenges, such as the impact of climate change, level up across the country and boost prosperity around the world. \nAs ever though, with greater budgets, comes greater ministerial supervision - in the form of a new committee chaired by the prime minister. \nOn the one hand, it puts science at the heart of government, but on the other there's concern that there will be more political control on research budgets that could mean money being diverted toward pet projects - rather than spent on what is independently judged by experts to be the best science - as is currently the case.\nThe stated aim of the new Office for Science and Technology Strategy will be to push forward the government's research priorities. It will also identify resources needed to secure the UK's science capability.\nSir Patrick will take up the position of the new national technology adviser, alongside his other roles. These will include chairing a new National Science and Technology Council to help harness research for the \"public good\".\nHe said the changes would put science and technology \"right at the heart of policy making\" and said he looked forward to helping identify \"cutting-edge research and technologies\".\nBut James Wilsdon, who is digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said the reorganisation carried risks: \"Ministers and civil servants might have a bigger say over direction and priorities, at the expense of researchers themselves, who are typically better-placed to know where opportunities lie. \n\"It also raises questions about how much of the extra investment that the government has promised by 2025 will be channelled towards Whitehall projects, and how much will go through (the science funding body) UK Research and Innovation and into the mainstream of university research funding.\"\nChi Onwurah MP, Labour's Shadow Science Minister, said that research cuts this year had damaged UK science.\n\"Ministers have cut the budget for science this year leaving researchers and programmes in the lurch, and medical research charities have been left to fend for themselves during the pandemic,\" she explained.\n\"More government structures cannot disguise the fact the government has no long-term plan for UK science and is letting our country's researchers down.\"\n\"Boris Johnson blowing his own trumpet won't protect the UK's status as a science superpower - only a proper plan backed with long-term investment can do that.\""

      "text": "Scotland's first minister has defended the ban on non-essential travel with Manchester and Salford after an angry reaction from the area's mayor.\nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has now written to Nicola Sturgeon asking her to explain the move.\nMs Sturgeon earlier said the decision was a public health measure, based on Covid levels in the area.\nOpposition politicians in Scotland said there had been a lack of consistency and a lack of consultation.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon - who received her second vaccination in Glasgow on Monday - said she had a \"duty\" to keep Scotland as safe as possible.\n\"I have always got on well with Andy Burnham. If he wants a grown-up conversation he only has to pick up the phone,\" she said.\n\"But if, as I suspect might be the case, this is more about getting into a spat with me as part of a some positioning in a Labour leadership contest of the future, then I am not interested.\"\nThe first minister said she was \"confused\" by Mr Burnham's position.\n\"Back in May we imposed travel restrictions on Bolton for exactly the same reasons we are now doing it on Manchester,\" she said.\n\"Andy Burnham is mayor of Bolton as well and he did not raise any of these issues then.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the restrictions would not be enforced differently to previous travel rules, and would be in place \"no longer than is absolutely necessary\".\nMr Burnham acknowledged the first minister has faced \"difficult decisions\" during the pandemic but condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: \"The UK government has called me when they were making changes affecting Greater Manchester.  I think the first minister should have extended us the same courtesy.\n\"If Westminster had, without notice, imposed a travel ban on Scotland on Friday, I feel pretty certain in saying the first minister would have expressed publicly her concern in exactly the same way I am doing that on behalf of the people of Greater Manchester.\"  \nMr Burnham's letter to the first minister also asks why residents of Bolton are still subject to a travel ban while residents of Dundee, which he said has a higher case rate, are not. \nIn Dundee the latest seven-day positive test rate per 100,000 population, up to 18 June, was 303.4. On Monday the seven-day figure in Bolton was 257. \nMr Burnham also called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket and described the suggestion he was playing politics as \"fairly insulting\". \nMurdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesman for Covid recovery, said Mr Burnham was \"absolutely correct\" to express concern about the ban and the \"lack of consultation\".\nMr Fraser told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme there was a \"lack of consistency\" in the Scottish government's approach.\n\"We know that the city of Dundee, for example, has case rates very similar to Manchester,\" he said.\n\"So why is there a travel ban being introduced for Scots going to Manchester, but there are no similar restrictions put in, in relation to Dundee?\"\nDundee, which has the highest Covid case rate in Scotland, recorded 487 new cases in the week up to 18 June, according to UK government figures.\nManchester recorded 1,928 cases and Salford 880 in the same period, but the rate per 100,000 people for all three areas is very similar.\nJackie Baillie, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said people would find the ban hard to understand.\n\"This has just been put in place without any consultation, without any dialogue and without any concern for either the people of Manchester or the tourism industry in Scotland,\" she said.\n\"Are we consistent in saying it's OK to travel in and out of areas of Scotland where the rates of infection are higher than they are in Manchester? That's the inconsistency that people just do not understand.\"\nAre you affected by the ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford? Have you had to change your plans?

It's a complete unknown.\"\nHe said the 25,000 capacity event sold out in \"record time\" in February showing \"how much people were looking forward to enjoying a sense of joy and community\".\nBut organisers would have to spend \"between \u00a31m and \u00a32m\" over the next two weeks to arrange the festival with no guarantee of what conditions might be imposed when it happened, Mr Smith said.\nA letter to ticketholders said: \"Last Monday saw the delay of the so-called 'Freedom Day'.\n\"As Kendal Calling sits outside of this delay we would still be in a strong position to proceed.\n\"But Monday also saw a less publicised delay; the release of the long-awaited research from the ERP (Events Research Programme) pilot events, which would inform the publication of crucial new safety guidance on how we run events.\n\"Without this safety guidance, there are numerous aspects of the festival we cannot plan.\"\nOrganisers said cancelling in 2020 had been \"sad but understandable\" but that doing the same this year was both \"heartbreaking\" and \"infuriating\".\n\"If calls for a government-backed insurance scheme had been heeded we could have potentially continued over the coming weeks,\" they said.\n\"We take this opportunity to urge the government to reappraise its approach and to listen to the recommendations of its own reports.\"\nKendal Calling is now due to take place from 28 to 31 July 2022.\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport it was \"working flat out to support festivals and live events\" and had given \u00a334m to organisers from the Culture Recovery Fund.\nA spokeswoman said the department was \"aware of wider concerns\" around insurance and indemnity cover in the current climate, adding: \"We are exploring what further support may be required when the sector is able to reopen.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

So they are less likely to see education as the way to improve their lives,\" writes Mr Millward.\nThe research emphasises the importance of place, identifying particularly low entry rates in \"former industrial towns and cities across the north and midlands, or coastal towns\".\nBut white students on free meals in London seemed to have bucked the trend, with an the entry rate that \"has pulled away from that in other parts of the country\" - and the capital overall has higher rates of going to university.\nFigures from the Department for Education last year reported that \"male white British free school meal pupils are the least likely of all the main ethnic groups to progress to higher education\".\nThe Education Select Committee is investigating why \"left behind white pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds\" seem to be underachieving in education."

      "text": "The number of deaths related to Covid-19 has passed 500,000 in Brazil, the second-highest in the world, as experts say the outbreak could worsen amid slow vaccination and the start of winter.\nThe virus continues to spread as President Jair Bolsonaro refuses to back measures like social distancing.\nThe health institute Fiocruz says the situation is \"critical\". Only 11% of adults are fully vaccinated. \nTens of thousands of Brazilians joined anti-government protests on Saturday.\nPresident Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for not implementing a co-ordinated national response and for his scepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements, which he has sought to loosen.\nThe country has reported, on average, 70,000 cases and 2,000 deaths daily in the past week. Most of the new infections and deaths were among people aged 20-59, Fiocruz said, warning that the start of winter in the southern hemisphere, next week, could result in more infections.\nDespite this, governors and mayors have already relaxed the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus. In many cities, restaurants, bars and shops have reopened while many people in the streets do not wear face masks or follow social distancing.\n\"People in Brazil are tired and they normalise death now so I think we still have a long way to go,\" Dr Natalia Pasternak Taschner, a microbiologist at the Question of Science Institute, told the BBC.\n\"If we're not successful in changing the behaviour of people and if we don't have campaigns for mask wearing, social distancing and vaccinations coming directly from the central government we're not going to be able to control it.\"\nOn Saturday, protests against President Bolsonaro were held in cities across the country, with demonstrators accusing him of delaying the purchase of vaccines while prioritising unproven treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine.\nIn rallies in Rio de Janeiro, Bras\u00edlia and elsewhere, furious Brazilians carried banners with slogans like \"Bolsonaro must go\" or simply \"500,000\".\n\"His position on Covid and his denialism are absurd. He has abandoned reality and common sense. There is no explaining this, it is surreal,\" Robert Almeida, a 50-year-old marching in Rio, told AFP.\nProtester Denise Azevedo told Reuters: \"Herd immunity won't do any good. The only immunity you can get is with the vaccine. There is no early treatment. I have lost many friends, almost lost a cousin... people are orphans, fatherless, motherless, and childless.\" \nThe outbreak in Brazil has been fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus, including the one first identified in the Amazon region and now known as Gamma. The rate of occupancy of intensive care unit beds remains at or above 80% in most states, while cities struggle with short supplies of vaccines.\nA parliamentary inquiry at the Brazilian Senate is looking into President Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic. The opposition accuses him of delaying vaccine orders for political reasons, as he has consistently played down the severity of the pandemic.\nBut the president, whose popularity has plummeted, says he has done all he can to buy vaccines from several countries. He also insists the impact of lockdowns on the economy would be worse than the virus, a position shared by his supporters.\nPresident Bolsonaro has not commented on the 500,000 deaths. On Twitter, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga expressed solidarity with the \"fathers, mothers, friends and relatives\" of those who had died.\nOnly the US has reported more total deaths related to Covid-19."

The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "text": "A large number of poorer countries receiving Covid-19 vaccines through a global sharing scheme do not have enough doses to continue programmes, the World Health Organization has said.\nWHO senior adviser Dr Bruce Aylward said the Covax programme had delivered 90 million doses to 131 countries.\nBut he said this was nowhere near enough to protect populations from a virus still spreading worldwide.\nThe shortages come as some nations in Africa see a third wave of infections.\nOn Monday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called for an end to vaccine hoarding by wealthier countries as his government scrambled to curb a steep rise in cases.\nOn a continental level, only 40 million doses have been administered so far in Africa - less than 2% of the population, Mr Ramaphosa said.\nTo address this, he said his government was working with Covax to create a regional hub to produce more vaccines in South Africa.\nCovax was created last year to ensure Covid-19 doses were made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations.\nLed by the WHO and other international organisations, Covax initially set a target of providing two billion doses worldwide by the end of 2021. \nMost of those are being donated to poorer countries, where Covax hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the populations.\nHowever, the distribution of these vaccines has been hampered by manufacturing delays and supply disruptions, leading to shortages in countries wholly reliant on Covax.\nUganda, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Trinidad and Tobago are just some of the countries that have reported running out of vaccines in recent days.\nAt a WHO briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday, Dr Aylward acknowledged the extent of those shortages in stark terms.\nOf the 80 low-income countries involved in Covax, \"at least half of them do not have sufficient vaccines to be able to sustain their programmes right now,\" Dr Aylward said.\n\"If we look at what we're hearing from countries on a day-to-day basis, well over half of countries have run out of stock and are calling for additional vaccine. But in reality it's probably much higher,\" Dr Aylward said.\nHe said some countries had tried to make alternative arrangements to end shortages, with harsh consequences, such as paying above market value for vaccines.\nAs vaccine supplies come under strain, some wealthier countries with spare doses are leading efforts to step up donations through Covax and other means.\nOn Monday the administration of US President Joe Biden announced how it planned to donate 55 million vaccine doses to countries in need.\nOf those, 41 million would be distributed through Covax, with the remaining 14 million shared with countries deemed to be priorities.\nThese vaccines are not included in the 500 million doses President Biden said the US would donate via Covax. President Biden made that pledge earlier this month at a summit of major economic powers, known as the G7 (Group of Seven).\nTogether, those G7 members committed to donate one billion vaccines to poorer countries over this year.\nBut campaigners criticised the pledge, saying it lacked ambition, was far too slow and showed Western leaders were not serious about tackling the worst public health crisis in a century.\nSome health experts believe it could be months - if not years - before enough people are vaccinated globally to declare an end to the pandemic.\nWhen asked about global need for vaccines on Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said: \"What we have found to be the biggest challenge is not actually the supply, we have plenty of doses to share with the world, but this is a Herculean logistical challenge.\""

Those promises have not been met, reports John Sudworth.\nThe first time China made a public promise to help find Kalbinur Tursan's children was in 2019.\n\"If you have people who have lost their children, you give me the names,\" China's then-ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, told the BBC in a live television interview in July that year.\nMr Liu denied that China's policies in its far-western region of Xinjiang could be leading to the large-scale separation of children from their parents but, he said, if we had any such evidence, he would investigate.\n\"We'll try to locate them and let you know who they are, what they're doing,\" he said.\nKalbinur  - a member of Xinjiang's largest Turkic ethnic group, the Uyghurs - now lives in Turkey, working late into the night in her tiny one-room apartment sewing clothes to support what is left of her shattered family.\nShe arrived in 2016, eight months pregnant with her seventh child, Merziye, conceived in violation of China's family-planning laws.\n\"If the Chinese authorities had known I was pregnant they would probably have forced me to abort my baby,\" she told me.\n\"So, I prepared my body by wrapping my belly to hide the bump for two hours every day and we managed to pass the border control like that.\"\nAlthough Kalbinur had applied for passports for all of her children, China's tough restrictions on travel for Xinjiang's ethnic groups meant that only one - for her two-year-old son Muhammed - was granted.\nWith time running out, she had little choice but to leave the others behind, hoping they could follow with her husband once they'd been given their documents.\nAs she boarded her flight, she had no idea that she wouldn't see them again.\nOut of sight, sweeping silently across China's vast western region, a campaign of mass-incarceration had already begun with a rapidly expanding network of what were, at first, highly secretive \"re-education\" camps.\nA parallel network of boarding schools was also being built with the same aim; the forced-assimilation of Xinjiang's Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other minority groups whose identity, culture and Islamic traditions were now seen as a threat by the ruling Communist Party.\nOne policy paper, published the year after Kalbinur's departure, made clear that the purpose of such boarding schools was to \"break the influence of the religious atmosphere\" on children living at home.\nA few weeks after her departure, her husband was detained and - like so many thousands of other members of the Uyghur diaspora watching their family members disappear from afar - she found herself in exile.\nAlmost overnight, even calling relatives became impossible because, for those still in Xinjiang, any overseas communication was seen as a potential sign of radicalisation and a key reason for being sent to a camp.\nFacing almost certain detention if she returned to Xinjiang, and with her children now parentless, she's had no contact with them at all - except for one shocking discovery.\nSearching online in 2018, she came across a video of her daughter, Ayse, now two years older than when she'd last seen her, in a school more than 500 kilometres from the family home.\nWith her hair shaved short, she was with a group of children being led in a game by a teacher speaking not in Uyghur - her mother tongue - but in Chinese.\nFor Kalbinur, the video brought both relief - a tangible link to at least one of her lost children - and deep anguish, as a painful, visual reminder of the guilt and grief that have never left her.\n\"Knowing she was in a different city made me think it's impossible to find my children, even if I do go back,\" she told me.\n\"To my children, I want them to know that I didn't abandon them, I had no choice but to leave them behind, because if I had stayed their new-born sister wouldn't have lived.\"\nKalbinur's story is just one of a large number of similar accounts of missing children gathered by the BBC from members of Xinjiang's Uyghur and Kazakh diasporas in Turkey and Kazakhstan.\nHaving first sought their permission, we sent Ambassador Liu Xiaoming the details of six of our interviewees, and attached copies of passports, Chinese ID cards and last-known addresses.\nThree of the cases involved parents who had reason to believe their children were now in the care of the Chinese state.\nAlthough his 2019 TV-appearance marked China's first public promise to investigate, similar assurances had already been given in private a few months earlier, when the BBC was taken on a government-organised tour of the camps in Xinjiang.\nThe initial secrecy had given way to a new strategy, with China insisting that the camps were, in fact, vocational schools in which those under the influence of separatist or extremist ideology willingly had their thoughts \"transformed\".\nThe Deputy Director of Xinjiang's Publicity Department, Xu Guixiang, denied that a generation of Uyghur and Kazakh children were being effectively orphaned as whole extended families - including all adult caregivers - were detained or stranded overseas.\n\"If all family members have been sent to education training centres, that family must have a severe problem,\" he told me.\n\"I've never seen such a case.\"\nBut when we passed on the details of some of our cases - again, with their prior permission - the officials promised to look into it.\nOne of the cases - handed to the officials in Xinjiang and sent to Ambassador Liu - involved not only missing children, but 14 missing grandchildren.\nOriginally from the village of Bestobe in the county of Kunes in northern Xinjiang, 66-year-old Khalida Akytkankyzy - like many ethnic Kazakhs - had family ties across the border in Kazakhstan.\nIn 2006 she and her husband, along with their youngest son, decided to emigrate, leaving her other three sons - already married and with children of their own - in Xinjiang.\nBut in early 2018, the relentless machinery of mass internment caught up with them too.\nKhalida received news that her three sons and their wives had all been detained \"for political education\".\nShe tried desperately to get information, including calling the Communist Party official in her old village, but no one would tell her who was looking after her grandchildren.\nBy 2019, when China began claiming that the camps had been successful in combating separatism and terrorism and that almost everyone had \"graduated\", for Khalida the news only got worse.\nWith the massive, parallel increase in Xinjiang's formal prison population continuing unabated, her two eldest sons, Satybaldy and Orazjan, were sentenced to 22 years each, and her third son, Akhmetjan, to 10 years.\nThe village official told her they'd been convicted for \"praying\".\nIf there were other reasons for their imprisonment then  the authorities have provided no details.\nChina's UK embassy confirmed receipt of the letter and documents we'd addressed to Ambassador Liu but, although we sent follow-up emails in November 2019 and again in February 2020, our questions remained unanswered.\nThe officials in Xinjiang told us there was a \"discrepancy\" in the information we'd handed to them, and advised us to tell our interviewees to contact their nearest Chinese embassies instead.\nIn July 2020, Ambassador Liu appeared again on the same, live television programme, and was asked what had happened to his promise of a year earlier.\n\"I never received any names since our last show,\" he told the interviewer, Andrew Marr.\n\"I hope that you can give me the names, we certainly will get back to you.\"\nHe went on to suggest that his counterparts in Xinjiang would be able to facilitate such requests with ease - \"they respond to us very quickly,\" he added.\nSo, we followed up again, sending emails in August and September 2020 and in January 2021.\n\"Chase-up email received,\" reads the latest response from an official at the embassy. \"I regret no progress has been made so far.\" \nNowadays, Khalida wakes early and takes a number of interconnecting buses to the Chinese consulate in the city of Almaty, just as the officials had advised us to tell her to do.\nCarrying photographs of her three sons, however, she finds her daily attempts to seek answers blocked by a line of police.\n\"It's not just to me,\" she said in a video interview from her home.\n\"I'm often there with 10-15 other people and the Chinese consulate doesn't give any information to anyone.\"\nIn Turkey, Kalbinur is also still fighting for information about her husband, Abdurehim Rozi, and her five missing children, Abduhalik, Subinur, Abdulsalam, Ayse and Abdullah.\nShe recently took part in a 400km walk from Istanbul to Ankara with other Uyghur mothers, in a bid to break the silence of the Chinese authorities about their relatives.\nHer campaigning has at least prompted a limited response, in a press conference - chaired by Xinjiang's deputy propaganda chief, Xu Guixiang - denying that her daughter is in a boarding school and insisting instead that the children are being looked after by a relative.\nBut Kalbinur is still unable to contact them and so China's claims are impossible to verify.\n\"I want the authorities to let me see my children,\" she told me over a video call as she took a break from her protest walk at the side of a busy highway.\n\"In this information age, why can't I contact my children?\"\nOne of the cases we sent to Ambassador Liu did not involve missing children, but a missing mother instead.\nIn 2017, Xiamuinuer Pida, a 68-year old retired engineer with a long service record at a Chinese state-run company, was sent to a camp, where she was interned for 18 months before being released.\nHer daughter, Reyila Abulaiti, who has lived in the UK since 2002, says the authorities are still refusing to grant her mother a passport, keeping her - like many other former camp inmates - under close surveillance in her home.\nDuring our 2019 visit to Xinjiang, Chinese officials insisted that she was entirely free but simply suffering from ill health, with one of them telling us that many elderly Uyghurs suffer dietary problems - \"too much meat and milk,\" he said.\nIt was a suggestion that infuriated and saddened Reyila, who told me that her mother had, in fact, lost 15kg (33 pounds) in weight as a result of the harsh conditions during her incarceration.\n\"They're trying to hide what they are doing,\" she replied, when asked about the authorities' failure to explain why Xiamuinuer had been sent for re-education.\n\"She's a well-educated, retired woman, she doesn't need vocational courses. She's been in a camp and they don't want my mum to speak out.\" \nEarlier this year, Liu Xiaoming completed his tenure as Chinese ambassador to the UK, with an online farewell to British politicians and dignitaries and with his promise still unmet by the Chinese authorities.\nMeanwhile, I've been forced to leave China as a result of the increasing pressure from the authorities over my journalism and, in particular, a growing number of threats to sue me over my reporting on Xinjiang.\nSome of those threats have come directly from Xu Guixiang, the official I'd interviewed two years previously in Xinjiang.\nThe BBC had produced \"fake news\" and violated professional ethics, he told China's Communist Party-run media.\nYet despite the continued insistence of Chinese officials that - if we provided names - a quick search would easily disprove that families were being forcibly divided, they have offered only silence.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, we're still waiting to learn the whereabouts of a number of other children, including those of Yasin Zunun, who suspects that Muslima, Fatima, Parhat, Nurbiya and Asma are in a boarding school.\nMerbet Maripet has heard nothing from her four children, Abdurahman, Muhammad, Adila and Mardan since 2017, and also believes they're now in the care of the state.\nWe asked the Chinese Foreign Ministry why no branch of government has been able to deliver on the clear promises to provide information about the missing individuals.\nNo response was received before this report was published.\nProducer: Kathy Long"

      "text": "Ellie Morgan's Covid jab appointment was just 20 minutes but actually getting the vaccine took her all day.\nThe 26-year-old is in the under-40 age range advised against having the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, so she had to get to her local mass vaccination centre.\nBut she lives in a rural part of Wales and had to rely on public transport to get her Pfizer vaccination dose.\nIt comes as a GP says more should be done to help some young people in rural areas get to their vaccine appointment.\nThe Welsh government said its health service had built a \"mix of sites\" for Wales' largest vaccination programme - almost 450 jab locations - to not just \"meet the characteristics of the vaccines\" but to be \"conveniently located\" to as many people as possible.\nEllie had to go to a mass clinic as that's where the sub-zero temperature freezers are storing the Pfizer doses for under-40s due to the rare blood clot link.\nHer appointment was at 13:30 BST last Wednesday - and in a car the journey would be about 45 minutes.\nBut Ellie did not have access to a car, and there were just seven buses a day between her home town of Monmouth in south Wales and the mass clinic in Newport.\n\"It was an hour there by bus but I also had to arrive two hours before my allotted time, as the next bus from Monmouth would've made me miss my appointment,\" she said.\n\"All my friends and family work in the week so it wasn't possible for a lift from anyone,\" she said.\n\"I also consider environmental reasons quite highly and try wherever possible to use public transport.\n\"It was all fine, however it ended up being a whole day's activity and meant that any other plans that day were off the table. Also if I had missed that one bus, then there would have been no way for me to get there other than taxi, which I dread to think how much that would cost.\"\nEllie works as an offshore geotechnical engineer, so it wasn't just a case of working out how to get to her jab, it was ensuring she was home for it too.\n\"The actual jab part of it took less that 20mins,\" she said. \"That bit was super efficient!\"\nBut after leaving her house at about 10:00 to make the trip for her jab, she arrived home after 17:00, because the next bus back to Monmouth was a few hours after her vaccine.\n\"The way my job is, it wasn't that bad,\" she said.\n\"But for people with normal jobs, it would have been a whole day off work. It's nothing major but just pretty awkward and inconvenient.\"\nOf those people in Wales aged 18 to 29, almost 68% (323,965 people) have had their first jab while almost 73% (309,352) of those in their 30s have had a first dose\nLocal authorities in the Aneurin Bevan health board area - topped by Caerphilly and Monmouthshire - lead the way with giving first doses to those in their 30s, reaching more than 80%, while north Wales areas had reached the fewest, about two-thirds.\nAs for those aged 18 to 29, Monmouthshire and Caerphilly again lead the way with more than 75%, while west Wales areas and Bridgend have reached the lowest proportions, including less than half in Ceredigion. \nAll adults in Wales have been offered a first dose of the Covid vaccine, with almost 1.5m people receiving both doses.\nBut one rural doctor wants more to help some young people in rural areas get to their Covid vaccination appointments.\n\"The next challenge we need to sort is getting the Pfizer vaccine out to people under 40 in rural areas,\" said Dr Eilir Hughes, who runs a practice in the Gwynedd coastal village of Nefyn.\n\"Younger people need to have this particular vaccine, and can't be given the AstraZeneca jab. \n\"But up to now, the Pfizer vaccine has mainly been administered in the mass vaccination centres such as Llandudno and Bangor, because it needs to be stored at low temperatures.\"\nFor example, to travel between his practice on Gwynedd's Ll\u0177n Peninsula to the centre in Bangor on public transport could take more than two hours, even though it is less than 30 miles away.\n\"Bangor and Llandudno are a long way from rural communities like the one where I work in Nefyn, and from places like Aberdaron and Pwllheli,\" he added.\n\"We need to crack this one to reach the right level of immunity around all communities in Wales, urban, rural and everywhere.\"\nIn north Wales, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has held Pfizer vaccine clinics in Ysbyty Alltwen, near Porthmadog, and in Dolgellau.  \n\"Those are a good start, but we need to get more uptake and more flexibility,\" Dr Hughes told Radio Wales.\n\"With the Pfizer vaccine it is more fragile, you have to take more care and the logistics element is more of a challenge than AstraZeneca. \n\"You've got almost a month to use up that vaccine, we have to be more agile, we have to be able to offer the clinics at more flexible times for people who are working... people who have been drastically affected by the lockdown. \n\"We need to make it as smooth of a process as possible for them.\"\nHe added that GP surgeries may be able to help to increase uptake.\n\"Perhaps we can do more vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine, and more importantly, reach out into our local communities and connect with people to get them vaccinated.\"\nThe Welsh NHS is currently administering vaccinations in 446 locations across Wales, including 52 mass vaccination centres, 301 surgeries, 39 pharmacies, 20 hospitals and 27 mobile jab teams.\n\"To deliver the largest vaccination programme Wales has ever seen, we have been building an infrastructure from the ground-up,\" said a Welsh government official.\nThe government added there is a \"mix of sites to maximise speed of roll-out, ensure safety, meet the needs of the characteristics of the vaccines, be as conveniently located as possible and, importantly, make sure we give equitable access across the country and all communities\".

      "text": "Hundreds of Welsh fans are expected in Azerbaijan for Wales' opening Euro 2020 match, despite travel guidance.\nThousands were due to fly to the capital Baku this week for the start of the tournament, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic.\nWales play Switzerland in Baku on Saturday, Turkey on Wednesday, and the Italians in Rome the following Sunday.\nAzerbaijan and Italy are on the UK and Welsh governments' amber lists, meaning you should not travel there.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford and the Football Association of Wales have called on fans not to go to the matches.\nBefore returning to Wales, they will need to take a PCR test, and then quarantine at home for 10 days. \nFan James Robinson, 44, is planning to fly directly to Baku from Cardiff on Friday.\nHe has tickets for all three of Wales' group matches but said he was likely to only attend the games against Switzerland and Turkey in Baku due to quarantine rules in Italy.\nItaly requires travellers to self-isolate for 10 days if they do not have proof of a negative test, and inform the region they are travelling to of their visit.\n\"I had plenty of doubts. I wasn't really sure it was going to happen until last week. I think my friend and I talked our way into it and thought, 'let's go and do it',\" he said.\n\"We've got to get a private PCR test and get the result before we arrive in Baku. They also need proof of the tickets for the Euros and that's how you get the visa for entry.\"\nAccording to the Foreign Office, all passengers travelling to Azerbaijan will require a negative Covid-19 test.\nTicketholders for matches scheduled in Baku will qualify for a quarantine exemption if they present proof of a recent negative result.\nOther visitors will still need to self-isolate for 14 days. \nMost businesses including restaurants and cafes are open in Azerbaijan and mask wearing is only mandatory indoors.\nMr Robinson said: \"It's obviously going to be a lot smaller scale than 2016. We're expecting maybe around 500 fans out there. But I'm sure we'll all stick together and make plenty of noise in the stadium.\"\nRichard Collier, 37, from Aberdare, is flying to Baku via Kiev in Ukraine with two friends.\n\"There have been a few times when we thought we might not go due to different restrictions, or it gets cancelled again,\" he said.\n\"But now we've got to this point we're adamant we're getting out there no matter what happens.\"\nDespite the advice not to travel, Mr Collier said he hoped the players appreciated the efforts of those who will be in the stadium on Saturday.\nRhys Hartley, 27, lives in the Serbian capital Belgrade and is travelling to Baku via Istanbul in Turkey. \nHe hopes to be able to return to Belgrade following the match against Turkey in preparation for a trip to Italy the following Sunday.\n\"Hopefully, we can make it to Rome as well and then hopefully see Wales in the knock-out stages. If that game is in the UK then it might be more difficult to make it due to the restrictions, so perhaps a last-16 match in somewhere like the Netherlands will be better for us,\" he said."

      "text": "Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are \"looking good\", the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants.\nBut he warned there could be a \"rough winter for all sorts of reasons\", including a resurgence of flu.\nIt comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced.\nAsked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: \"You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for.\n\"But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point.\"\nHis comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu \"could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid.\"\nFlu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come \"back to bite us\", he said.\nMr Johnson said the risk of a \"rough winter\" was \"all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can\".\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more.\nFor the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. \n\"We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,\" the health secretary said.\n\"We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so.\"\nThe trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. \nCurrently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days.\nThis means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise.  \nThe rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. \nSo far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose.\nMore than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. \nThere have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases.\nThe prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers.\nAsked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. \n\"But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in.\"\nCurrently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab.\nHowever, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. \nHe said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next \"checkpoint\" taking place on 28 June.  \nHe said that the checkpoints would look at whether the \"science would support\" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. \nThe original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. \nHowever, some restrictions have still been eased. \nThe number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue.\nAnd in Wales, rules are also being lifted slightly, including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.\nIn Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotland are expected to be extended until mid-July.

It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 14 other people.\nThere have been a further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, latest daily government figures show.\nAnother 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced.\nLast Friday there were 7,439 cases and six deaths.\nAll adults can now book Covid-19 jabs in England.\nElsewhere in the UK, people aged 30 and over can get their vaccine in Scotland, although in some parts of Glasgow people aged 18 and over can get a first jab.\nIn Wales, people aged 18 and over can get the vaccine, with the Welsh government announcing that all adults had been offered a vaccine earlier this week.\nIn Northern Ireland, people aged 18 and over can book online or call 0300 200 7813.\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency said: \"Cases are rising rapidly across the country and the Delta variant is now dominant. The increase is primarily in younger age groups, a large proportion of which were unvaccinated but are now being invited to receive the vaccine. \n\"It is encouraging to see that hospitalisations and deaths are not rising at the same rate but we will continue to monitor it closely. The vaccination programme and the care that we are all taking to follow the guidance are continuing to save lives.\"\nSarah Crofts from the ONS said: \"Given the recent announcements to delay the easing of lockdown restrictions, it's critical that we are tracking infection rates over the next few weeks and analysing the impact of the Delta variant.\""

      "text": "The introduction of flexible rail tickets - aimed at a growing number of commuters who only travel to the office two or three days a week - has had a muted response.\nThe Campaign for Better Transport said commuters will be \"disappointed\", while rail expert Tony Miles, of Modern Railways magazine, also had reservations.\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new tickets would offer \"greater freedom and choice about how we travel, simpler ticketing and a fairer fare\".\nWe asked regular train travellers for their first impressions.\nSteve Allibone commutes from Worthing to London, where he works in financial services. An annual season ticket from West Worthing to London Bridge costs him \u00a35,168. The flexible season ticket is \u00a3397 for 28 days, or \u00a35,161 annually - meaning he would save \u00a37 annually.\n\"In principle, it was quite a neat solution, but the cost and the pricing is a bit of a joke,\" he says. \nPre-Covid he was commuting five days a week and is currently going in one day a week, which will increase to two days a week after the restrictions ease.\n\"I could in theory save \u00a3400 if I only buy 12 of them, but that would require considerable planning when my weeks off are,\" he explains. When I saw the numbers I was disappointed.\" \nHe is also unimpressed with current service standards, noticing other passengers often having to stand for over an hour. Also, due to the frequency of train delays Mr Allibone was refunded \u00a3100 over the course of a year. \n\"The cost of the tickets has gone up and the quality of the service has gone down,\" he says. \nFor Philippa, a project manager who moved to Bath from close to Stansted, Essex, during the pandemic, the new tickets fail to offer a sufficiently attractive saving.  \nPhilippa, who did not want her surname used, works from home and misses the office. She does, though, have a \"lovely work life balance\".\n\"Before all this I was getting out of bed at 5.30 in the morning, coming back after work and going to bed and doing the same five days a week,\" she adds. \nAt the moment, her company is looking into a hybrid way of working, which would mean a couple of days a week in the office.\n\"I was hoping that I might be able to move to a couple of days a week in the office, enjoy London life and going out and things,\" Philippa explains. \nTo travel only two days out of seven would save Philippa only \u00a317.60 a year, so she is still weighing up other options for reducing costs such as moving back closer to London.\n\"I was secretly hoping for a much better deal,\" she says. \nKate Morgan, a management consultant in financial services, says her commute from Brighton to London, would be about 11% cheaper - \u00a330 a month - with a new flexible ticket.\nHowever, this reduction would be less than the cost of one day ticket, so any additional days required in the office would negate those savings. \"Far from it being good news for commuters, it's pretty appalling,\" she says. \n\"People's point of reference is their annual season ticket, so it's not right for rail companies to compare savings with daily tickets,\" she adds. \nFor Ms Morgan, returning to the office for two days a week is going to cost about the same as it would for five days a week.  \n\"The bit that I'm really disappointed in, is people have been working from home for 18 months and employers are in a difficult position - this really isn't helping that,\" she explains. \n\"It creates a real barrier in the way of that flexible working becoming a reality.\" \nNiall McGregor, from Norwich, commutes to Canary Wharf to work in a bank. Before Covid he commuted twice a week and worked from home on the other days.\n\"When you look at the price per journey, the numbers don't make it sufficiently attractive,\" he explains. \nHis annual season ticket costs \u00a38,884 for unlimited travel, whereas the Greater Anglia flexi ticket from Norwich to London would cost \u00a3682.30 - \u00a38,187 a year - for only eight tickets a month. \n\"It doesn't feel like a massive saving for what you're giving up in terms of travel days,\" he says, because it means he would swap 20 days a month travel for eight days a month travel to save \u00a3697 a year.\n\"The maths of the new flexible season ticket just don't make much sense,\" he adds. \nThe government estimates commuters could save between \u00a360 and \u00a3350 a year on selected journeys. Ministers say it might not be suitable for every commuter, but is tailored to the growing demand for more flexible working patterns.\nThe Department for Transport said: \"Flexible season tickets will offer most 2 and 3 day per week commuters savings against buying daily tickets or traditional seasons.\"\n\"We have always been clear that passengers should consider which product best suits their journey and travel pattern.\"\nAnd with the government planning a complete shake-up of the rail network, with the creation of Great British Railways, these changes could be just the start.\nThe Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators said the rail companies would certainly like to go further in reforming the fares system to help commuters secure the best deal.\nAnd the independent watchdog Transport Focus said the changes would help persuade people to choose rail travel again.\n\"Our research with passengers showed us there was strong demand for a new ticket that suited people who expected to commute less frequently in future,\" the group said."

      "title": "Bumble closes to give 'burnt-out' staff a week's break",
      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Employment,Dating apps,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Bumble, the dating app where women are in charge of making the first move, has temporarily closed all of its offices this week to combat workplace stress.\nIts 700 staff worldwide have been told to switch off and focus on themselves.\nOne senior executive revealed on Twitter that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd had made the move \"having correctly intuited our collective burnout\".\nBumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers.\nThe company announced in April \"that all Bumble employees will have a paid, fully offline one-week vacation in June\".\nA spokeswoman for Bumble said a few customer support staff will be working in case any of the app's users experience issues. These employees will then be given time off to make sure they take a whole week of leave. \nThe spokeswoman confirmed that the majority of Bumble's staff are taking the week off. \nBumble has grown in popularity during lockdown as boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up.\nThe number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, spiked by 30% in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year, according to its most recent set of results.\nMs Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. \nShe rang the Nasdaq bell with her 18-month-old baby son on her hip and in her speech she said she wanted to make the internet \"a kinder, more accountable place\".\nBy Dearbail Jordan\nBumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd's quest to make the internet a \"kinder\" place extends to the company's head office. And then some.\nBack in 2017, the firm unveiled its new headquarters in Texas. Saturated in Bumble's signature yellow, wall mirrors are emblazoned with messages such as \"you look bee-autiful honey\". Even the light switches have slogans, telling people to \"shine bright like a diamond\".\nIt also boasts a \"Mommy Bar\" - described as a \"private lactation space\" by Ms Wolfe Herd - as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and \"blowouts\" which the founder said showed \"appreciation for our busy bees\".\nWorking hours? Not nine to five apparently. Employees can choose the hours they want, just as long as the work gets done.\nCould the UK see the same sort of office environment here? With many people spending so much time at home recently, perhaps companies will follow through on making changes to working life. Just don't hold out for free manicures though.  \nWorkers in other industries have complained about working long hours and the effect on their well-being. \nEarlier this year, a group of younger bankers at Goldman Sachs warned they would be forced to quit unless conditions improved. They said they were working an average of 95 hours a week and slept five hours a night.\nA spokeswoman for the investment bank said at the time: \"A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.\"\nPrior to Covid, one of the most high-profile examples of overwork emerged in when Antonio Horta-Osorio, then the relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was forced to take a leave of absence. After joining the bank in January 2011, Mr Horta-Osorio took eight weeks off from November after prolonged insomnia led to exhaustion.\nFollowing his return, Mr Horta-Osorio - now chairman of Credit Suisse - led a re-evaluation at the bank on the importance of mental health. \nBumble made its announcement after several tech companies have unveiled their plans for remote working as the economy reopens.\nTwitter has said that it expects a majority of its staff to spend some time working remotely and some time in the office. That's despite its boss Jack Dorsey initially saying that employees could work from home \"forever\".\nAnd Google rejigged its timetable for bringing people back to the workplace. As of 1 September, employees wishing to work from home for more than 14 days a year would have to apply to do so.\nBut Apple employees have launched a campaign pushing back against boss Tim Cook's plans for a widespread return to the office, according to media reports earlier in June.\nIt followed an all-staff memo in which the Apple chief executive said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September.\nThe key to coping with burnout is control, according to experts. \"Not everyone has the option of leaving their job but it's about doing what you can with the things you can control,\" says Siobhan Murray, author of 'The Burnout Solution'.\nCary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, says it is \"important that individuals take control of their environment to manage the hours they work and ensure that they're socially connected.\" He advises:\nBut companies must play their part too, says Trades Union Congress health and safety officer, Shelly Asquith. Stress is an \"occupational hazard\" she says and it \"requires risk assessment and management to protect the wellbeing of staff\". \nOther companies, such as accountancy firm KPMG, have introduced new measures to combat the fatigue some workers might feel after more than a year of working in a less-than-ideal home set-up.\nVoice-only meetings, for example, are now required on Fridays to reduce the need for video calls.\nIt is in stark contrast to comments made by KPMG's UK chairman, Bill Michael, in February when he told colleagues to \"stop moaning\" during a virtual meeting discussing the pandemic and possible cuts to their pay, bonuses and pensions.   \nAccording to the Financial Times, Mr Michael also told employees to stop \"playing the victim card\". Mr Michael has since apologised and resigned."

      "tags": "Abiy Ahmed,Tigray crisis,Ethiopia",
      "text": "Ethiopians have been voting in key elections amid rising tensions and a conflict in the northern Tigray region.\nThis pandemic-delayed poll is Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's first electoral test since coming to power in 2018.\nBut the vote was postponed in Tigray, where the army has been fighting a local force since November.\nInsecurity and logistical problems have hit other parts of the country as well, so overall there was no voting in about a fifth of constituencies.\nThe Tigray conflict has sparked a humanitarian crisis, with 350,000 people living in famine conditions, according to a recent assessment.\nThe head of the electoral commission, Birtukan Mideksa, said that while things had gone mostly smoothly she was worried about the intimidation of opposition party agents in some places - particularly in the Amhara region and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region.\n\"Some complain they have been beaten or denied access to voting stations,\" she told journalists.\n\"If this issue is not resolved immediately the outcome of the election might be compromised.\"\nVoting was due to end at 18:00 local time (15:00 GMT) but has been extended by three hours in some areas because election materials arrived late.\nIn the capital, Addis Ababa, BBC reporters saw long queues of voters during the day. It is one area where Mr Abiy is expected to face a stiff challenge and where the opposition has succeeded in the past.\n\"I came here to contribute to the election which I believe could be a great milestone for democracy,\" Demiss Beyene, who started queuing two hours before polls opened, told the BBC.\n\"I believe the election will bring in peace... I really wish this election brings back our unity, instead of dividing us over ethnicity,\" Tadelech Benti, another voter in Addis Ababa, said.\nThe general election, the first since 2015, was originally slated for August 2020 but was rescheduled because of coronavirus.\nResults are expected within five days.\nMr Abiy came to power in 2018 as the nominee of the then-ruling coalition but he has never faced the electorate.\nHe became prime minister on the back of protests against the government dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and introduced a series of reforms. \nIn the last election, the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition and its allies won all the seats but Mr Abiy has dissolved the coalition and created a new party - the Prosperity Party - in an attempt to reduce ethnic division. The TPLF, however, did not join.\nMr Abiy will keep his post if the party wins a majority of the 547 seats in the national assembly. He says the polls will be \"the nation's first attempt at free and fair elections\".\nHis reformist zeal saw him win the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, but just a year later, he launched a military operation in his own country. He deployed troops to Tigray to oust the TPLF as the region's ruling party after it seized military bases in what Mr Abiy saw as a bid to overthrow him.\nIt resulted in a conflict that has killed thousands of people and has led to mass hunger and reports of a famine in the region.\nMore than 40 parties have fielded candidates but most of them are regional parties.\nOpposition parties have complained that a government crackdown against their officials disrupted their plans to prepare for the polls.\nCasting his vote, Berhanu Nega the leader of one of the main opposition parties, Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice, said he hoped the result would reflect the popular will.\n\"This doesn't mean there will not be problems. But the problems would not be significant enough to overturn or reflect what the public actually voted,\" he told journalists at the polling station.\nIn some pivotal regions, such as Oromia, opposition parties are boycotting the election, alleging government intimidation.\nThe TPLF has been designated a terrorist organisation. Some of its leaders have been arrested, while others are on the run or are continuing to wage a guerrilla war in Tigray.\nCatherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Beshasha village, Ethiopia\nIn the valley between rolling hills the local market in Beshasha village has been turned into a polling station for the day.\nThis is where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was born and grew up and he is hugely popular.\nBut there are two candidates running against Mr Abiy and they tell me that local officials have harassed their supporters and made it hard for them to campaign. Yet they're careful about how much they criticise the prime minister.\nSome of the country's biggest political parties have boycotted this election citing intimidation from the state. And some of Mr Abiy's biggest opponents on the national stage are in detention accused of trying to destabilise the country.\nDespite the fact that 20% of constituencies will not vote today the government is standing by today's vote and says it will be a genuine reflection of the will of Ethiopians.\nDespite being billed as a national contest, elections will not be held in around one-fifth of the country's 547 constituencies, including all 38 seats in Tigray and 64 others across Ethiopia.\nMost of the delayed votes are scheduled for 6 September though no date has been set yet for Tigray.\nThere are election observers from the African Union as well as a number of Ethiopian groups but the EU will not be sending a team. In May, the EU accused Ethiopia of failing to guarantee the independence of its mission.\nMr Abiy has dismissed international concern and has insisted the election will be free and fair.\n\"When the entire world is saying we will fight on election day, we will instead teach them a lesson,\" he told supporters at a rally last week."

      "tags": "Home Office",
      "text": "The government should drop its \"disproportionate\" plan to ban noisy protests in England and Wales, a parliamentary committee has warned.\nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would also introduce powers to deal with demonstrations involving only one person.\nThe Joint Committee on Human Rights said the legislation could undermine freedom of expression.\nBut the Home Office said it would not \"impinge\" on the right to protest.\nExisting laws are out of date and \"disruptive and dangerous tactics\" have to be dealt with, a spokeswoman added.\nThe committee's chairwoman, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, said the plans were \"oppressive and wrong\".\nThe bill says group protests should not be loud enough to cause \"serious unease, alarm or distress\" to people \"in the vicinity\".\nA noise limit would also apply to a single person if they caused \"serious disruption\" or if they \"may have a relevant impact on\" people nearby.\nIn a report highly critical of the bill, the committee, which advises MPs and peers on the compatibility of all government bills with human rights laws, called for \"statutory protection\" for the right to hold protests to be introduced.\nIt added that councils should be told to \"refrain from interfering unlawfully\" with them and be given \"the duty to facilitate protest\".\nThe report also said the language used in the bill left an \"excessive degree of judgement in the hands of a police officer\".\nAnd it described the proposed limits on single-person protests as \"unprecedented\".\nThis legislation comes after repeated city centre occupations by the Extinction Rebellion movement - and last year's toppling of the statue of a Bristol slave trader and municipal benefactor. \nThe committee said allowing police to set noise limits could silence lawful and peaceful chants - and the most popular demonstrations could face restrictions on duration and location, interfering with the right to assembly. \nIt also urges the government not to create powers to interfere with public demonstrations held by a single person and warns that a new crime of causing a public nuisance is too vague to be understood. \nMPs and peers don't need to act on the report, but the legislation has already triggered its own protests.\nAnd there are predictions it could lead to years of legal battles all the way to the Supreme Court.\nCommenting on the plans, committee chairwoman Ms Harman said: \"One of our most fundamental rights is to protest. It is the essence of our democracy.\n\"To do that, we need to make ourselves heard. The government proposals to allow police to restrict 'noisy' protests are oppressive and wrong.\"\nMPs have already backed the bill in principle and it is currently undergoing detailed scrutiny.\nIt also outlines stronger police powers to break up \"unauthorised encampments\" and longer sentences for people convicted of serious crimes.\nThe government said existing public order laws needed updating because \"the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics - including obstructing emergency vehicles or blocking the free press - costs millions to the taxpayer and causes misery to businesses and local communities\".\n\"The right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy,\" a Home Office spokeswoman said. \"Our proposed measures are in line with human rights legislation and in no way impinge on the right to protest.\"\nThe bill would allow police to \"better manage demonstrations so that legitimate protest groups can make their voices heard without disrupting the lives and livelihoods of others\", she added."

      "text": "A photograph has emerged which appears to show Princess Latifa, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, who has rarely been seen or heard from in months.\nThe Instagram post seems to show Princess Latifa with a friend at Madrid airport.\nIn February, the BBC broadcast footage shot by Princess Latifa in which she said she was being held captive in a villa and feared for her life.\nThe footage prompted the UN to demand \"concrete\" proof she was still alive. \nHuman rights experts from the UN also said she should be released \"urgently\".\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) later said she was \"being cared for at home\". \n\"She continues to improve and we are hopeful she will return to public life at the appropriate time,\" the statement said.\nThis latest image appeared on the public Instagram account of Sioned Taylor. It is the third photo that Ms Taylor, who lives in Dubai and is a long time friend, has posted of Princess Latifa since mid-May.\n\"Great European holiday with Latifa,\" the caption reads. \"We're having fun exploring!\" Both women are wearing face masks and appear to be in Madrid-Barajas airport in Spain's capital. \nDavid Haigh, co-founder of the Free Latifa campaign, said in a statement he was \"pleased to see Latifa seemingly having a passport, travelling and enjoying an increasing degree of freedom\".\nHe also said the princess had directly contacted members of the Free Latifa team, but added he could not comment further at this stage.\nIn May, Ms Taylor posted two other photos on Instagram which appeared to show Princess Latifa at a mall in Dubai and later at a restaurant in the city.\nOn the face of it, this does appear to be a marked improvement in Princess Latifa's situation. \nOnly four months ago, her video showed a captive woman clearly in some distress, and following its broadcast, her friends and supporters worried whether she was still alive. \nToday they are cautiously optimistic, but they remain wary, with several questions unanswered. \nWhat were the conditions under which she was allowed to travel? Is there a chaperone from her father's family lurking discreetly in the background and reporting back on her every movement? Does she have any say in whether she can travel again or return to what amounts to house arrest in Dubai? \nAs ever, there has been little or no comment from the authorities in Dubai. Commenting on her situation, one of her supporters said today: \"We will only know the answers when and if she is allowed to come to London as a free woman\".\nLatifa, one of the 25 children of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, attempted to escape from Dubai in February 2018. \nIn a video recorded shortly before she left, she said that her life was heavily constricted. \"I haven't left the country since 2000. I've been asking a lot to just go travelling, to study, to do anything normal. They don't let me,\" she said. \nBut the escape went wrong: eight days into a sea journey across the Indian Ocean, they were caught by commandoes who forcibly removed Latifa and returned her to Dubai. \nHer father later said that he considered this a \"rescue mission\".\nIn February 2021, BBC Panorama broadcast videos secretly recorded by Princess Latifa and communicated to friends abroad, in which she describes her capture and her imprisonment after her return to Dubai. \nShe said she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police.

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm a delay to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland later.\nThe first minister signalled last week the move to level zero - the lowest in the five-tier system - was likely to be pushed back by three weeks.\nOriginally set for 28 June, it could be delayed until at least mid-July so more people can be vaccinated.\nMs Sturgeon has also promised to publish a much-anticipated review of social distancing rules.\nShe is expected to give an indication of what life could look like once the country has transitioned to level zero and beyond.\nWhile large parts of Scotland moved into level one earlier this month, and some islands went down to level zero, many parts of the central belt remain in level two, where there are stricter limits on the size of groups that can meet.\nThe first minister has previously indicated that it was unlikely any area would move down a level on 28 June.\nInstead, she suggested the current level of restrictions was likely to remain until 19 July - the same date Prime Minister Boris Johnson has targeted as a \"terminus\" for England's lockdown restrictions. \nIn Wales, lockdown rules are being reviewed again on 15 July, while the next planned easing in Northern Ireland is set for 5 July.\nMs Sturgeon is expected to update MSPs in a statement to the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood at about 14:20 BST on Tuesday.\nThe number of Covid cases in Scotland has been steadily rising since early May.\nAnother 1,250 new Covid cases were reported in Scotland on Monday, 7.2% of all the new tests taken.\nFigures showed there were 158 people in hospital with a recently confirmed case of Covid, with 14 of those needing intensive care.\nMs Sturgeon said last week that the reason for the likely pause in easing restrictions was to \"buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus\".\n\"Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave,\" she added.\nBy Monday morning, 3,647,437 people in Scotland had received the first dose of the Covid vaccination, with 2,586,970 having received their second dose.\nMs Sturgeon said on Friday that all adults in Scotland should have been offered a first dose of the vaccine by the end of this week, and all adults will have received a first dose by 18 July - almost two weeks ahead of schedule.\nThe likely delay to ending restrictions has already been criticised by the hospitality industry, which has warned of the potential of \"another lost summer\".\nMembers of the Scottish travel industry will also lobby both Holyrood and the Westminster parliaments this week urging greater support.\nOn Monday they sent an open letter accusing the first minister of \"banning\" them from operating - other than \"in name only\" - with impractical Covid rules. \nBefore her latest Covid statement on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon will face a topical question at Holyrood from Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson, asking on what basis the government has introduced a ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford.\nMs Sturgeon defended the ban on Monday after an angry reaction from Greater Manchester's mayor, Andy Burnham. She insisted it was a public health measure based on Covid levels in the area.\nMr Burnham condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban, and called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

We were really excited about it and then suddenly find out we are not able to go.\"\nMiss Godiff said it \"seems unfair\" particularly when she has had two Covid vaccinations and her partner has had his first dose.\nShe said she was hoping to get a refund on the \u00a3400 they have paid for their accommodation.\nMiss Godiff said she had yet to break the news to the couple's three-year-old daughter who has not stopped talking about going to Scotland and going on an open-top bus in Edinburgh.\nManchester and Salford were in the top ten areas with the highest number of Covid cases in England in the week up to 16 June. \nManchester has 347 cases per 100,000 people, while Salford has 335.\nNon-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen on 24 May, while travel restrictions with Bedford were lifted on Friday.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "A burglar has been jailed for breaking into the home of an 89-year-old stroke patient who watched helplessly as he stole her jewellery.\nDean Lennox took the widow's wedding ring and late husband's wallet from her supported accommodation in Torquay, Devon last month.\nLennox, 40, of Torquay, admitted burglary and was jailed for three years and four months at Exeter Crown Court.\nThe judge told him his crime left the victim \"scared and fearful\".\nThe woman, who is incapable of speech or movement, woke up during the burglary and CCTV from her bedroom showed her eyes following Lennox's movements.\nLennox sold the ring and other jewellery at a local shop for \u00a345 a few hours later and dumped the wallet outside after finding nothing worth stealing inside.\nThe victim's daughter told the court her mother now struggles to sleep and spends hours awake trying to look around her room.\nLennox targeted the supported accommodation in Torquay after scouting it earlier in the day while posing as a window cleaner, and discovering the flats were all occupied by vulnerable elderly women.\nJudge David Evans told him: \"This is one of the worst domestic burglaries I have seen for a long time. The victim had suffered a stroke and was immobile and mute.\n\"She was able to look on in what must have been terror and you burgled her property and she was utterly helpless to do anything about it.\n\"She is in the twilight of her life and you have left her scared and fearful in her disabled state.\" \nThe court heard Lennox tried to sabotage security cameras but one filmed him searching the bedroom and sent the images to the victim's daughter's phone, where she found them when she woke up.\nLennox stole \u00a390 cash and three rings, which he sold at a jewellery shop to get money to buy drugs.\nMiss Kelly Scrivener, defending, said Lennox is ashamed of his actions and determined to overcome his drug problems while in prison.\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "It is \"sad if girls can't be proud of being girls\", England's chief inspector of schools has said, after a London school said it was renaming the role of head girl.\nAmanda Spielman said she wanted to ensure that the \"power\" of being a woman \"doesn't get lost\".\nSt Paul's Girls' School said it would rename the role to \"head of school\" in part because of \"binary connotations\".\nStaff told the Times it sent a damaging message.\nAsked about the report on BBC Radio 4's Woman Hour, Ms Spielman said: \"I just hope that St Paul's Girls' School and every other girls' school can carry on encouraging most of their girls - of course there will always be a few exploring their sexuality, exploring gender - but let's hope that girls can carry on being proud of being girls.\"\nOfsted's chief inspector added: \"I'd just like to make sure that the power and strength of girls and being a woman - growing into being a woman - doesn't get lost in our society, it's so important .\"\nMs Spielman, who attended the sixth form at St Paul's, said \"heated\" discussions about sex and gender were \"probably making it a bit harder for young people to grow up\".\nAsked whether there was a generational gap, she said young people tended to be \"the most radical\".\n\"Who knows whether there is a genuine intergenerational change, or whether it's just another manifestation of that strength and intensity that it's absolutely right that we want young people to have, that will moderate with time. I simply don't know,\" she said.\nShe also said it was important to \"talk about children in natural language\", after the Daily Telegraph reported that LGBT group Stonewall wanted teachers to start using the term \"learners\" rather than \"boys\" and \"girls\".\nMs Spielman said the term \"can make it easy to forget that there are real-life children and young people underneath\".\n\"The more we shift away from the kinds of words that mothers, fathers, children, teachers naturally use the more remote things get and the harder it is for people to think about them,\" she said.\nSt Paul's said there was \"no intention of diminishing the role we play in educating and empowering young women to be proud of who they are and the equal of anyone\".\nIn a statement, the school said students had raised questions about the name \"head girl\" this year. They wanted it to be more inclusive and felt the term \"girls\" was not appropriate for 17- and 18-year-old students, it said.\nIt added that head girls were originally called \"heads of the school\" so \"we are acting fully in line with our ethos,\"\nSt Paul's said there was \"no intention to change the name of the school or seek to erase the word 'girls' or undermine its value in any way\"."

      "text": "Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accused the Scottish government of \"hypocrisy\" after it announced a travel ban to parts of the region.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday that non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford would be banned from Monday.\nMr Burnham said the decision was \"announced out of the blue\" and was \"completely disproportionate\".\nThe Scottish government said it was made after \"careful consideration\". \nA spokesman said Scottish rules on travel were \"kept under active review\" and could \"sometimes happen at short notice\" after receiving the latest data.\nHe added Covid rates in Manchester and Salford were \"particularly high at the moment and these restrictions are intended to minimise the risk of either exacerbating the situation there or indeed allowing more virus to come back here to Scotland\".\nThe decision to add Manchester and Salford was announced in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday.\nMr Burnham said different arrangements could have been made \"if the first minister had been in touch with us\".\nHe said he would write to Ms Sturgeon and ask the Scottish government to compensate local people who had planned to travel to Scotland and businesses that could lose bookings.\nNon-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen on 24 May, while travel restrictions with Bedford were lifted on Friday.\nThe pandemic has shone a light on devolved decision making across the UK.\nScottish ministers have flexed their legislative muscles to at times take a different approach to Downing Street when it comes to tackling the spread of Covid.\nThe UK government's decision last year to impose tougher restrictions on Greater Manchester sparked more debate over regional devolution, and prompted an angry response from the mayor Andy Burnham.\nNow he's turned that anger towards the first minister, arguing Nicola Sturgeon's doing to Greater Manchester what she has criticised UK Ministers for doing to Scotland - taking decisions without consultation or warning.\nThe Scottish government insists the travel ban was carefully considered, and that as the virus moves fast, so must the government.\nA flexing of devolved powers not everyone is happy about.\nOn Sunday, the UK recorded another 9,284 Covid cases - including 7,778 cases for England and 1,205 for Scotland - and a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nBoth nations have seen a rise in the the seven-day infection rate with the Scottish infection rate at 128 per 100,000 people and 86 per 100,000 people in England.\nNearly 43 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus vaccine, while 31.3 million of them have had their second jab - 59.5% of the adult population - according to latest government figures.\nNorth-west England had the highest proportion of people in England who are likely to test positive for the virus in the week to 12 June, at a rate of about one in 180\nScotland, which has the highest infection rate in Europe but also one of the highest vaccination rates, has paused the lifting of Covid restrictions this summer due to rising cases.\nAppearing on BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Burnham said: \"I was really disappointed on Friday that the first minister of Scotland just announced out of the blue - as far as we were concerned - a travel ban saying that people couldn't travel from Scotland to Manchester and Salford, and people couldn't go the other way.\n\"That is exactly what the SNP always accuse the Westminster government of doing - riding roughshod over people.\n\"The SNP are treating the north of England with the same contempt in bringing that in without any consultation with us.\"\nHe added: \"I just think it's double standards, it's hypocrisy.\n\"Why should a couple from Salford - who are double jabbed - who are about to go on a walking holiday in Scotland, not be able to go?\n\"The Scottish government can't just impose things on parts of the north of England with no discussion with us - that is simply wrong and they need to live by the same standards that they always call from others.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Scottish government trade minister Ivan McKee said a decision had to be made quickly.\n\"The virus, as we know, moves very fast, decisions are made very fast and those decisions are communicated at a four-nations level,\" he said.\nHe said Mr Burnham's decision to write to the first minister was \"absolutely fine and I'm sure there will be a conversation about how we can keep him better informed in future\".\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "title": "Covid: Music and comedy venue changes in Wales lockdown easing",
      "tags": "Wales business,Live music,Cardiff,Newport,Pubs,Music",
      "text": "Covid capacity rules in music and comedy venues have been slightly relaxed in another minor easing of Wales' lockdown restrictions.\nThe number of guests attending wedding receptions and wakes has also changed in Wales on Monday, allowing venues to host as many people as they can safely.\nWales' first minister said he will pause major relaxations for four weeks due to the start of a third Covid wave.\nRules for music and comedy venues are now \"in line\" with hospitality venues.\nSo, like pubs and restaurants, the changes mean groups of six people from six households can attend music and comedy venues in Wales.\nNow numbers allowed into each venue will be based on its size instead of being limited to 30 as businesses must follow strict Covid guidelines, like having one-way systems and appropriate ventilation.\nBut while welcoming the amendments, there are worries in Wales' music industry that operating with social distancing in place could make it \"not economically viable\" for venues.\nRapper Eggsy, a member of Newport hip hop group Goldie Lookin Chain, is worried for small venues and fears live local music won't be back until 2022.\n\"Our gigs have been pushed back and back,\" he said.\n\"Will venues be able to make a profit with reduced crowds? That will affect who they are booking.\n\"You might be able to get a few local bands that won't cost a lot but getting bands in and making a profit will be hard.\"\nGLC, who have had three top 20 hits, are planning on an autumn tour in 2021 which includes seven Welsh dates.\nBut Eggsy, real name John Rutledge, admits: \"I don't think live music will be back on for a long time, next year at the earliest. I hope I am wrong, but it is still looking crazy.\n\"But hopefully these changes in the rules will give small venues a bit of a breather and a chance to make a bit of money.\"\nMark Drakeford wanted \"grassroots\" music venues - like Clwb Ifor Bach in Cardiff, Swansea's Sin City and Pavilion Mid Wales in Llandrindod Wells - to come \"in line\" with rest of the hospitality sector.\nWhile the Music Venue Trust \"appreciate\" the slight easing of restrictions from Wales' first minister, the organisation that represents 50 gig venues in Wales is concerned.\n\"It's not economically viable,\" said chief executive Mark Davyd.\n\"Venues will be doing it to reconnect with customers. It is good news everything is moving forward. Not as fast as we would like but we appreciate everything Mark Drakeford has done.\n\"But how many venues will be able to open in Wales is a slightly different question, because they still have to do social distancing.\"\nHe thinks some venues might \"try to do two shows a day instead of one\" in an attempt to turn a profit.\n\"They also might try and introduce seated food gigs, so it will be more like a dining experience,\" said Mr Davyd.\nHe said venues \"need to make sure that that what we are doing makes sense\" as they wanted \"to drive toward full capacity reopening\". \nNewport's Le Pub is also a well-known small music venue and its manger Sam Dabb thinks the new guidance is \"sensible\".\n\"The last guidance that brought in a weird caveat that put even places like the Tramshed (capacity 1,000 people) at a maximum of 30 people,\" she said.\n\"It's sensible and I think it is perfectly safe because it is set by assessing venue size.\n\"I think what they now need to do is work on the fact that event guidance for large events, like in Cardiff Castle.\"\nRules covering wedding and civil partnerships receptions and wakes in Wales will also change on Monday and there will no longer be limits on numbers at weddings.\nFollowing a risk assessment by venues, the first minister said numbers will be based on how many can be \"safely accommodated\".\nMr Drakeford said changes meant venues would move away from having a notional number, adding: \"If those can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do.\"\nHe added it would mean \"at quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now\".\nPilot events in theatre, sport and other sectors will also continue through June and July ahead of Wales' next lockdown rules review on 15 July.\nThe other amendment to Wales' rules is that primary school children in the same school contact group or bubble will be able to stay overnight in a residential outdoor education centre.
