      "tags": "Schools,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Secondary schools in England will be asked to consider delivering face-to-face summer schools as part of efforts to help pupils catch up.\nAn extra \u00a3400m in funding has been announced, along with \u00a3300m announced for catch-up projects in January.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the money will help ensure \"no child is left behind\" due to the pandemic.\nTeachers, experts and unions called the money a \"good start\" - but warned about overwhelming pupils and teachers.\nThe prime minister has confirmed all pupils will return to classrooms from 8 March as part of the first step of a roadmap for easing England's lockdown. \nWith secondary school pupils being asked to take three Covid-19 tests in school when they come back, it is likely that secondary schools will have to stagger the return over a few days.\nAs part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year.\nThe government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said \"we're giving schools the option to be able to draw down on this funding\".\nHe said the average primary school will also receive around \u00a36,000 in extra money, with the average secondary school getting around \u00a322,000 extra in recovery premium payments.\nIt would be up to head teachers to decide how to use the money - it could be used, for example to pay teachers for overtime to do extra teaching.\nThe government's \u00a3700m education support package for England includes:\nLast year, Mr Johnson announced a \u00a31bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner.\nIn Scotland, the administration has promised \u00a3140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to \"help boost growth\" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nChief secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay, said communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would now all benefit from at least \u00a3800m of investment for town centre and high street regeneration, local transport, cultural and heritage projects. \nOn the subject of masks in schools, Mr Williamson said the policy of secondary pupils in England having to wear face coverings in classrooms would be reviewed over the Easter holiays. Most pupils will have to wear face coverings indoors, including in classrooms where social distancing isn't possible.\nHe did not rule out that the policy could remain in place until 21 June, which is the final date in plans to ease lockdown. \nThe government had considered a variety of options for pupils - including extended school days and shorter summer holidays - but neither of these proposals form part of the plan set out on Wednesday.\nAsked whether extending the school day could be among future measures, Mr Williamson told Sky News: \"We'll be looking at how we can boost and support children in a whole range of different manners.\n\"But it's not just about time in school it's about supporting teachers in terms of the quality of teaching and how we can help them.\"\nExams this year have already been cancelled in England, but Mr Williamson said more detail on how grades will be calculated is expected on Thursday. \nMother-of-three Emily Ellarby says her children are \"jaded\" by online learning and are ready to be back at school. But she says it would be \"hard to get them motivated\" for more school over the summer. \"They're looking forward to the summer holidays and having a proper break.\" \nShe says ultimately children just want to get back to school and normal life. \"They're quite keen to go back, they're looking forward to seeing their friends, they want that normality.\"\nFather-of-two Nick Lee says children and teachers need a proper summer break, not more schooling. \"My children have suffered enough with this pandemic and they will not attend any summer camps.\n\"We have all struggled to cope in these hard times, and stealing my children's summer is not the way to go.\"\nSarah Baker, who has two children and a stepchild, says she is \"torn\" over the idea of catch-up lessons in the summer.\n\"They're all at really critical stages in their education, but they're also at critical stages in their personal development. So, I'm completely torn. Yes, of course, they need to catch up, but they also need to regroup.\"\nAnd Sarah Webb, who has three children aged 11, eight and five, said children need time to recover from the past year, rather than more academic pressure.\n\"These children have missed out on social interaction and now need time to help readjust and come to terms with their experiences, not being given more time and pressure to bring them back up to academic standards that can simply no longer apply to them.\"\nKate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the new funding \"will not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost\".\n\"There is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing, which is fundamental to enabling their recovery from this pandemic,\" she said.\nLabour also calculated the new package was worth less than the \u00a3840m spent on the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last year, and would be worth 43p per pupil per day, if the money was split across a normal school year.\nSchool leaders' unions welcomed the funding but also warned of a long road ahead. \nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT - which represents head teachers - said summer schools \"will be of value for some pupils but it will be important not to overwhelm students\".\nChris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, said any provision needed to focus on children's \"physical wellbeing, and social and emotional development\", but he also expressed concern about teacher morale.\nHe said asking teachers, who were \"facilitating both in-class teaching and remote learning\", to work over the summer break was likely to \"exacerbate low morale\".\nBy Dan Johnson, BBC News \nJust working out how to measure what each child has missed during the pandemic is tricky, let alone agreeing on the best way to address it and make sure they all achieve their potential. \nMany teachers are wary of talking about \"catching-up\" and pupils being \"left behind\" - they do not want to discourage young people. \nBut there is widespread recognition that home learning could never fully replace classroom teaching and some pupils will need significant extra support when they get back to classrooms.\nThe government is backing one-to-one and small group tuition, alongside summer school activities. \nSuggestions of a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday have not materialised. \nMany teachers feel they can best assess what their pupils need, but after a relentless year, they are tired and need help in some form. \nHow that help is given and whether it reaches the right pupils will determine the lasting impact on the lives of children who've been through the most difficult school year."

      "text": "Apple has acquired about 100 companies over the last six years, the company\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook has revealed.\nThat works out at a company every three to four weeks, he told Apple\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. \nApple recently delivered its largest quarter by revenue of all time, bringing in $111.4bn (\u00a378.7bn) in the first-quarter of its fiscal year 2021.\nMr Cook told the shareholders meeting that the acquisitions are mostly aimed at acquiring technology and talent. \nApple's largest acquisition in the last decade was its $3bn purchase of Beats Electronics, the headphone maker founded by rapper and producer Dr Dre.  \nAnother high profile purchase was music recognition software company Shazam, for $400m in 2018.  \nMost often, Apple buys smaller technology firms and then incorporates their innovations into its own products. \nOne example is PrimeSense, an Israeli 3D sensing company whose technology contributed to Apple\u2019s FaceID. \nApple has also invested in back-end technology that wouldn\u2019t be so obvious to iPhone or Macbook users.\nApple's list of acquisitions and investments is extremely varied. \nIn the past year, Apple has bought several artificial intelligence (AI) companies, a virtual reality events business, a payments startup and a podcast business, among others. \nIn 2019, Apple bought Drive.ai, a self-driving shuttle firm, in an effort to boost its own foray into self-driving technologies. \nIn 2016, the company also took a $1bn stake in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, although it wasn\u2019t a controlling interest. \nApple is an immensely profitable juggernaut worth more than $2trn, so it has plenty of money to make acquisitions. \nBut even if it has bought 100 companies in six years, Apple appears to be very selective about what it buys. \nFor example, Tesla founder Elon Musk recently revealed that he approached Mr Cook to buy the electric car business when it was struggling in 2013. \nMr Cook didn't take the meeting, Mr Musk said.  \nMeasured by value, Apple\u2019s acquisitions are actually far more restrained than those of many of its tech rivals. \nMicrosoft paid $26bn for LinkedIn, Amazon paid $13.7bn for Whole Foods and Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp.\nApple\u2019s ten largest purchases put together would still be worth far less than any of those deals."

      "text": "Everyone on the GP learning disability register should be prioritised for a Covid vaccine, the joint committee on vaccination has advised the government.\nThis means 150,000 people at higher risk with severe disabilities will be offered a jab more quickly in England.\nBut those with mild learning disabilities should not expect to be prioritised.\nIt follows DJ Jo Whiley's plea for people such as her sister, Frances, to be vaccinated as quickly as possible.\nWhiley was offered the vaccine before her sister, who has a rare genetic syndrome and lives in residential care.\nThe broadcaster's sister is recovering after being admitted to hospital with coronavirus earlier this week.\n\"This is a great day, I am so relieved. I'm so happy for all those people who have been living in fear,\" Jo Whiley said, adding that it was \"very difficult\" to categorise people according to their disability.\nThe charity Mencap said everyone with a learning disability should check they are on the register and, if not, ask to go on it.\nPeople with a \"severe or profound\" learning disability in England and Wales were already in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine, along with unpaid carers for those with disabilities and the elderly.\nAnd adults with Down's Syndrome have already been offered a jab, in priority group 4, as part of the UK's target to vaccinate 15 million people by mid-February.\nNow everyone on their GP's learning disability register will be invited for vaccination as part of priority group six, Public Health England has confirmed, regardless of how severe their disability is.\nAnd the NHS is being asked to work with local authorities to identify other adults, in residential care or receiving support to live in the community, who are severely affected by a learning disability and may not be registered, but who should be offered a vaccine.\nIt comes after an analysis found that people registered with their GP as having a learning disability, who tend to be those at the more severe end, are more at risk of being seriously ill and dying from Covid.  \nThere are 1.2 million people with a learning disability in England - but only a quarter to a third of them, or 250,000, are thought to be on the GP learning disability register.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said all those with severe learning disabilities were \"very disadvantaged\" and should be reached out to - but he said including people with mild learning disabilities was not recommended because they were at no greater risk than someone else of the same age.\nSpeaking in front of a committee of MPs, he said he didn't want lots of families who might be concerned about their relative with a mild learning disability to start contacting GPs and \"overwhelming them\".\nHowever, Nicola Sturgeon announced that Scotland would prioritise all people with learning disabilities in group six on Monday. She said priority group six would be expanded to include those with mild or moderate learning disabilities.\nA report from Public Health England in November found that people with a learning disability were up to six times more likely to die from Covid-19 and, in the 18-34 age group, their risk was 30 times higher.\nThe charity Mencap said the announcement was \"fantastic news for people with a learning disability\".\n\"It's now crucially important that everyone with a learning disability checks that they are on the register and asks to go on it if they are not,\" said the charity's Jackie O'Sullivan.\n\"Being on the register has many benefits and entitles people to annual health checks and prioritisation for future vaccinations, as well as allowing them to get the Covid vaccine and be confident they are protected.\"\nHelen Whately, minister for care in England, said everyone who is on the GP's learning disability register would be invited for vaccination to protect those at higher risk from the virus. \n\"I have heard first-hand how tough this pandemic has been for people with learning disabilities and their families,\" she said. \n\"We are determined those more at risk from Covid should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\" "

It was too early in the morning to say I had been drinking.\n\"Haydn and I had engaged in considerable email communications and Haydn's were always long and verbose and quite trying to read at different times, and this was the culmination of a long series of communications which had probably tried my patience.\"\nAfter a meeting where Haydn Lewis was present, Mr Stevens wrote to a colleague: \"What a monumental waste of time, not just this afternoon, but all the previous hours spent nurturing that group of moaners.\"\nMr Stevens told the inquiry it had been a difficult meeting with people who wanted more services from the Macfarlane Trust than the organisation had the funds to achieve.\n\"They expressed their anger at us rather than the government and, in the end, it became trying on our patience to listen to personal attacks,\" he said. \"I was accused of lying, but I didn't know what about.\"\nWhen asked if it was his view that the participants in the meeting were \"a waste of time and moaners\" Mr Stevens told the inquiry: \"Not all the time - some of the time.\"\nMr Stevens was also asked about another email where he was discussing whether or not the trust should provide the same level of support for other family members of haemophiliacs who had also contracted HIV.\nIn it he wrote: \"That would be a way of pissing off the Lewis contingent.\"\nHe admitted that he knew that Haydn's wife had been infected with HIV but told the inquiry: \"I was simply saying it as a throwaway remark to a friend.\"\nHe denied that the communications showed \"distain or contempt\" for the beneficiaries of the Macfarlane Trust.\nThe trust, which had been initially established by the government, was wound up in 2017.

      "text": "Businesses have called for more clarity on the easing of Covid lockdown restrictions. \nIt comes after the first minister set out her plans on Tuesday for the country and businesses to reopen between now and April. \nHowever, it will be mid-March before more details are spelled out. \nThe Scottish government said non-essential retail, hospitality and services such as gyms and hairdressers would not reopen before 26 April. \nFrom then, Scotland will return to using a levels system of restrictions, where the level in each area is determined by prevalence of the virus.\nAll parts of the country currently in level four are expected to be able to move back to level three initially. \nThe government has warned there may be some changes to what is allowed in each level. \nDuring Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she \"desperately wanted\" to give a date for the overall end of lockdown, as the prime minister has done for 21 June, but said she did not want to give people \"false clarity\".\nShe said: \"If I were to give you a fixed and hard and fast date right now, I would pretty much be making it up and I don't think that's the approach I should take.\n\"Our approach here is not an outlier and in terms of reopening the economy, we are roughly two weeks behind England.\"\nTanja Lister of the Kylesku Hotel in Sutherland told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that a return to the levels system would be devastating for business. \nShe said: \"Effectively what we've been given is a route map to another lockdown, because let's be clear - level three for us, which is what's on for April, is actually what closed most hotels in the last part of 2020 so for our industry it's a potential disaster.\" \nMs Lister added: \"If you were booking a holiday right now somewhere in the UK, you wouldn't book it in Scotland and that's the point. \n\"If you were looking for a job right now somewhere in the UK, you wouldn't look for it in Scotland. \n\"We will be left with very very serious problems in the summer is this doesn't change soon.\"\nMs Lister set up the hospitality and tourism action group, which is campaigning for a UK-wide full unlocking and reopening of the tourism and hospitality industry on 17 May - in line with the date set out for England on Monday. \nIn a statement, the group said the announcement on how the unlocking would take place in Scotland had been met with \"utter dismay, confusion and anger\". \nIt added that the industry in Scotland faced the green shoots of recovery for 2021 dying, adding: \"Rather than cautious hope, the industry now faces widespread cancellations as people make plans to head elsewhere in the UK, recruitment becomes almost impossible.\"\nDuring her speech on Tuesday, the first minister stressed that Scotland's route out of lockdown was dependent on suppression of the virus.\nMs Sturgeon acknowledged that she was being \"deliberately cautious\", but said the pace of easing restrictions would be accelerated if the data supported it.\nOn Monday, Boris Johnson announced that shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality in England could reopen on 12 April.\nUnder a four-step plan to ease lockdown south of the border, all legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June if strict conditions are met.\nStephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, said it was not viable for hospitality businesses to open under level three restrictions. \nHe added that it would be better if hospitality could be given definitive dates for reopening in the spring, like those given in England.  \n\"We know on the 26 April that we're going to be open in some way - that's a date that we can look forward to, but we don't know whether it's going to be outside trading or inside trading, we don't know whether we're going to be serving food, no alcohol, nothing. \n\"We've got skilled staff to rehire, we have trading to do, we need some dates as indicative as they may be, but something to look forward to.\" \nHe also said the 18:00 curfew that was in place under the old system effectively meant stopping taking orders at 16:30, which prevented them effectively operating an evening service. \nFiona Campbell, of the Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers, said the Scottish government had \"failed completely\" to set out what the changes would mean for hospitality and tourism businesses. \nShe added: \"What makes this muddle even more disappointing to us, and to Scotland's tourism sector as a whole, is that it effectively means we are lagging behind our colleagues south of the border who already have an indicative date to reopen and as a result have already seen bookings come pouring in for late spring. \n\"We are now not only having to cancel and refund existing bookings, but we are also having to turn down bookings from south of the border.\"\nShe added that the self-catering sector had not yet had any help from sectoral support packages announced in December. \nNicola Sturgeon said she wanted to make sure that relaxing restrictions was \"as safe and sustainable as possible\", hence she wanted to be \"cautious, careful and patient for the next period - while the vaccination programme progresses\". \nShe added that she had tried to provide as much clarity as possible, while \"avoiding giving false assurance or picking arbitrary dates that have no grounding at this stage in any objective assessment\".\nBut Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said that the hospitality industry was \"crying out for information\". \nMr Ross added: \"They tuned in yesterday to the first minister to hear how we will get out of this, how we can return business to normal, how I'll be able to go round to my parents and give them a hug again - that's what we wanted from the first minister yesterday and we got none of that. \n\"She let Scotland down yesterday with that route map.\" \nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

At least six people from two households should be able to meet together outdoors, and communal worship will be allowed to resume.\nThe timing of major religious festivals - such as Easter - will be taken into account when deciding the exact date.\nThe levels system of restrictions would then be reintroduced from 26 April, along with a \"more substantial\" reopening of society and the economy.\n\"It is important to stress, of course, that all of this depends on us continuing to suppress the virus now - and continuing to accept some trade-offs for a period, for example on international travel,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\n\"However, if we do so, I am optimistic that we can make good progress in returning more normality to our lives and the economy.\"\nAnalysis by Lucy Whyte, BBC Scotland education correspondent\nScotland may have been among the first of the four nations to get any pupils in class, but it looks like it could be one of the last to have all pupils back to in-person learning.\nThis plan could see more children, especially primary pupils, allowed back in the classroom by 15 March, a week after England.\nBut the full return of Scotland's schools might not happen until a month later.\nThe decision to stick with a phased approach will be welcomed by teaching unions, who will also be glad to see the inclusion of blended learning initially for senior pupils.\nThe 5 April date for the potential full return to class is at the start of the Easter holidays for most, so really we are talking about the middle of that month before everyone is back.\nWill the first minister go faster? She has made clear that she will if she can, and there is a precedent when she accelerated the full return to school in August last year.\nOn that occasion she could demonstrate that numbers were on her side.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, said the statement \"fell short of public expectations\".\n\"We didn't get information about when measures like social distancing will end and when we will be able to do something as basic as give a loved one a hug,\" she said.\n\"Everyone understands that we might not be able to give people absolute certainty - but they were at least expecting the first minister to give them some kind of hope. \n\"Nothing has been published about what happens after 26 April. This isn't a route map out of Covid, it is holding document.\"\nMs Sturgeon said dates became \"more arbitrary\" the further you looked into the future.\n\"It is like putting your finger in the wind and coming up with a date that is not firmly based in the evidence,\" she said.\nScottish Labour's interim leader, Jackie Baillie, said the statement lacked clarity on its \"ultimate goal\".\nShe also called for a revised testing strategy which includes mass community testing where appropriate.\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie voiced concern that vaccine passports were \"slowly gaining traction\" and said: \"We don't want a two tier society which would exacerbate inequalities.\"\nScottish Green Party co-leader Patrick Harvie also raised fears that vaccine passports could make social inequality worse.\nTracy Black, director of CBI Scotland, said many Scottish businesses would be \"left feeling deflated\" as there was still \"considerable uncertainty\" about how and when they could reopen their doors.\nShe said businesses recognised it was right to take a cautious approach, but \"will have been looking for more detail than the partial timetable that has been provided\".\nLiz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: \"It is important that Scotland remains as closely in step with the four nations as is possible.\n\"A competitive disadvantage to business communities elsewhere in the UK will only add insult to the injury already caused by the pandemic.\" \nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level.\nIn the wake of the Ebola epidemic, and now Covid-19, having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding.\nThis also has implications for tracking maternal and child mortality as there are children whose birth and untimely death go unrecorded.\nThis not only robs them of a \"right to an identity\", in the words of William Muhwava - the head of demography at the UNECA based in Addis Ababa - it also means that lessons are not learnt. \n\"In order to help the living, we need to count the dead,\" UN Population Fund demographer Romesh Silva told the BBC. \nThose who are missed out on the registers are often the poorest and socially excluded, he adds, and the absence of information about their deaths means that measures to deal with the causes are sometimes not taken.\n\"Despite investments, CRVS systems remain dysfunctional, forcing governments to rely on surveys... which by the time they are published are already outdated,\" says Irina Dincu, from the Centre of Excellence for CRVS systems.\nWhen it comes to coronavirus there is a concern that its true extent in some countries is not fully understood.\nIt has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world.  \nExpertise in epidemic control, a swift response in some countries, the relatively young population and cross-immunity from other coronaviruses are all thought to have had an impact.\nBut data scientists say that calculating a key indicator of the pandemic's fallout - known as \"excess deaths\" - is impossible in most countries because of the lack of CRVS systems. \nExcess deaths is a measure which compares the actual deaths over a period of time with the number of deaths expected based on the same period in previous years. But it relies on the full registration of deaths.\nLooking at excess deaths gives a sense of the overall loss of life caused directly by Covid-19.\nIt also shows deaths caused indirectly by the pandemic because of factors such as overstretched health systems, fear of attending hospital and an economic downturn. \nA Lancet study across 118 low-income and middle-income countries estimated that the continued disruption of health systems from Covid-19 could result in 1,157,000 additional child deaths and 56,700 additional maternal deaths. \nSouth Africa and Egypt are among the eight countries which do have functioning death registers, so calculating excess deaths in both countries is possible, and the results are telling. \nBy early February, South Africa had recorded nearly 138,000 excess deaths since the pandemic began - that is almost three times the official figure given for Covid-19 deaths. \nTo break it down: 46,200 of these people were officially recorded as having died with coronavirus and there are death certificates to prove it. \nThis means the other 91,500 were either undiagnosed, or died as an indirect consequence of the pandemic such as delayed cancer treatment or fear of going to hospital. \nAt the height of the pandemic in late last July, South Africa experienced 54% more deaths than was expected for that time period.\nAlthough when the lockdown was first imposed, fewer deaths were recorded than normal, presumably because of fewer cases of alcohol-related violence and road accidents.\nThanks to Egypt's comprehensive registration system, it is possible to calculate that there were more than 68,000 excess deaths between May and August last year. \nIn June, the number of recorded deaths was almost double what would usually be expected. \nOn average, official Covid-19 deaths made up under 10% of those additional losses. \nBut for most countries on the continent there is no way to reach any conclusions like this as the data is so sparse. \nIn 14 countries a maximum of only one in 10 deaths are recorded, including in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon.\nOver half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa only keep handwritten death records.\nCertain states, such as Eritrea and Burundi, have no legal requirement to register or collate deaths at all. \nEritrea has recorded only seven Covid-19 death to date and Burundi, just three, although there was speculation that the virus was a contributing factor in the unexpected death of Burundi's former President Pierre Nkurunziza last year. \nNigeria, Africa's most populous country, recorded only 10% of all deaths in 2017. \nThe pandemic further \"paralysed all the civil registration activities\" in the country, which were not deemed an essential service, according to a UN report in April 2020. \nThis could explain why the number of Covid-19 deaths per million people remains relatively low there. \nNigeria has recorded nine Covid-19 deaths per million, compared to the global average of 316.\nMeanwhile, South Africa has recorded 827 Covid-19 deaths per million and Tunisia 659 - the two highest in Africa.\nBut it is important to take into account that these countries have good registers that capture most deaths - 92% and 95% of the population, respectively.\nThe BBC and UNECA's research has created the most up to date and comprehensive assessments of the death registration systems on the continent. \nIt was also discovered that many countries are making progress in bridging the data gap.\nThe Central African Republic (CAR) has one of the lowest performing CRVS systems on the continent following years of conflict, which is still ongoing. \nIn 2017 only 2% of estimated deaths were registered in the country. Twice as many male deaths were recorded as female -  and then only in the capital, Bangui, and its outskirts.\nElvis Franck Matkoss, head of the statistics department at the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Co-operation, told the BBC that \"the government attaches particular importance to CRVS and its fundamental role in promoting good governance\".  \nHe added that the CAR was making great efforts to improve on its 2% coverage through the modernisation of registration centres and the creation of a more centralised system. \nMr Matkoss said the government was also providing funding to help communities register their dead, as well as promoting free birth certificates for all children. \nSenegal and Rwanda are both working with a US non-profit organisation, Vital Strategies, to put together historic mortality data that can be compared to deaths during the pandemic - using a method called \"rapid mortality surveillance\". \nFive other countries - Togo, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana - are working with the African Field Epidemiology Network to do the same.\nChad and Liberia are asking community health workers to notify the authorities about deaths that occur outside of hospitals.\nThey are using \"verbal autopsies\" - interviewing next of kin about the deceased - a low-cost solution to understand major causes of death in a specific region.\nSome countries are using mobile technology to collect, manage and archive data about deaths.\nIn Rwanda and Mozambique, people can use smartphones to register deaths on an electronic system, allowing relatives to report deaths while socially distancing.\nIn Uganda, the Civil Registration Office has set up the Mobile Vital Records System for the registration of births and deaths in health centres and at a community level. \nOver the next decade, data scientists hope this kind of innovation will help more countries on the continent to reach their universal death registration targets.\nThe BBC's research has highlighted some of the problems and the UNECA's Mr Muhwava said that it had brought \"to the fore the challenges that CRVS systems in Africa face in documenting death events\".\nCREDITS \nData journalist: Krystina Shveda\nJournalist: Kevyah Cardoso\nSenior investigations producer: Louise Adamou\nExecutive producers: Jacky Martens and Nick Ericsson\nResearchers: Maxime Koami Domegni (Senegal) Saikou Jabai Suware (The Gambia), Boubacar Diallo (Guinea), Yasine Mohabeuth (Comoros), Carlos Tobias (Togo), Vincent Niebede (Chad), Alberto Dabo (Guinea-Bissau), Serge Tomondji (Burkina Faso), Crispin Dembasse (Central African Republic), Curtis Slimar (Zambia), Gregory Gondwe (Malawi), Awedni Daweja (Tunisia), Abdelrahman Abutaleb (Egypt)"

      "text": "All adults in Wales will have been offered a first Covid vaccine by 31 July, the health minister has promised.\nVaughan Gething said matching Prime Minister Boris Johnson's jab pledge for the whole UK would depend on supplies.\nThe new date is a few months ahead of the original autumn plan laid out by the Welsh Government in January.\nOver-50s and over-16s with an underlying health condition will be offered vaccines by the middle of April, Mr Gething added.\nWales is currently ahead of the other UK nations in the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated.\nAt a press conference where he made the vaccine announcement, Mr Gething said that trying to make long-term forecasts on Covid \"has made a mug of a range of people\".\nThe UK prime minister had suggested restrictions could be lifted in England by 21 June in his lifting lockdown roadmap.\nIn comments criticising the England plans, Mr Gething said predicting what the situation will be like after Easter was more like \"astrology rather than scientific and public health advice\". \n\"When it comes to a longer term forecasting beyond the middle of April it starts to feel that it's not a sensible approach,\" he said.\nRapid testing was also announced for private and public organisations with more than 50 employees. \nMr Gething said workplaces that are at higher risk will be prioritised.\nTargeted community testing will also begin in parts of Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf, in a bid to find people with coronavirus who do not have symptoms.\nLateral flow tests - plastic devices that aim to give results within half an hour - will be used.\nThere have been more than 4.1 million confirmed cases and 121,000 deaths of people with coronavirus in the UK, while in Wales nearly 7,300 people have died and more than 200,000 have tested positive for Covid.\nAbout 18 million people in the UK have had their first Covid jab with 878,000 of those in Wales. In Wales, nearly 50,000 have now been given a second dose of the vaccine.\nWales has the lowest Covid case rate of any of the UK nations for the last three weeks - with an infection rate of less than 76 cases per 100,000 people.\nMr Gething said coronavirus cases in Wales are now at their lowest level since September and the country's R number is between 0.6 and 0.9.\nHis announcement comes as the joint committee on vaccination (JCVI) agreed that people on the learning disability register should now be prioritised.\nUnder Welsh Government guidance people with learning disabilities, and individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar or mental illnesses which cause functional impairment will be called for vaccination in priority group six.\nOfficials say they are taking an \"inclusion\" approach in identifying those who should be called forward, and they expect this to result in more individuals being prioritised than might otherwise be the case if the JCVI guidance was strictly interpreted.\nThe guidance recommends using GP surgeries rather than mass vaccination centres to administer the vaccines.\n\"Today really is good news and I hope we will give people lots of comfort that they can expect to be receiving those appointments in the very near future,\" the minister said.\nMr Gething is responsible for the vaccination roll out in Wales while the UK government purchases the jabs.\nConservative Janet Finch-Saunders said the July target was a \"huge game changer\".\nBut she said expectations will grow as more people were vaccinated and it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Gething had been \"vague\" about visits to care homes.\nPlaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell welcomed the announcement that guidance would be issued on prioritising vaccinations for people with learning disabilities or severe mental illness, and also for unpaid carers.\nHowever she questioned why the announcement could not have been given to families \"two weeks ago\"."

In legal terms, it determines whether probable cause exists to believe a crime has been committed.\nMs James expressed disappointment with the grand jury's verdict, alluding to other cases in which officers had not been held accountable for \"the unjustified killing of unarmed African Americans\".\nMr Prude's death was one of the key events in months of unrest over racial injustice in the US last year.\nHis arrest bore similarities to that of George Floyd, who died in police custody a few months later in Minnesota.\nMr Prude, 41, had been suffering from acute mental health problems when his brother called police.\nWhen they arrived, officers found Mr Prude running naked in the street near his brother's home in Rochester.\nWhile hooded and being held down, he stopped breathing and died a week later after being taken off life support.\nBut details of his death did not come to national attention until September 2020, when body camera footage of the arrest was released by the family after a public records request.\nThe case led to the suspension of seven officers and the dismissal of the city's police chief.\nMr Prude's family have filed a lawsuit, accusing the police department of trying to cover up the facts around his death."

      "text": "Hellen Ward, co-founder of beauty salon chain Richard Ward, says her debts have been racking up while her salons have been closed due to Covid restrictions.  \n\"We have worked out it's probably \u00a31,000 a day in debt that we have incurred in being closed,\" she said.\nShe is part of a campaign calling on the government to cut VAT to help mend the hair and beauty sector's finances.\nA survey of salon owners suggests that 56% are considering closing.\nThe Save our Salons campaign group also estimates that nearly four in five will recruit no apprentices this year\nAny closures would harm the finances of women the most - almost 90% of salon workers are women.\nThe group says there are 45,000 salons providing jobs for nearly 300,000 people.\nHairdressers and nail salons are set to re-open from 12 April along with many other retailers.\nBut a long period of closure means they, like many businesses, have been racking up debts. Campaigners say their businesses operate on low profit margins of between 2-5%.\n\"We urgently need our VAT cut to 5%, the same chop in VAT enjoyed by restaurants and bars since July last year,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\nWithout help to rebuild their finances, businesses may find it preferable to close their doors, she said.\n\"We employ such a lot of trainees - where will we be in five years' time if we lose those skill sets?\" she said.\nLike many businesses, hers and others in the beauty trade have received government help, notably in the form of the furlough scheme, which has paid many staff wages while people have been out of work.\n\"Furlough has been fantastic but it's not free,\" Ms Ward said. Employers must still make national insurance contributions. \nMany beauty companies have been paying full rent during the lockdown, despite making little or no income. Most sales come from treatments rather than products, she said.\nLarger salons with lots of employees, big rents and high rates have particularly struggled, says Gina Conway, who owns three hair and beauty salons in London. She opened her first 20 years ago.\nHer salons have been closed for 238 days in the year since the first lockdown.\n\"Because hairdressers can't do takeaway or home visits or online haircuts we are all really struggling to cover our costs,\" she told the BBC.\nShe still has to pay rent, insurance and utility bills. Support from her landlord has been mixed. One has offered a discount during the lockdown, one has not replied to her requests and one won't budge.\n\"I have a successful business and I plan on growing, I'm just holding my breath on what the government can do to help,\" she says."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his first bilateral meeting with a foreign leader since taking office.\nThe two leaders highlighted mutual policy priorities around climate change and China.\nThey vowed to align climate goals to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\nAnd Mr Biden said the US would help Canada secure the release of two Canadians held by Beijing, saying they were not bartering chips.\nCanada is often the destination chosen for a US president's first foreign trip, but Covid-19 scuppered Mr Biden's plans. Instead, the meeting was held remotely.\nMr Biden, a Democrat, is hoping to hit the reset button with Mr Trudeau, a Liberal, whose relationship with the former Republican US President Trump was often considered rocky. \nMr Trudeau also pledged to work with the US to \"get through Covid but also to make sure we're pulling our weight around the world\".\nThe leaders did not take questions from journalists, which is unusual in Washington for a bilateral event such as this.\nMr Trudeau in his opening remarks criticised the Trump administration, and thanked Mr Biden for \"stepping up\". \nThe prime minister added: \"As we are preparing the joint rollout and communique... it's nice when the Americans aren't pulling out all references to climate change.\"\nBut the two leaders did not publicly comment on the White House's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would have boosted oil supplies from Canada's Alberta province to US refineries.\nIn a phone call two days after Mr Biden took office - Mr Biden's first official call as president - Mr Trudeau conveyed his \"disappointment\" at the pipeline decision. A US official later said the closure would \"not be reconsidered\".\nDevelopment of the pipeline was originally blocked by the Obama administration in 2015, but former President Donald Trump overturned that order and allowed it go ahead.\nThe project has been bitterly opposed by environmentalists and Native American groups for more than a decade. They see it as highly polluting and potentially a major setback to efforts to move away from fossil fuels.\nIndustry groups say it would create thousands of jobs and increase US energy security.\nEarlier on Tuesday, US Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Mr Biden had made clear to Mr Trudeau that the project was \"not in the interests of the United States and that we want to try to address our climate crisis, while also creating good paying union jobs\".\nThe US and Canada share one of the world's largest trade partnerships, and exchange close to $2bn (C$2.5bn/\u00a31.4bn) in goods and services daily.\nIt lacked much of the pageantry of an official bilateral meeting of leaders at the White House, but both Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau expressed optimism that US-Canadian relations were poised to take a turn for the better after Donald Trump's tumultuous four years in the White House.\n\"US leadership has been sorely missed over the past years,\" Trudeau told his American counterpart at the beginning of what was, essentially, a glorified video conference. He was speaking of the US's changed attitude toward climate change, but that kind of sentiment permeated the public portions of the day's events.\nTrudeau had very publicly clashed with Trump, in a war of words conducted via duelling press releases and tweets. Now, Trudeau said, he was looking forward to working closely with the US again.\nBy the time the day was over, in their closing statements, Trudeau was referring to Biden as \"Joe,\" and Biden was pledging to Trudeau - who towered on a massive screen beside him - that the US \"has no closer and no more important friend than Canada\".\nThe two nations still have notable differences - on trade and oil pipeline construction in particular - but at least for a day, it was all smiles and promises of better days to come.\nOne major issue for both leaders is the Chinese detention of two Canadians, who have been accused of spying and held in jail since 2018.\nCanada alleges that the men were arrested as retribution for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant.\nMichael Spavor and Michael Kovrig were arrested in China in 2018 and formally indicted in June 2020.\nCalling for their release in remarks following the meeting, Mr Biden said: \"Human beings are not bartering chips. We're going to work together until we get their safe return.\""

The UK, EU and Canada have also ordered doses and 500 million doses have also been ordered through the Covax scheme to supply poorer nations.\nThe briefing document published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives more detail on the data submitted by Janssen, a pharmaceutical branch of Johnson & Johnson, to the regulator. The FDA concludes that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has \"known benefits\" in reducing both symptomatic and severe illness.\nIt comes after the firm released data last month.\nResults from trials conducted in the US, South Africa and Brazil found its efficacy against the worst outcomes of the virus was \"similarly high\" but overall protection was lower in South Africa and Brazil, where virus variants have become dominant.\nData showed it was more than 85% effective at preventing serious illness, but only 66% effective overall when moderate cases were included, when considering cases at least 28 days after vaccination.\nNotably, there were no deaths among participants who had received the vaccine and no hospital admissions after 28 days post-vaccine.\nAn external committee of experts will meet on Friday to recommend whether the FDA should authorise the vaccine, possibly adding to a coming surge in vaccine availability in the US. The US would be the first country in the world to approve the vaccine.\nA White House official said the administration anticipated distributing at least three million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine next week, should it receive emergency authorisation from the FDA.\nThe company says it plans to deliver 20 million doses in total by late March, in line with an agreement to supply the US with 100m doses by the end of June.\nNot only will the vaccine require fewer doses than its two-shot Pfizer and Moderna counterparts, it will also require fewer vaccine appointments and medical staff as a result.\nOver 65 million Americans have already been vaccinated and about 1.3 million doses are being administered across the country each day.  \nHalf a million people in the US have died of Covid but new cases, hospitalisations and deaths have all been on the decline over the past few weeks.\nTop public health experts, however, continue to warn that mutations of the virus can still threaten progress."

      "text": "About 31,000 women in London are being offered \"do-it-at-home\" tests to check for early warnings of cervical cancer, as part of an NHS trial. \nIt could be a way to encourage more women to get screened, experts hope.\nEmbarrassment, cultural barriers and worries about Covid, along with many other factors, can stop women going for smear tests at a clinic or GP surgery. \nSmear-test delays during the pandemic prompted calls for home-screening kits from cervical cancer charities.\nThe swabbing involves using a long, thin cotton bud to take a sample from inside the vagina, which is then sent by post for testing.\nSelf-sampling is already offered in countries such as Denmark and Australia.\nWomen aged 25-64, overdue for a check and living in Barnet, Camden, Islington, Newham or Tower Hamlets will be offered a kit from their GP or in the post.\nIf the results reveal an infection called human papillomavirus (HPV) they will be invited to their GP for a standard smear test to closely examine the cells of their cervix. \nHPV infections can cause these to change, sometimes developing into cancer. \nFinding and treating cancer early can save lives. \nCancer Research UK said the trial would help further understanding about how effective self-sampling could be in cervical screening and who it should be offered to.\nIn-person screenings in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have restarted after being halted during the first coronavirus lockdown.\nIn England, the NHS told GPs and clinics not to halt smear tests - but some patients have experienced cancellations and long waiting times.\nAbout 600,000 tests failed to go ahead in the UK last April and May, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said, in addition to a backlog of 1.5 million appointments missed annually.\nDr Anita Lim, from King's College London, who is leading the YouScreen trial, said: \"Women who don't come for regular screening are at the highest risk of developing cervical cancer.\n\"So it is crucial that we find ways like this to make screening easier and protect women from what is a largely preventable cancer.\n\"Self-sampling is a game-changer. \n\"This simple and convenient swab means it can be done in the privacy and comfort of your own home.\"\nNational clinical director for cancer for the NHS in England Prof Peter Johnson said: \"GPs have taken extra precautions to make surgeries safe.\n\"And these home kits give thousands of women another option to keep up to date with their screening.\""

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,Douglas Ross",
      "text": "Holyrood faces a \"crisis of credibility\" over its inquiry into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, opposition leaders have claimed.\nThe row centres on written evidence submitted to the inquiry by Mr Salmond that was later redacted at the request of the Crown Office.\nThe Crown Office has dismissed concerns the move was politically motivated.\nMr Salmond is now expected to give evidence to the inquiry on Friday.\nIn another development,  MSPs on the inquiry committee have used their statutory powers to demand the release of more Crown Office documents.   \nThey are asking the Crown Office to hand over all correspondence between Peter Murrell, chief executive officer of the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon's husband, Liz Lloyd, Nicola Sturgeon's chief of staff, Sue Ruddick, chief operating officer for the SNP and Ian McCann, SNP compliance officer. \nMr Salmond claims the documents being requested will show he was the victim of a high-level plot.\nMs Sturgeon, who has emphatically denied there was any such plotting against her former boss, is scheduled to appear before MSPs next week.\nShe described suggestions that the Crown Office's intervention was politically influenced as \"downright wrong\".\nAlex Salmond had been due to appear before the committee on Tuesday but pulled out when the parliament withdrew and then republished a redacted version of one of his submissions - after \"grave concerns\" were raised by the Crown Office. \nAnswering an urgent question in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC said the decision to ask for the document to be amended was taken independently by \"senior professional prosecutors\".\nAnd he said that government ministers had not sought to direct them.\nHe added: \"The Crown has no interest in interfering with or limiting the conduct of proceedings in this parliament.\n\"Its only interest is securing compliance with an order of the High Court with which we are all obliged to comply.\"\nThe law officer was responding to a question by Scottish Labour interim leader Jackie Baillie, who said it was \"simply unacceptable that the Lord Advocate refused to answer the questions put to him with any detail\".\nShe added: \"The fact of the matter is that the parliament is not getting straight answers from a Lord Advocate who appears to have viewed this afternoon's session in the chamber as a necessary chore and not a chance to engage with the Scottish Parliament in a spirit of democratic accountability.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Salmond said in a statement that his lawyers would be writing to the Lord Advocate to ask for an explanation for the Crown Office's \"unprecedented and highly irregular actions\". \nMr Salmond said he had also instructed his lawyers to request specifically that the Crown \"preserve and retain all material and communications with all or any third parties which led to their decision to intervene at the very last minute\" before he was due to appear before the inquiry. \nHis submission to the inquiry accuses First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of misleading parliament, and was posted on the parliament's website on Monday.\nIt was published after MSPs on Holyrood's corporate body decided after taking legal advice that it was possible to do so.\nBut the corporate body agreed on Tuesday morning to remove and revise the document after receiving a letter from the Crown Office which expressed \"grave concerns\". \nThe Crown Office later said it had taken action because of issues of potential contempt of court. \nThe inquiry has been hit by severe delays since it started its work, with opposition MSPs accusing both the Scottish government and Mr Salmond of attempting to frustrate it and avoid scrutiny. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme earlier on Wednesday, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"of course\" parliament was facing a crisis of credibility over the inquiry.\nHe said: \"This sleaze and scandal within the SNP has now undermined everything that's going on in Holyrood and the nationalists are clearly treating parliament and the Scottish people with contempt\".\nThe Lord Advocate was appointed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and is both the head of the Crown Office and the Scottish government's chief legal adviser. \nSeparate documents submitted to the inquiry by Mr Salmond accuse the Crown Office of being unfit for purpose under its current leadership, and claim it is too close to both the Scottish government and the SNP.\nMr Salmond also alleged that there was \"a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned.\"\nMr Ross claimed that the Lord Advocate being a member of the Scottish government meant there could be a possible conflict of interest in his involvement. \nRuth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative group leader at Holyrood, later told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that she believed there should be an independent, judge-led inquiry into \"why the government is not allowing a committee of its own parliament to have access to information they need\".\nShe added: \"At the moment the government is running riot and is denying the parliament its right of scrutiny.\"\nMs Sturgeon, who is currently due to give evidence to the inquiry next week, has denied there was a conspiracy against Mr Salmond, saying her predecessor had made claims \"without a shred of evidence\".\nShe has also denied that she breached the ministerial code or that her government has attempted to obstruct the inquiry, and has said that she is \"relishing\" the prospect of giving evidence in person. \nSpeaking at her daily coronavirus briefing, she said: \"Decisions the Crown Office takes in relation to enforcing or upholding the law are taken independently of government.\n\"Any suggestion at all that these decisions are in any way politically influenced is downright wrong\".\nMs Sturgeon also said she did not believe the redaction of the document was a good reason for Mr Salmond to refuse to appear before the inquiry.\nThe inquiry committee has been examining what went wrong with the government's internal investigation into sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond that were made by two female civil servants.\nThe government had to pay legal expenses of more than \u00a3500,000 to Mr Salmond after it admitted it had acted unlawfully during the investigation. \nMr Salmond was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against a total of nine women after a High Court trial last year."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Ghana,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Ghana has become the first country to receive coronavirus vaccines through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative.\nA delivery of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Accra on Wednesday. The first recipients are due to be healthcare workers.\nThe Covax scheme aims to reduce the divide between rich countries and poorer nations unable to buy doses.\nThe programme is planning to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year.\nGhana, which has a population of over 30m, was chosen as the first recipient of the free vaccines after promising quick distribution and meeting the criteria set by Covax.\nFurther deliveries are expected to neighbouring Ivory Coast later this week, the Covax alliance says.\nVaccinations are expected to start in Ghana next week, and, as well as health workers, those over 60, people with underlying health conditions, and senior officials are due to be prioritised.\nThe vaccines delivered to Accra were produced by the Serum Institute of India and developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its roll-out in Ghana is not part of a trial.\nThe doses being sent to lower-income countries such as Ghana are funded by donations. As well as procuring and delivering the vaccines, Covax partners are supporting local authorities in areas such as training people to administer the jabs and helping provide an adequate cold-chain storage and delivery system.\nMany nations in the developed world, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need.\nBut many of those countries placed orders for doses with pharmaceutical companies before knowing whether the vaccine in development would be effective. They were hedging their bets - placing multiple orders in the hope that at least some of them would work out.\nThe UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said it will donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries.\nThe Covax scheme is led by the WHO and also involves the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi). \nIn a joint statement, the WHO and the United Nations children's fund (Unicef) said it was a momentous occasion and \"critical in bringing the pandemic to an end\".\nGhana has recorded more than 80,700 cases of coronavirus and 580 deaths since the pandemic began. These numbers are believed to fall short of the actual toll because of low levels of testing.\nThough the vaccines are not generally intended for children, Unicef is involved in the scheme because of its expertise in procurement and the logistics of vaccine delivery.\nThe Covax scheme was set up by the WHO, the Gavi vaccines alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to try to prevent poorer countries from being pushed to the back of the queue.\nThe programme is designed so that richer countries buying vaccines agree to help finance access for poorer nations, too. \nIt hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. In particular, it wants to ensure 92 poorer countries will receive access to vaccines at the same time as 98 wealthier countries.\nIt aims to reach up to 20% of the populations of poorer countries, at no cost to their governments.\nMost African countries are intended recipients of Covax, but a number of them such as Senegal have been making provisions for vaccines outside the initiative.\nCommenting on Wednesday's first shipment, the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it was a major first step but just the beginning.\n\"We will not end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere\", he added.\nAnalysis by BBC Africa health editor Anne Mawathe\nThe arrival of the first Covax vaccines in Ghana follows sharp criticism that African countries could be left behind in the fight against Covid-19. Western countries have been condemned for their rush to purchase more vaccines than they needed, leaving little left over for the rest of the world.\nBut this is just a start.\nGhana, a country with a population of about 31 million people, has now got a total of 600,000 doses of the vaccine. \nAfrica, a continent with about 1.4 billion people, is largely still waiting on Covax to deliver.\nIt is unlikely that many governments on the continent will go to the market and fight it out with countries with more financial muscle. In fact, most African countries will be buying the vaccines at a higher price than their Western counterparts, partly because they didn't pre-order.\nSome have called for the big pharmaceutical companies to stop blocking a patent waiver, which would lead to lower prices and mean more vaccine would be produced. \nBut the companies have not agreed to this, knowing it could dent any profit margin.\nCovax has so far raised $6bn (\u00a34.3bn), but says it needs at least another $2bn to meet its target for 2021.\nThe scheme has faced some criticism for not moving quickly enough. One WHO board member, Austria's Dr Clemens Martin Auer, said it had been slow to secure vaccine deals and deliver doses.\nThe joint statement on Wednesday said the shipment to Ghana represented \"the beginning of what should be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history\".\nNana Kofi Quakyi, who is a health policy research fellow at New York University's School of Global Public Health, told the BBC that Ghana would still struggle to compete with wealthier nations to make up the shortfall in doses it needed to find, even with the Covax initiative.\n\"The challenge that countries like Ghana are having is that in an open market, our bargaining power for bilateral deals is just not competitive against other wealthier countries that... in some cases, are buying more than they even need.\""

She is due to stand trial in July.\nIn a court filing, her lawyers said she had no desire to leave the US.\nShe would be willing to renounce her foreign citizenship \"to eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries\", the filing added.\nHer lawyers also proposed that her and her husband's assets be placed in a monitored account, to prevent her being able to use the money to leave the country.\nMs Maxwell has been in jail in Brooklyn, New York, since she was arrested last July at her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire.\nThis is her third application for bail, after two previous attempts were unsuccessful.\nIn her last bid for bail in December, her lawyers proposed that she be allowed to return home with armed guards to prevent her from escaping.\nProsecutors then said there was a risk that, if bailed, Ms Maxwell could use her wealth to flee to France or the UK where she is a citizen and suggested she might try to avoid extradition.\nMs Maxwell, the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, was in a relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein in the 1990s. She allegedly introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures including Bill Clinton and the Duke of York, Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family.\nEpstein took his own life in prison in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\nFour of the charges against Ms Maxwell relate to the years between 1994 and 1997, when prosecutors say she helped Epstein groom girls as young as 14. The other two charges are allegations of perjury in 2016.\nShe faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted in her trial in July."

      "tags": "Family,IVF,Surrogacy,Parenting",
      "text": "Stephen Dyer always wanted to be a father.\nIn a relationship for five years, he discussed starting a family with his partner. \nThen, last May, his partner had a change of heart and they separated. For Stephen it was a turning point.\nHe decided to start looking at how to become a father with a surrogate. He is one of a small, but believed to be growing, number of men who have decided to have children through IVF. \n\"I thought - I'm 34, I have time but do I want to put myself through another three or four-year relationship only to reach the same point?\" said Stephen.\nThere are an increasing number of single women becoming mothers through IVF, however there are no statistics about the number of single men doing so.\nSurrogacy UK, who help introduce so-called 'intended parents' with surrogates, said they have seen an increase in the number of single people, including men, wanting to become members.\n\"I'm an only child. I didn't come out as gay until I was 26 partly because I didn't want to let down my parents, as I didn't want them to think they weren't going to have grandchildren,\" Stephen said.\nThe secondary school teacher looked at surrogacy in 2014 but then met his ex-partner.\n\"After our relationship broke down I felt like, I was happy to do it single before, and I am now,\" he said.\n\"There are a range of ways you can do it, not just surrogacy. There's co-parenting or adoption, but I have a deep burning desire for a biological child. \n\"Myself and my ex-partner were registered foster parents for a time and I looked at adoption, but in the end I wanted to experience biological fatherhood.\"\nIt was the start of a journey he's only part-way through. \nHaving settled on host surrogacy, where an embryo is created with a donor egg and carried by a surrogate, he expects the costs to be up to \u00a340,000.\nIt means he has had to re-mortgage his home in Newport.\n\"I'll do anything that I possibly can to realise my dream of becoming a father,\" he said. \nUntil January 2019, a single man could not have a child through surrogacy and be legally recognised as the only parent. \nA surrogate who carries a child is always named as a parent on a birth certificate. \nThe intended parents must apply for a parental order to change that, which can take months.\nNow a single man or woman can apply for a parental order to remove the surrogate with a single parent named instead.\nThe number of children born this way is about 10 times greater than a decade ago. It has become so common that the Law Commission is reviewing surrogacy laws. \nStephen, who blogs about his experience, knows a number of single men considering fatherhood through surrogacy.\nHe said: \"There's a Facebook group for single men, not just gay but straight men too, and people are coming forward and saying, 'You know, I want this as well, this is my dream'.\n\"We have become a community of single men who want to become dads.\"\nIn November his clinic found him an egg donor.\nHe said: \"They emailed to say I would be the sole recipient of the eggs. She's in her thirties, has blue eyes, dark blonde hair, olive skin, is 1.68m tall, weighs 88kg, doesn't have children and likes theatre, nature, animals and books.\"\nTwo months later she donated her eggs and Stephen was called by the clinic the next day. Five eggs were fertilised. \n\"A week later two embryos had been created, which remain on ice in the clinic,\" he said.\n\"I really hope that by this time next year, one of these will be growing into a little person.\"\nDavid Watkins, from Southampton, was one of the first single fathers to be granted a parental order as a single father in the UK after his son Miles was born last year.\nHe has started up a website to help other men thinking of going it alone.\n\"A lot of single men have just accepted the fact that they're never going to have biological children they don't even know that the law has changed,\" he said.\n\"But now people are learning about the new changes in the law, I have noticed an increase in traffic and inquiries from single men who are looking to be dads on the website, in the last year.\"\nFor Stephen the next step is finding a surrogate. \nThis can take months and cost thousands of pounds in expenses.\n\"Hopefully I'll be able to find, or somebody will come forward and help me realise my dreams of becoming a dad,\" he said.\n\"And who knows, maybe in 12 or 18 months time I might I might have my own little mini-me running around?\"\nHe hopes the surrogate will become a \"friend and family\".\n\"I always anticipated I would have a partner or there will be somebody with me to bring the child up together,\" he said.\n\"But you can do it on your own, it is possible.\n\"It is not quite as easy as having a child could be, but I'm excited to be a father. I can't wait.\"\nWatch Wales Live on BBC One Wales at 22:35 GMT on Wednesday and on the BBC iPlayer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are \"deep and complex issues\" with using vaccine passports or certificates to prove someone's Covid \"status\", Boris Johnson has said.\nAnnouncing a review of the proposal, he said using certificates to allow visits to venues such as pubs and theatres was a \"novelty for our country\".\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will lead the review.\nMr Johnson said he was \"very optimistic\" most Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June.\nVaccine passports have been discussed by countries, including Greece, and operators such as Saga Cruises, as a way to safely reopen international leisure travel.\nBut ministers have frequently appeared to dismiss introducing a similar scheme domestically within the UK for hospitality or leisure activities.\nIt comes as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said - if all goes to plan - she expects to see a phased but significant reopening of the Scottish economy in the last week of April.\nA further 8,489 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Tuesday and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 121,305.\nMore than 17.9 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures.\nSpeaking during a visit to a south London school, Mr Johnson said the UK had \"never thought in terms of having something that you have to show to go to a pub or a theatre\".\nHe said there were \"ethical issues\" about the role of government \"in mandating\u2026 or banning people from doing such a thing\".\nHe added: \"We can't be discriminatory against people who can't have the vaccine, there might be a medical reason, or some people may genuinely refuse to have one - I think that's a mistake.\"\nBut the prime minister said it was possible to consider the issue at the same time as the rollout of the vaccine.\nIt is understood the review will not just consider vaccination history alone, with the possibility of negative Covid tests being recorded to gain access to some events or services, if required by the organisers. \nOne option could see the NHS app used to record both, with an individual then able to show their status on the app if required.\nThe government previously said it would consider how to facilitate Covid certificates for people who needed to travel to other countries which demanded them.\nThe review's findings are hoped to be available before the final stage of England's lockdown easing on 21 June, the earliest date by which ministers hope most Covid measures can end.\nBBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said the review marked a change of position from ministers but that, with businesses already looking at ways they could keep workers and customers safe, the government was looking to get ahead of things.\n\"The conversation was just happening anyway. Businesses were looking at ways to make their workplaces safe, organisations were looking at ways to try to make their customers safe and the government risked not being part of that conversation but eventually being brought into it anyway,\" she said.\nA No 10 spokesman said an international consensus needed to be built on how to allow greater foreign travel, which the UK was seeking to achieve via the G7 and other multilateral discussions. \n\"It will be for different countries to determine their own regimes in relation to the quarantine and who they want to allow in, and we want to try and work together to get some sort of international framework,\" he said.\nGreek tourism minister Haris Theoharis told the BBC last week that early technical discussions were under way with UK officials about how a potential passport scheme might work.\nSaga Cruises announced last month it would require all travellers to prove they had received two vaccine doses before departure.\n\"You will be required to bring the vaccination document and/or evidence with you as proof at the time of boarding,\" its website said.\nHolidays in the UK or abroad are not currently permitted under coronavirus restrictions. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said a review of how to return to international travel while managing risk from imported cases and virus variants would report on 12 April.\nMeanwhile, holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since plans for easing lockdown in England were unveiled on Monday.\nLabour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC a review of vaccine passports was \"sensible\" but said it should be \"conclusive\" and consider all the evidence available.\nChristopher Dye, professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, told the BBC that vaccine passports would \"certainly be helpful in releasing the lockdown\" but they should not \"make things worse for people of lesser means\".\nMr Johnson said his roadmap for easing lockdown measures, laid out on Monday, was \"a cautious but irreversible approach\".\nDue to the vaccine programme, the country could \"look at that 21 June date with some optimism\".\nMr Johnson said each phase of unlocking restrictions -  such as children going back to school -  would be \"adding to the budget of risk\". \nThis is why time was needed between measures to \"observe\" the impact, he added.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted measures to become a \"matter of personal responsibility and social norms\" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nOutlining her own roadmap, Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to end stay at home restrictions from 5 April in Scotland.\nMeanwhile in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the country's \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England."

      "tags": "Criminal justice system",
      "text": "The victims' commissioner for England and Wales has called for a law to ensure people affected by crime are treated properly as they wait for justice. \nDame Vera Baird QC said victims had for too long been treated like bystanders. \nShe said mounting evidence of a loss of confidence in criminal justice was driven by people's experiences. \nThe government is introducing a new victims' code and has promised to consult on creating legal rights. \nIn a wide-ranging report, Dame Vera said falling confidence in criminal justice could only be restored by treating victims as participants rather than outsiders in events that could have been pivotal moments in their lives. \nShe calls for the police, courts and prosecutors to be made legally accountable for basic standards of care: \n\"There is a collapse in confidence and it is not just about Covid [backlogs in courts], and it's not just about delay,\" Dame Vera told the BBC. \"It is very largely to do with how people are treated.\"\nShe said that a victims' law would be a once in a generation landmark piece of legislation that would transform experiences.\n\"We are trying to put the victim at the centre of the criminal justice system. The defendant stays securely where they are, well protected. But at the moment, because all the focus is on prosecuting, investigating and making sure that the defendant has a fair trial, nobody's duty is to look after a victim.\"\nDame Vera recommends that compensation due to a victim should be paid to them directly by the court. Under the current system, offenders often pay tiny instalments to the court because of their limited means, meaning it takes years for the money to come through. \nShe also calls for people who have experienced anti-social behaviour to be recognised as victims of crime and given appropriate support. \nWhile a specific victims' law would be entirely new in England and Wales, it has been successfully implemented in parts of Australia, which has the same style of criminal justice system. \nConservative governments have promised for six years to place a legal duty on the criminal justice system to properly look after victims. Ministers say they will consult on that proposal later this year - 30 years after the first code of conduct towards victims was published. \nThe latest version of that code will be introduced in April - but critics say that without legal teeth many victims will not benefit from its promises to ensure they are listened to and kept informed. Labour has separately launched its own attempt to create a victims' law, although it stands virtually no chance of becoming law. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Our new code enhances the rights of victims at every stage of the justice process. But we plan to go further, strengthening and enshrining these rights in a new victims' law.\n\"We are also investing millions in vital support services, recruiting more independent sexual and domestic abuse advisers, and reviewing the entire response to rape to build back confidence in the justice system.\""

Thankfully the representation of women on boards and in leadership positions has significantly improved in recent years, with this review having played a critical role in realising that. \n\"Our collective efforts to truly eradicate those barriers and create an inclusive leadership culture doesn't stop here, this is where it intensifies.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion.\n\"To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,\" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit.\nThe donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid.\nIt came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access.\nCovax was created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations.\nThe scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups.\nIts initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. \nCovax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. \nGhana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. \nSince then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. \nMost doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada, which defended its request.\nCovax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal.  \nCountries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies.\nThe UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses.\nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for \"gobbling up\" the global vaccine supply. \nG7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population.\nSix vaccines have been given \"emergency use authorisation\" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac.\nHowever, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. \nModerna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its \"lowest-tiered price\", but most won't be available until 2022. \nCovax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. \nDeliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials there restricted exports to protect their own population amid soaring infection rates. These are set to resume from October. \nCovax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. \nRepresentatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. \nUnicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to \"accelerate their donation plans\", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. \nWhile many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nCovax says it is now expecting to hit its \"key milestone\" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. \nIn total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide.\nHowever, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive.\nCovax aims to close that gap. \"With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,\" the WHO says on its website. \nBut even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic.\nThe WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected. "

She's trying to go to sleep but she can't because she's so worried,\" he told the BBC. \n\"Everyone wanted this exclusive but only one team got it and it made headlines everywhere for days,\" the judges said. \nFollowing Rashford's intervention, the government ended up extending the provision of free school meals into the summer holidays.\nThe BBC's Clive Myrie won network presenter of the year for what judges called his \"versatile, measured and compelling style\". \nHe had documented life on the front-line of the pandemic with reports from the Royal London Hospital, where he found staff struggling to cope.\n\"The jury agreed the winner had had an astonishing year - as excellent as a package maker and interviewer as a studio and location presenter,\" the judges said. \nThe Andrew Marr Show was recognised for its interview with the Chinese Ambassador, Liu Xiaoming.\nHe was shown drone footage which appeared to show its Uighur population being blindfolded and led to trains, and which has been authenticated by Australian security services.\nThe judges described the interview as \"a master class in technique, gutsy and went for the jugular\".\nSky News won five awards, including news channel of the year, while daily news programme of the year went to ITV's News at Ten. \nThe judges' award was given to all the technical teams in recognition of the \"ingenuity, innovation and speed they demonstrated this year to keep journalism on the air\". \nChair of the awards Simon Bucks said: \"This has been an incredibly challenging year for all journalists and news organisations. \n\"Despite the difficulties of covering the Covid-19 pandemic, all the broadcasters who enter these awards have distinguished themselves with some remarkable coverage and every one of the nominees would have been a worthy winner.  \n\"Moreover, many of them were not about the Coronavirus, but a range of other important stories which in any normal year would have dominated the agenda.\"\nThe other winners were:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are \"deep and complex issues\" with using vaccine passports or certificates to prove someone's Covid \"status\", Boris Johnson has said.\nAnnouncing a review of the proposal, he said using certificates to allow visits to venues such as pubs and theatres was a \"novelty for our country\".\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will lead the review.\nMr Johnson said he was \"very optimistic\" most Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June.\nVaccine passports have been discussed by countries, including Greece, and operators such as Saga Cruises, as a way to safely reopen international leisure travel.\nBut ministers have frequently appeared to dismiss introducing a similar scheme domestically within the UK for hospitality or leisure activities.\nIt comes as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said - if all goes to plan - she expects to see a phased but significant reopening of the Scottish economy in the last week of April.\nA further 8,489 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Tuesday and 548 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 121,305.\nMore than 17.9 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures.\nSpeaking during a visit to a south London school, Mr Johnson said the UK had \"never thought in terms of having something that you have to show to go to a pub or a theatre\".\nHe said there were \"ethical issues\" about the role of government \"in mandating\u2026 or banning people from doing such a thing\".\nHe added: \"We can't be discriminatory against people who can't have the vaccine, there might be a medical reason, or some people may genuinely refuse to have one - I think that's a mistake.\"\nBut the prime minister said it was possible to consider the issue at the same time as the rollout of the vaccine.\nIt is understood the review will not just consider vaccination history alone, with the possibility of negative Covid tests being recorded to gain access to some events or services, if required by the organisers. \nOne option could see the NHS app used to record both, with an individual then able to show their status on the app if required.\nThe government previously said it would consider how to facilitate Covid certificates for people who needed to travel to other countries which demanded them.\nThe review's findings are hoped to be available before the final stage of England's lockdown easing on 21 June, the earliest date by which ministers hope most Covid measures can end.\nBBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said the review marked a change of position from ministers but that, with businesses already looking at ways they could keep workers and customers safe, the government was looking to get ahead of things.\n\"The conversation was just happening anyway. Businesses were looking at ways to make their workplaces safe, organisations were looking at ways to try to make their customers safe and the government risked not being part of that conversation but eventually being brought into it anyway,\" she said.\nA No 10 spokesman said an international consensus needed to be built on how to allow greater foreign travel, which the UK was seeking to achieve via the G7 and other multilateral discussions. \n\"It will be for different countries to determine their own regimes in relation to the quarantine and who they want to allow in, and we want to try and work together to get some sort of international framework,\" he said.\nGreek tourism minister Haris Theoharis told the BBC last week that early technical discussions were under way with UK officials about how a potential passport scheme might work.\nSaga Cruises announced last month it would require all travellers to prove they had received two vaccine doses before departure.\n\"You will be required to bring the vaccination document and/or evidence with you as proof at the time of boarding,\" its website said.\nHolidays in the UK or abroad are not currently permitted under coronavirus restrictions. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said a review of how to return to international travel while managing risk from imported cases and virus variants would report on 12 April.\nMeanwhile, holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since plans for easing lockdown in England were unveiled on Monday.\nLabour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC a review of vaccine passports was \"sensible\" but said it should be \"conclusive\" and consider all the evidence available.\nChristopher Dye, professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, told the BBC that vaccine passports would \"certainly be helpful in releasing the lockdown\" but they should not \"make things worse for people of lesser means\".\nMr Johnson said his roadmap for easing lockdown measures, laid out on Monday, was \"a cautious but irreversible approach\".\nDue to the vaccine programme, the country could \"look at that 21 June date with some optimism\".\nMr Johnson said each phase of unlocking restrictions -  such as children going back to school -  would be \"adding to the budget of risk\". \nThis is why time was needed between measures to \"observe\" the impact, he added.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted measures to become a \"matter of personal responsibility and social norms\" that could see people choosing to wear masks on public transport.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nOutlining her own roadmap, Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to end stay at home restrictions from 5 April in Scotland.\nMeanwhile in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the country's \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England."

Under the new law, a spouse is entitled to seek compensation in a divorce if he or she bears more responsibility in child raising, caring for elderly relatives, and assisting partners in their work. \nPreviously, divorcing spouses could only request  such compensation if a prenuptial agreement had been signed - an uncommon practice in China. \nOn social media, the case sparked heated debate, with a related hashtag on microblogging platform Weibo viewed more than 570 million times. \nSome social media users pointed out that 50,000 yuan for five years' of work was too little. \"I'm a bit speechless, the work of a full-time housewife is being underestimated. In Beijing, hiring a nanny for a year costs more than 50,000 yuan,\" said one commenter.\nOthers pointed out that men should assume more household duties in the first place.\nSome also called on women to continue pursuing their careers after marriage. \"Ladies, remember to always be independent. Don't give up work after marriage, give yourself your own way out,\" wrote one social media user.\nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Chinese women spend nearly four hours a day on unpaid work - roughly 2.5 times that of men. \nIt is higher than the average in OECD countries, where women spend twice the amount of time as men on unpaid work.\nTwo women in the UK share their stories of juggling senior jobs with unpaid caring responsibilities (video from 2019)."

Father-of-one Mr Geddes let him stay in his flat but was then attacked.\nSandra Geddes, 65, told BBC Scotland News she believed her younger brother's death was \"absolutely avoidable\".\nQuinn had a record of violent behaviour, and Ms Geddes said: \"It should never have happened.\"\nScotland's justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, has now offered to meet the family to discuss their concerns. \nQuinn was jailed for a minimum of 18 years last week for the murder.\nThe High Court in Glasgow was told he had been freed just the day before the killing, after previous convictions for assault.\nQuinn was said to be \"upset and crying\" on his release and was due to receive help for personal issues.\nUnable to find a bed, he ended up in a lap dancing club in the city. Mr Geddes was also there with a friend, and chatted with Quinn.\nMr Geddes - a former model - offered to pay for Quinn to stay at a hotel, but it was full so he allowed Quinn into his flat in the city's Ruthrieston Crescent.\nMr Geddes was later found lying at the bottom of stairs with multiple injuries.\nPolice arrived to find Quinn clutching a knife, which he threw down, and he admitted what he had done.\nQuinn initially stated he had stabbed Mr Geddes in self-defence but Mr Geddes had injuries suggesting he tried to ward off the killer.\nHis sister said \"red flags\" had been missed in the case.\nShe said of her brother's death: \"My instant reaction was devastation - couldn't believe that it had happened. Since then I have been desperate to find out what exactly happened to him.\n\"I didn't know anything about Stuart Quinn, then to hear about his past, his convictions, I understood that there was more to this.\n\"There was a pattern here of violence, I think in the past he had reached out for help, and there was nobody there listening to him.\"\nShe explained: \"There's been a breakdown on communications here. Prior instances that were flagged were ignored.\n\"I think he had a switch and Alan was the one who paid the price for it.\"\nMs Geddes said the murder of the \"popular guy\" had \"broken\" the family.\n\"It's unbelievable this has happened to Alan when he was just trying to help someone and I can see my brother doing that, feeling sorry for him\", she said.\n\"It makes me extremely disappointed in our criminal justice system. I've never sat down with Stuart Quinn but the signs were all there and they were ignored.\n\"Alan I don't think had a chance. I think he just flipped that night. He thought he was protecting himself.\n\"To send him for a bed and it's actually closed - that is such a fundamental mistake that as been made to allow that lad out knowing he was crying and needing help.\"\nAsked if his death was avoidable, she said: \"Absolutely. It should never have happened. That makes it harder.\n\"He suffered an extremely violent death. I wonder what his last thoughts were. I will live this for the rest of my life\".\n\"It should have been prevented\".\nNic Flavell, 44, a former neighbour of Quinn's, said he found him in his house in Westhill, Aberdeenshire, in 2018.\n\"He was holding a screwdriver\", he said.\nMr Flavell said Quinn walked towards him, swinging the screwdriver, and they then fought, while his girlfriend and children hid and tried to raise the alarm. Neighbours started to help, before police arrived and he was detained.\nMr Flavell said there had also been another incident involving neighbours with Quinn and a baseball bat.\nMr Flavell said of the Geddes family: \"I am heartbroken for the family - it was all avoidable.\"\nThe Scottish government said in a statement: \"Our thoughts and sympathies are with Mr Geddes' family.  While nothing can ease the pain of losing a loved-one, we note the life sentence imposed on the person responsible for this terrible crime.\n\"We are working with prison, health and local authority partners to continue reducing reoffending - strengthening the management of prison leavers to reduce risk and keep people safe.\n\"We are also improving support for victims' relatives, including creating a service specifically to help those bereaved by crime.\"\nSupt Neil McDonald, of Police Scotland's North East Division, said: \"The murder of Alan Geddes was investigated thoroughly by Police Scotland and Stuart Quinn was quickly arrested, charged and pled guilty. Our thoughts remain with Alan's family and friends who have suffered a terrible loss. \n\"We have not received any complaints about the police handling of this case. If anyone wishes to raise concerns we would ask them to come forward and speak to us.\"\nNo other incidents of violence were reported to police involving Quinn in the Westhill area at the time.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service said: \"The SPS does not comment on individual cases\".\nAberdeen City Council said: \"Aberdeen City Council's homelessness services operate 24/7, 365 days per year.\u00a0There is no record of Mr Quinn presenting to Aberdeen City Council for support.\" "

      "text": "Boris Johnson has a \"blind spot\" when it comes to appointing LGBT+ people to his top team, the UK's first openly gay cabinet minister has suggested.\nLord Chris Smith, who was a member of Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997, said it was a \"matter of great regret\" that there were currently no out cabinet ministers.\nHe urged the PM to diversify his top team in \"the next year or two\".\nA government spokesman said Mr Johnson was committed to improving diversity.\nThe UK parliament now has its highest ever proportion of lesbian, gay and bisexual MPs, including two non-cabinet ministers, although there are no openly transgender members of parliament. \nLord Smith, who was also the first openly gay male MP after coming out in 1984, said electing a trans member of parliament was a \"glass ceiling\" yet to be broken. \n\"In terms of lesbians and gay men I think the glass ceiling in Parliament has well and truly been broken,\" he said in an interview to mark LGBT+ History month.\n\"The glass ceiling in the cabinet has been broken by quite a number of us over the years. Sadly at present they seem to want to put it back in again.\" \nJustine Greening who was the first and, as things stand, only out lesbian cabinet minister thinks it's more of a \"pipeline\" issue - that not as many LGBT+ MPs have risen through the ranks as had been hoped.\nMs Greening served in Theresa May's Conservative cabinet, as education secretary and equalities minister, alongside Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, who also came out while in office. \n\"There wasn't maybe quite that level of a pipeline behind us that maybe we'd hoped for,\" said Ms Greening. \n\"I think having people from all walks of society really really matters and I think that's how you get better decision making.\" \nLord Smith said that having LGBT+ people in high office sends out a \"positive message\" that \"this is something to be proud about, to be open about, to feel confident about being yourself\". \nThe peer and former Labour cabinet minister claims Boris Johnson's main priority in choosing his first cabinet was to ensure they were on board with his Brexit policy, but he says the PM should now cast his net wider. \nHe urged Mr Johnson to \"look to the greater talent that is out there and it will include some people who happen to be lesbian or gay\". \nJustine Greening, who also campaigns on social mobility, said that the government has had \"an exceptionally challenging time\" tackling Covid but, she suggested, a future reshuffle could be a time for change.\n\"Hopefully\u2026 as the vaccine progresses\u2026 we can look to a life almost beyond and I think it's that moment then that there's a big debate to be had about not just levelling up but how do you make Britain a fairer place.\"\nA government spokesperson said the prime minister was \"immensely proud to live in a country that is one of the most progressive and liberal when it comes to LGBT equality\",\n\"The UK government is proactively working with other countries to improve LGBT rights internationally\" they added.\n\"The PM has committed to doing more to make sure the government fully represents the people it serves.\""

      "text": "Wales will be the first UK nation to have offered the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh Government has said.\nWithin hours, officials say, all over-70s including care home residents, will have been offered a first dose.\nWales and the other UK nations have aimed to hit the target by mid-February.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford thanked \"everyone who had been working around the clock to reach this point\".\nIt follows a warning that vaccine supplies will fall in the coming weeks.\nThe UK Government's Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales' milestone was \"fantastic news\" and testament to the continued effort made by NHS and military staff.\nThe country currently leads the UK in the percentage of the population that has received a first jab - at least 715,944 doses have been given out.\nFigures up to Thursday night show 22.7% of the population have been vaccinated, compared to 21% in England, 20.4% in Scotland and 19.7% in Northern Ireland.\nBut there were more than 87,000 people from target groups, including more than 37,000 in their early 70s, still to get a first dose.\nThe picture is complicated by a built-in delay on data being published while figures are checked and verified.\nThere are also issues involving some care home residents having to wait for doses, because of isolation due to Covid outbreaks.\nBut Mr Drakeford said he was confident the programme remained on track - with plans remaining in place to reach the next five priority groups by the spring.\nHe said: \"We're the first UK nation to reach this milestone, others will follow in a couple of days.\"\nAsked how many people in those top groups who will not have had vaccine appointments by the weekend, he said it would be \"a very small number\".\n\"We've already completed 92% of all the people in those priority groups thanks to the amazing efforts of our NHS and other staff,\" he said. \n\"There will be some people who were ill when they were offered and need to be re-book. There will be some people who chose not to have a vaccine when they were first offered it, who may have changed their minds.\"\nMr Drakeford said the NHS was \"checking and rechecking\" whether anyone had been left out and final appointments were being arranged for the weekend.\n\"Anybody who knows of somebody who may have missed out, it is not too late at all,\" he said.\n\"We will make sure that those people have an appointment as fast as possible.\"\nHealth minister Vaughan Gething said \"a leave no-one behind approach\" was being taken. \n\"The next group, those people 65 and over, all health boards are already sending out invites for those people to come forward as well,\" he said. \n\"We're not looking to miss a step, we're carrying on with the vaccine we have available.\"\nThe top four priority groups include:\nFigures show 88.4% of those aged 80 or older have had a first dose, compared to 86.3% for 75 to 79 year olds and 79.8% of 70 to 74 year olds.\nPublic Health Wales said a total of 80.3% of care home residents have had a first dose, and 83.5% of care home workers.\nBritish Medical Association chairman Dr David Bailey said Wales was \"hopefully on the home straight\".\nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"People are really making an effort to make the thing go smoothly as possible, and it is a credit to the Welsh public, as well as everyone who has actually been delivering the vaccine, because it has gone smoothly and everyone has been trying to do their part.\"\nMr Drakeford said: \"To have achieved this first milestone and offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups - those who are most vulnerable to coronavirus - is a truly phenomenal effort. \n\"Of course, the hard work has only just begun - there are many, many more people to vaccinate yet and a lot of second doses still to give.\"\nWelsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the milestone a \"true British and Welsh success story\".\nHe said it showed the UK Government had \"ensured Wales has had the vaccines available to protect the most vulnerable in our society and meet this target\" and hoped Wales could soon reopen its economy.\nHowever he added there was a still a \"long way to go\" with 80% of the population yet to be offered the vaccine.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was thanks to NHS staff and volunteers \"that Wales has been able to accelerate the vaccination effort to its current levels\".\nMr ap Iorwerth added his party would continue to call for \"those in all care settings, not just the elderly, to be vaccinated as a matter of priority, and for key workers in schools, the emergency services and public transport to be brought in to the priority system sooner.\""

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "tags": "Companies,Stock markets,Reddit,GameStop",
      "text": "Shares in GameStop surged on Wednesday in what could mark a return to frenzied trading that rocked markets last month.\nTrading in the US games firm was halted twice after shares more than doubled suddenly on Wednesday afternoon.\nGameStop stock climbed by 104% until trading was halted for a second time - moments before markets closed.\nThe rapid rise came as Reddit, the online home of activist investors that led the GameStop movement in January, went down temporarily.\nThe stock gained nearly 90% in after-hours trading.\nIt came one day after the firm announced its chief financial officer Jim Bell would resign next month to help \"accelerate GameStop's transformation\".\nSome investors have talked publicly and posted on social media site Reddit about not selling their shares in GameStop during last month's volatile trading because of what they see as its long-term potential.\nOn Wednesday, Reddit was down for many users. The company did not say what caused the outage but said it had identified the issue, fixed it and that \"systems are beginning to recover.\"\nIt is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.\nMajor hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall.\nBut they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites like Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in one week.\nThe retail trading frenzy drew concern from regulators and has even led to a Congressional hearing in the US.\nKeith Gill, who became a key player in the trading and is known as 'Roaring Kitty' on YouTube, has also been hit with a class action lawsuit. He allegedly duped retail investors into buying inflated stocks while hiding his sophisticated financial background.\nMr Gill has downplayed his impact and rebutted claims he violated any laws.\n\"The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,\" Mr Gill said in the prepared testimony.\n\"I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel.\"\nThe GameStop saga was hailed as a victory of the little guys against big Wall Street hedge funds that were betting against video games retailer GameStop and other struggling businesses.\nBut it is unclear what role hedge funds had in the rally, as some are reported to have made millions from the GameStop share rally that was inspired by Reddit users.\nThe key part of the theory of why GameStop shares went up so high in January was a 'short squeeze'. \nThis is when hedge funds, who'd bet GameStop shares would fall, tried to buy them back when the share price began to rise. \nThat in turn pushed the price even higher. Some hedge funds lost hundreds of millions of pounds.\nThe prevailing view was that hedge funds wouldn't put themselves into that position again. That they would be all over Reddit and more careful about 'shorting'.  Therefore, you wouldn't see a giant spike in the share price again. \nBut evidently, that view was wrong. That the share price, in just a few hours, could explode again tests some of the assumptions about what happened last month. \nIt's often very difficult to understand exactly what drives a share price, and who is driving it. \nBut it does once again appear that the hype on WallStreetBets, the influential subreddit, was part of the rise. \nReddit even went down at one point, though it's not clear yet whether that was because of an increase in activity on the site. \nPolicy makers will be looking on closely. At a hearing last week in Washington, many politicians were concerned that 'meme stocks' could spike again. \nThat can be beneficial to some investors when the stock is rising. But on the way down amateur investors can get burnt too. \nIf these kinds of spikes become more common, expect more pressure on legislators to step in. "

Now they have some rough indication, pencilled in to the calendar, but far from all of them, and with distancing still required.\nIn contrast with Boris Johnson's approach for England, Nicola Sturgeon's statement at Holyrood was not a route map to a late summer of socialising, concerts, sports and travel. \nThe plan is far more cautious. Nicola Sturgeon's idea of release, maybe by late April, is to get through the doors of a restaurant or bar.\nBoth leaders had said they were putting data ahead of dates, but it was the prime minister's dates that the public notice, remember and plan on. Travel bookings soared on Monday and Tuesday.\nScotland's first minister is warning that dates are not much better than \"a finger in the wind\", and depend on a lot of data variables to reach each point. Scotland's travel and tourism industry isn't being given much to plan on.\nSo by the final week of April, the mainland and most islands may be allowed to ease off, but only to level three. \nThat should mean pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with tight constraints.\nWhen does it mean you can book a holiday in another part of Scotland? We don't know, but we do know the answer will vary around Scotland. Unlike England, it's returning to regions and council areas to determine where rules can be relaxed and where they can't.\nWhat about a foreign holiday? There's nothing in the new plan that even indicates an end to hotel isolation for inbound travellers.\nCan Scotland's events sector get to work with planning festivals? Not for \"a considerable period ahead\", according to the Scottish government framework, and it promises to work with sector representatives to get to their own route map.\nIt's only after running through the educational, health and social priorities for easing lockdown that the Scottish government's strategy reaches business support. Funding continues, in grant schemes funded through Holyrood and councils.\nIncome support schemes, including furlough, are expected to get another lease of life from Rishi Sunak in his Westminster budget next week. \nGrants for firms forced to close in Scotland are to be run four weeks past their reopening day, and some may be further tapered after that. \nBusiness bosses complain, however, the grants don't go far enough and furlough comes with employer costs. \nTo continue burning through cash will be a severe stretch for many firms, still looking into a cloudy and uncertainty future beyond April."

Get in touch.\nLockdowns and travel restrictions imposed in 2020 to try to limit the global spread of coronavirus hit the aviation sector hard.\nHeathrow normally has about 80 million passengers per year, but it said numbers in 2020 dropped to 22 million, with more than half of those travelling in January and February before the coronavirus crisis took hold.\nIn the long-term, if passenger numbers were to drop below 27 million, Heathrow would be in danger of breaching deals it has with creditors, it said.\nIn January, the government opened a financial support scheme for airports in England, which included \u00a38m per applicant to be used to cover fixed costs such as business rates.\nOn Wednesday, Heathrow called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next week's Budget to extend the furlough scheme and give a 100% business rates holiday to give additional support to the aviation sector.\nHeathrow doesn't have many passengers at the moment, but one thing it does have a lot of is borrowing.\nThe London airport has built a \u00a315bn debt pile in the past decade while paying its shareholders several billion pounds in dividends.\nThe collapse in traffic caused by the coronavirus pandemic has understandably put a strain on its finances, to the extent that the company has asked the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), its economic regulator, for an increase in prices to compensate.\nThe request has outraged its airline customers, who say they and their passengers should not have to pick up the airport's pandemic tab.\nThere is no danger of Heathrow running out of money in the short term - it has about \u00a34bn in cash, enough to keep it ticking over for two years - but the accounts do include a warning about the future.\nThe directors say that the uncertainty about the timescale and nature of the recovery from the pandemic \"indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which could cast significant doubt upon the group and the company's ability to continue as a going concern\".\nIt would take a serious prolongation of traffic restrictions for Heathrow's current financial structure to crack - but the warning underlines why the company is pressing the CAA so hard for a price increase. \nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) has also pleaded with governments to continue their financial support for the aviation sector.\nThe industry body warned on Wednesday that airlines could continue to burn cash into 2022 amid uncertainty around when restrictions will ease. It estimated that aviation firms burnt through $77bn (\u00a354.6bn) in cash during the second half of 2020 alone.\nIts boss Alexandre de Juniac told the BBC: \"The crisis is not over. \n\"If you want us to be alive when the restart will come, when the traffic will recover, which is not before the second half of 2021... We need support with additional financial help.\"\nIt is currently working on a \"Covid travel pass\", an app which could be used to verify if a passenger has had the Covid-19 tests or vaccines required to enter a country.\nThe director general said in a BBC interview on Wednesday that it is talking to the UK government about using its app. \nHe played down concerns about the security of any app-based system: \"It's pretty well done and designed for that purpose\". \nMr de Juniac said the focus was on passengers controlling their data and that \"there is no information that is stored in any database that the government control or IATA control at all.\""

      "text": "American fashion designer Alexander Wang is facing further allegations of sexual misconduct.\nKeaton Bullen, 21, a student at New York's Parsons School of Design, has alleged to BBC News he was assaulted by Mr Wang at a club in the city in 2019.\nIt comes as the high-profile lawyer Lisa Bloom says she is now representing 11 men with misconduct allegations against Mr Wang.\nMr Wang robustly denies all the claims made against him.\nMr Bullen, then 20, was with a friend at the Fishbowl club in New York City when he says he encountered Alexander Wang on 24 August 2019 at about 11:30pm.\nHe told the BBC they had initially talked about their mutual alma mater, Parsons School of Design in lower Manhattan, where Mr Bullen is currently studying interior design. \nMr Wang then invited the pair to his table and and offered them vodka by the bottle before eventually leading him to the dance floor, Mr Bullen said.\nIn the early hours of the morning, Mr Bullen alleged, Mr Wang sexually assaulted him.\n\"All of a sudden he unzipped my trousers, put his hands in my pants and started grabbing my penis in front of a bunch of people,\" he said. \"I completely froze.\n\"He then said: 'I want to take you home with me,'\" Mr Bullen alleged. \"I felt weirded out... and removed myself from the situation as fast as possible.\"\nPaul Tweed, one of Mr Wang's lawyers, said he was currently awaiting CCTV footage of the club from the night which he said \"his client believes will totally disprove this allegation\".\nMr Bullen said he felt a duty to speak out to support others who had come forward with allegations and were being called \"liars\".\nHe is not taking legal action and said he did not want his photo used, out of concern the public would accuse him of seeking attention.\nAllegations against Mr Wang previously emerged in December after a British model claimed on TikTok that the designer had groped him during a concert at a New York City nightclub in January 2017.\nIn the video, which subsequently went viral, Owen Mooney, 26, said: \"I was by myself at one point and this guy next to me obviously took advantage of the fact that no one could move.\n\"And he just started touching me up. Fully up my leg, in my crotch. It made me freeze completely because I was in so much shock.\"\nTwo fashion watchdog Instagram accounts, @DietPrada and @ShitModelManagement, then began sharing several anonymous claims of sexual misconduct against the designer.\nMr Mooney later criticised what he called the \"radio silence\" from the fashion and film industries in response to the allegations, which affected people who were \"male, queer and trans\".\n\"It seems #MeToo quite possibly could be lacking in inclusivity,\" he said on social media.\nIn a statement at the time, Mr Wang denied the allegations as \"baseless and grotesquely false\" and said he would \"hold accountable\" those responsible for spreading them.\nMr Mooney, from Peterborough, is one of 11 people being represented by the victim's rights lawyer Lisa Bloom, who has led a number of high-profile sexual harassment cases.\nShe told the BBC most of the alleged incidents were linked to LGBT clubs and that no legal action had yet been taken.\nAllegations about Alexander Wang's conduct first circulated online four years ago.\nNick Ward, 28, who works in construction, alleged on Twitter that Mr Wang had grabbed his crotch at the Brooklyn Mirage nightclub in New York after midnight on 10 September 2017.\nMr Wang denies the claim and being at the club that night.\nDJ Gia Garrison, now 24, described a similar encounter with the designer on Facebook.\nShe recently told the BBC they had met in the VIP area of the club Slake in Manhattan in February 2017 during one of her favourite monthly party nights called Holy Mountain.\nAvant-garde in theme, for the occasion she proudly remembers wearing a big red cloak her friend had made, over bikini bottoms and thigh-high boots.\n\"I like being able to show my body and feel comfortable and free,\" she said. \"There's no judgement and it's a space where everyone can love their bodies and embrace themselves.\"\nAround 2:30am she recalled heading to the VIP area with her friends and, shortly after, being introduced to Mr Wang.  \n\"I was dancing near him when he reached out his hand, grabbed my bikini bottoms and dragged it downward in front of everyone,\" nearly revealing her genitals, she alleged. \n\"As a trans woman with discomfort about certain parts of myself that I've since grown to love, I don't want someone to expose my entire body like that,\" she added.\nMr Wang's lawyer denied the allegation and said his client had \"never grabbed any woman\" in this way.\nOne of Lisa Bloom's clients, David Casavant, recently alleged to The New York Times that Mr Wang had pulled down his pants and underwear at a club in New York in the same year.\nMs Garrison, who also works as a model and music producer, said she did not believe in \"cancel culture\" but has since refused to wear Alexander Wang's clothing lines on set.\n\"I think it's dangerous and doesn't solve a problem,\" she said. \"What really matters is if the person truly works on themselves, educates themselves and decides to make a change.\"\nIn a statement released in the New Year when the allegations escalated, Mr Wang, 37, said: \"Seeing these lies about me being perpetuated as truths has been infuriating. \n\"I have never engaged in the atrocious behaviour described and would never conduct myself in the manner that's been alleged.\"\nFollow Rianna on Twitter @The_Crox"

      "text": "The Museums Association has voiced concern over what it sees as government \"interference\" into how museums present Britain's imperial history.\n\"It is not for ministers to dictate what constitutes a legitimate subject for investigation,\" the body said.\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden held a meeting on Tuesday with representatives from leading heritage organisations.\nThe government said: \"We absolutely support the independence of museums and heritage organisations.\"\nWriting on Twitter after Tuesday's virtual meeting, Mr Dowden described it as a \"very productive conversation about protecting heritage for future generations\".\nHe said a working group would be set up and guidelines published to put the government's \"retain and explain\" policy into practice.\nThe toppling of slave trader Edward Colston's statue in Bristol last year, along with other campaigns, have led to a heated debate about whether and how historical objects linked to Britain's colonial past should be displayed.\nIn September, culture minister Matt Warman told MPs the UK's heritage should not be removed from view, \"however contentious\" it might be.\nHe said an effort should be made to \"contextualise or reinterpret\" memorials and artefacts \"in a way that enables the public to learn about them in their entirety\".\nThe National Trust was among the organisations at Tuesday's virtual discussion, and said it had been \"helpful and productive\". Historic England, which was also represented, said it would work with the government \"to help people understand on a deeper level the many layers of our shared past\".\nSir Ian Blatchford, head of the Science Museum Group and chair of the National Museum Directors' Council, said: \"The meeting was a timely exchange about the importance of telling a balanced and well-researched history of Britain, and a moment to dispel some of the mischief-making around this event.\n\"The independence of museums is not at issue, and UK museums remain as committed as ever to the brilliant and diverse storytelling that our audiences so value.\"\nAccording to Museums Association director Sharon Heal, however, the government's \"perceived interference\" on matters relating to empire and slavery is a subject for concern.\n\"It is both a hallmark of a democratic society and a cornerstone of museum ethics that our sector should operate at arms-length from the government,\" she said.\n\"It is vital that the government consults widely with the sector - including with the Museums Association - before proceeding with its proposal to produce guidelines on 'contested heritage'.\n\"We are particularly concerned that a climate of fear has been created amongst museums and museum staff, especially those working on subjects relating to Britain's imperial past.\"\nAround 15,000 workers from the UK's heritage sector are members of the Museums Association.\nIn response, a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"We have been crystal clear that we absolutely support the independence of museums and heritage organisations and the National Museums Directors' Council has acknowledged this.\n\"The meeting this week with Arm's Length Bodies and other stakeholders was the start of a conversation about how we work together to protect our heritage for future generations. Public funded bodies recognise that they have a responsibility to act impartially, in line with their status.\"\nThe Imperial War Museum, National Portrait Gallery, British Film Institute, British Museum and Horniman Museum are among other organisations understood to have participated in Tuesday's discussion.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Tiger Woods: The triumphs and troubles of golf superstar",
      "tags": "United States",
      "text": "Tiger Woods is in hospital after suffering multiple leg injuries in a car crash. Many from the golfing world and beyond are wishing him a swift and full recovery, but some fear this could mark the end of the 45-year-old's glittering career.\nSo what more do we know about the man considered by many to be the greatest golfer of all time?\nAs young as 10 months, Wood's eye for a ball and an impressive swing had been spotted by his father Earl, who fashioned him a set of clubs and was his earliest teacher.\nAt two, his potential was already getting wider notice and he was invited onto a TV show alongside the legendary comedian Bob Hope to show off his skills. \nJust months later, he won a competition for children under 10 - and so began a dazzling ascent through the junior game that saw him win tournament after tournament, collecting accolades and breaking records as he went.\nBy the time he turned professional in 1996, he had won six USGA national championships and an unprecedented three consecutive US amateur titles.\nIn 1997, a year after he turned pro, Woods won his first professional major, the Masters.\nHe was only 21 and had not only become the tournament's youngest winner and first person of colour crowned champion, but he had also become the youngest golfer to be ranked No 1 in the world.\nBy 2008, he had won 14 major golfing titles, and he jointly holds the record for most PGA Tour wins at 82 with Sam Snead and is three behind Jack Nicklaus' mark of 18 major titles.\nAlong with the championship wins came the sponsorship deals, and his deals with Nike and Titleist in the early days of his pro career were some of the most lucrative ever seen in golf at the time.\nOver the course of his career, Woods has earned $1.5bn (\u00a31.05bn) from endorsements, appearances and course design fees, according to Forbes magazine.\nIn 2004, his gilded life seemed complete when he married former model Elin Nordegren, the daughter of a Swedish politician and radio journalist, and had two children - Sam, a daughter, born in 2007, and son Charlie in 2009.\nHis father Earl Woods, a lieutenant colonel in the US army, was of African-American, Chinese and Native American descent. His mother, Kultida, is of Thai, Chinese and Dutch descent.\nThe golfing champion told Oprah Winfrey in 1997 that it bothered him when people called him an African-American.\n\"Growing up, I came up with this name: I'm a Cablinasian,\" he said, to describe his heritage mix of Caucasian, black, Indian and Asian.\nWoods' achievements in golf have been that much more impressive for a game that has traditionally been seen as the preserve of white, middle class Christians.\nIn his 2017 book on winning the Masters for the first time, he said that, while he hoped his win \"would open some doors for minorities\", his biggest hope was \"we could one day see one another as people and people alone. I want us to be colour blind. Twenty years later, that has yet to happen\".  \nIt began with a story, in November 2009, that Woods had been in his car when it sped out of his Florida driveway, collided with a fire hydrant and ploughed into a neighbour's tree.\nIn the days and weeks that followed, the world learnt that he had been cheating on his wife and was in fact a serial philanderer. The proud champion that appeared to have everything was, in fact, a deeply flawed individual.\nHe took a break from golf, checked into rehab for what was widely rumoured to be treatment for sex addiction. In February 2010, he gave a 14-minute televised statement in which he apologised for his \"irresponsible and selfish behaviour\".\nTiger and Elin eventually divorced, and the golfer dated US skier Lindsey Vonn before settling into a long-term relationship with Erica Herman, general manager of his restaurant in Jupiter, Florida.\nIn 2019, Tiger Woods seemed to have put his troubled decade behind him when he won the Masters at Augusta - his 15th major title, and the first one for 11 years.\nHis victory was watched by his two children, something he described as coming \"full circle\". \"My dad was here in 1997 and now I'm the dad with two kids here,\" he said at the time.\nBut he also described the win as \"one of the hardest\" because of his ongoing back problems, which, between 2013 and 2017 saw him start just 24 events.\nIn 2017, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car, later pleading guilty to reckless driving.\nHe had five prescription drugs in his system at the time of his arrest. He had been recovering from spinal fusion surgery that ultimately gave him the chance at a second golfing career.\nWoods earlier this week said he hoped to play in this year's Masters after having a fifth operation on his back in January. \n\"I'm feeling fine - I'm a little stiff,\" Woods told CBS Television on Sunday. \"I have one more MRI scheduled so we'll see then if I can start doing more activities.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether the man who has bounced back from many obstacles in the past will be able to surmount the challenges facing him after this latest car crash."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Live music,Reading,Music festivals,Leeds,Music",
      "text": "Reading and Leeds Festival organisers say they are \"very confident\" the events will go ahead this summer, after plans to ease lockdown were announced.\nUnder the government's plan, limits on social contact in England could be gone by 21 June, if Covid is under control.\nThe twin-site festival is due to take place from 27 to 29 August.\n\"The good news is that we can be very confident that Reading and Leeds is going to take place,\" festival boss Melvin Benn told BBC Radio 1.\nAsked how the event could go ahead when others like Glastonbury had been forced to cancel, he told Radio 1's Newsbeat: \"In fairness, we haven't done it, the government have done it. The government are vaccinating everybody and that's how it's going to happen.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, Reading and Leeds' Twitter feed posted a message saying: \"Following the government's recent announcement, we can't wait to get back to the fields this summer. Let's go!\"\nStormzy, Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age have already been announced as headliners, with Mabel, AJ Tracey and Doja Cat also on the line-up.\n\"The acts are desperate to play, the kids are desperate to come,\" said Benn. \"I can feel that.\"\nThe promoter told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he believed all adults would be offered a second vaccine by mid-August - two or three weeks before Reading and Leeds.\n\"The one thing that we can say about the prime minister is that, in terms of the vaccination roll-out, almost uniquely in the world, he has got it right,\" Benn said.\n\"I applaud him for that, and I am going to hold his feet to the fire on it. And I think there's going to be 200,000 young people holding his feet to the fire on that position as well.\"\nSuffolk's Latitude festival, which is also run by Benn's company Festival Republic, is expected to make an announcement about its plans for 2021 in the near future,  he added.\nLast year, he told MPs his events could not go ahead while social distancing was in place. However, he said live music could resume with mass testing of fans. It is unclear what measures will be in place this summer.\nReading and Leeds is regarded by many fans as second only to Glastonbury in the annual UK music calendar. Originally a rock festival, it has seen legendary performances by Nirvana, Oasis, Guns N' Roses and Paramore.\nMore recently, it has embraced dance and hip-hop, with high-profile slots for The Prodigy, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone. This year, the festival is due to host about 200,000 fans at Richfield Avenue in Reading and Bramham Park in Leeds, with two main stages at each site.\nThe festival's bullish announcement comes less than 48 hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his four-step plan for easing restrictions.\nUnder the proposals, outdoor hospitality, including drive-in cinemas, could re-open as part of step two in April. Pilots of indoor live events, with social distancing, could also commence at the same time. \nStep three, which would start no earlier that 17 May, could allow limited indoor mixing. Indoor concerts would have a limit of 1,000 people or 50% of a venue's maximum capacity. Outdoor concerts and sporting events would have an upper limit of 4,000 people - or 10,000 for seated events.\nThe roadmap gives no guarantee for those dates, with every step dependent on slowing the spread of Covid-19.\nBenn said he thought it was unlikely the timetable would change. \"Why would it?\" he asked, adding that \"we have to, at some point, start planning for life to go back\" to normal.\nDr Google, manager of rap act Bad Boy Chiller Crew, who are due to play Reading and Leeds, added: \"Obviously anything can get cancelled but... I don't think the music industry could last another 12 months without any live events\".\nThe industry has largely welcomed the timeline for the lifting of lockdown restrictions in England. However, it warned that live music was \"at the back of the queue to re-open\" and may still need financial assistance.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Schools,Gavin Williamson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "No child should have their prospects \"blighted by the pandemic\", the education secretary has said.\nGavin Williamson was speaking at a Downing Street briefing as he set out \u00a3700m in funding to help pupils in England catch up on missed learning.\nAsked about what would replace exam grades this year, he said they were \"putting trust\" in teachers.\nIt comes as the number of people to receive one dose of the vaccine in the UK surpassed 18 million. \nA further 9,938 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Wednesday, as well as 442 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to government figures. It takes the death toll by that measure to 121,747. \nLabour said the government should put forward a \"long-term plan... not just a quick fix over the summer\".\nThe government has confirmed that all schools will open from 8 March, as part of the first step of a roadmap for easing England's lockdown.\nAs part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year.\nThe government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend.\nMr Williamson said the funding announcements were about offering \"immediate\" support for children and schools.\nBut the education secretary said many children would need longer term support, and \"extensive work\" was under way on plans for that.\nHe said: \"We're going to make sure we do everything can do to make sure children reach their potential - while looking at all issues - and we're not going to be timid in aspirations for them and the actions we need to take.\"\nThe government's \u00a3700m education support package for England includes:\nHe also reiterated that there would be \"no algorithms whatsoever\" used in determining A-level, AS and GCSE grades, with marks \"firmly in the hands of teachers\". \nIt has already been announced that exams will not take place. \nThe minister said there would be a \"clear and robust\" appeals mechanism for students who are unhappy with their results.\nFurther details on how students in England will be graded this year will be set out on Thursday.\nThe challenge for the education secretary is to keep sounding as though he has a new plan for what everyone can see is a massive problem with no obvious easy answers.\nChildren have missed a huge amount of school and exams have been cancelled for two years running.\nThe latest announcement on catch-up has an extra \u00a3400m, but it's focused on a familiar check list - summer schools, tuition, after-school activities, much of which happens anyway and with schools deciding how it will be spent.\nGavin Williamson told Wednesday's press conference that the government was \"not going to be timid\", but the reports about radical plans such as longer school days and shorter holidays seem to have fizzled away.\nThe unshowy and highly-experienced school recovery tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, will be more interested in long-term results than show-boating headlines.\nThe education secretary ran through the plans for pupils going back to school - from 8 March with testing and masks - and that date offers families some certainty.\nAlthough university students must think they are being kept in an expensive limbo, with no date yet set for when many of them can return.\nThe education secretary also defended the requirement for pupils in secondary schools to wear face masks in classrooms. \nHe said it was a \"temporary\" measure that would be reviewed over the Easter break. \nAsked if the government was looking at lengthening the school day in the future, Mr Williamson said it was not part of the immediate plans announced, but it could be something considered as part of a wider consultation being led by education recovery commissioner Sir Kevan Collins into the longer term support and change needed within schools following the pandemic.\nThis week, the government announced that secondary school and college students in England will be asked to take regular coronavirus tests at home when they return to school next month.\nDeputy chief medical officer for England Jenny Harries said more testing in secondary schools would mean that parents, teachers and grandparents could be reassured that schools would be as safe as they could be. \nThese measures would have a positive impact on breaking the chains of transmission, she said. \nBut she warned that \"children should not go hugging grandparents too much\" before the the impact of the vaccine rollout was felt.\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the impact of lost learning for children was now \"baked in\" and she was sceptical about whether the catch-up tutoring programme would reach many of the children who needed it most.\nShe also said there needed to be a \"really robust moderation process to make sure that children are treated fairly... a robust appeals process\" and time for schools and exam boards to assess pupils and standardise results. \nIn Scotland, younger primary pupils have gone back to school, along with some exam year students in secondary schools. A wider reopening has yet to be decided.\nIn Wales, younger primary years also returned on Monday - with older primary pupils set to go back on 15 March if Covid levels continue to fall.\nIn Northern Ireland, younger primary pupils will return to classrooms on 8 March.\nLast year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a \u00a31bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan as education recovery commissioner.\nIn Scotland, the administration has promised \u00a3140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to \"help boost growth\" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Art",
      "text": "A Vincent Van Gogh painting of a Paris street has gone on display for the first time after spending more than 100 years behind closed doors.\nA Street Scene In Montmartre has been owned by a French family for most of the time since it was painted in 1887.\nSotheby's estimates it could fetch up to eight million euros (\u00a36.9m) when it is sold at auction next month.\nVan Gogh expert Martin Bailey told BBC News that this is \"the first time we are able to see it properly\".\nSmall reproductions have been made in the past, often in black-and-white. \"What is exciting is that it is a Van Gogh painting which has been hidden away ever since it came off the artist's easel,\" Mr Bailey said.\n\"It has always been in private collections, so only the owners and their friends knew it. \n\"It is an interesting picture because it is a transitional work between Van Gogh's Dutch years, when he painted in dark, earthy colours, and the exuberant works that he did in Provence. It was in Paris that he discovered the Impressionists, and this led him to explore colour.\"\nIt is one of a series of works Van Gogh created while lodging with his brother Theo in 1886 and 1887 a short distance from the street depicted in the painting.\nThe estimated price tag of five to eight million euros reflects the fact that the artist's Paris paintings do not fetch the \"mega sums\" of his Provence paintings, added Mr Bailey, who writes a blog on Van Gogh for The Art Newspaper.\n\"But until the hammer goes down, one obviously never knows what will happen at an auction. There is now a great deal of interest in Van Gogh in the Far East, so the Van Gogh market is truly global.\"\nThe painting will be displayed at Sotheby's auction houses in Paris, Amsterdam and Hong Kong ahead of its sale on 25 March.\nSotheby's said: \"The appearance on the market of a work of this calibre, and from such an iconic series, is undoubtedly a major event.\"\nMontmartre was still semi-rural when the scene was painted. A windmill features prominently behind some perambulating locals. The famous Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur church that now dominates the area was under construction at the time.\nVan Gogh left Paris for the south of France in 1888. He died near Paris in July 1890.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "A pop star who was told she was \"not British enough\" to enter The Brits and the Mercury Prize has won a reversal in the awards' eligibility rules.\nRina Sawayama was told she could not compete for the prizes last year, because she was not a British citizen.\nThe singer, who has lived in the UK for 26 years, has now won the right to compete, after meeting award bosses.\nUnder new rules, artists who have been resident in the UK for more than five years qualify for the main prizes.\nSawayama holds indefinite leave to remain in the UK, but retains a Japanese passport to maintain ties with her family, including her father, who live in her country of birth.\nAs Japan does not allow dual citizenship, she cannot have a British passport. That led to her critically-acclaimed debut album, also called Sawayama, being ruled ineligible for last year's Mercury Prize.\n\"It was just heartbreaking,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I think a lot of immigrants feel this way -  where they assimilate and they become part of the British culture... and to be told that we're not even eligible to be nominated is very othering.\"\nSawayama first raised concerns about the situation in an interview with Vice last year.\n\"All I remember is living here,\" she said. \"I've just lived here all my life. I went to summer school in Japan, and that's literally it. But I feel like I've contributed to the UK in a way that I think is worthy of being celebrated, or at least being eligible to be celebrated.\"\nThe hashtag #SawayamaIsBritish trended in the UK shortly after her interview was published.\n\"Part of me that worried that I was... going to get blacklisted from the music industry for bringing this up,\" she told the BBC. \"But I'm glad I did.\"\nThe singer subsequently met with the BPI, which organises both the Brits and the Mercury Prize, and convinced them to review their criteria.\n\"I'm over the moon to share the news that, following a number of conversations, the BPI has decided to change the rules,\" Sawayama posted on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\"Starting this year, artists (like me) will be eligible for nomination even without British citizenship.\"\nThe Brit Awards confirmed the change to the BBC, saying it would apply to all its award categories, as well as the Mercury Prize.\nArtists will now have to meet one of three criteria to be eligible:\nThe change means Sawayama will be eligible for this year's Rising Star award, which recognises up-and-coming talent. \nHowever, she will not be able to compete in the main categories - including best British female and best album - as her record did not chart in the Top 40.\nSawayama has previously benefitted from funding from the BPI Music Export Growth Scheme, a grant that supports and celebrates British musicians, and her album is littered with references about growing up in London.\nThe record, which skilfully blends millennial pop and R&B with elements of nu-metal, was one of the best-reviewed new releases of 2020, with an average score of 89% on the review aggregation site Metacritic. \nMany publications, including the Guardian and the NME, named it among their best albums of the year; and it took 11th place in the BBC's \"poll of polls\", which combined the year-end lists from 35 influential newspapers, magazines and blogs.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A solicitor has said her phone has been \"ringing off the hook\" with companies asking if they can refuse to employ someone who has declined a Covid jab.\nThe UK justice secretary has said it may be legal for companies to insist new staff are vaccinated.\nElissa Thursfield, an employment lawyer at a practice in Denbighshire, said she expected to see employment tribunals over 'no jab, no job' policies.\nShe said employers needed to be able to justify any blanket policy. \nThe Welsh Government said it had no plans to change the law to make vaccinations compulsory.\n\"The phone has been ringing off the hook with people saying 'we're just worried - we lost residents, we lost staff members during this pandemic,\" said Ms Thursfield, who is head of employment at Gamlins Law in Rhyl.\nShe told BBC Radio Wales that employers are saying to her that insisting new staff have the jab \"seems like a really sensible way of controlling\" Covid and firms are asking \"please can we do this?\".\nMs Thursfield said with new staff it was \"likely to be a slightly more straightforward legal issue\" but with current staff it would be \"significantly more complex\".\n\"If you've got someone coming to work in a care home and they're a hands-on carer or a nurse they are going to be having significant close contact with clients at the care home - you can understand why the management would want people to be vaccinated,\" she said.\n\"However, if you've got somebody who works at home and has absolutely no day-to-day contact with other people, other than by virtual means, then 'no jab no job' will probably be seen to be unreasonable.\n\"What we're advising companies is make sure that you've looked at your risk assessments, you've decided the reasons why you want people to have the vaccine and how that's going to reduce the risk of Covid in your workplace, so making sure you can justify it before just putting a blanket policy out.\n\"There's a long process that employers are going to have to go through for existing employees, it's not going to be as simple as if you're not having it, you're out the door.\"\nThere have been more than 4.1 million confirmed cases and 121,000 deaths of people with coronavirus in the UK, while in Wales at least 7,000 people have died and more than 200,000 have tested positive for Covid.\nAbout 18 million people in the UK have had their first Covid jab with 869,500 of those in Wales. In Wales, nearly 50,000 have now been given the full course.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged all adults in the UK will be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\nMs Thursfield has warned that 'no jab, no job' policies will \"definitely\" lead to tribunals\n\"Where we think it's going to centre is on discrimination claims,\" she said.\n\"People who say because of their health, they can't have the immunisation, and if they've been refused a job because of it it's potentially indirect discrimination.\"\nUnions have warned firms it \"may be discriminatory\" and called on governments to make it clear that jabs should not be compulsory.\n\"The government should make clear that making a vaccination a condition of employment is definitely the wrong approach,\" said Shavanah Taj, General Secretary of trade union Wales TUC.\n\"It may be discriminatory, it could open up employers to legal and ethical challenges.\n\"Not everyone will be able to get vaccinated for a range of different reasons, including pregnant workers or people with disabilities, people with particular health conditions.\"\nBut the boss of a company that runs a number of care homes across the UK - including in Cardiff, Newport and Blaenau Gwent - said \"it would be a lot easier for me if everybody was vaccinated.\"\n\"The reality is though, should I be forcing people to have it?\" said Tony Stein, chief executive of Healthcare Management Solutions.\n\"I think if people aren't vaccinated amongst our workforce there's a very strong likelihood we'll be insisting on wearing PPE all the time being tested constantly.\"\nThe body that represents more than 450 care homes, nursing homes and social care providers in Wales says people in their profession \"really should have the jab unless there's a very good medical reason why not\".\n\"There is a suggestion\u2026 it might only be a small percentage but it's significant, of existing care workers who are refusing to have the jab,\" said Care Forum Wales chairman Mario Kreft.\n\"Then there's the other issues of people in the future, people coming into the sector.\n\"What Care Forum Wales is saying very clearly is that unless there's a very good medical reason why not, anyone in the future coming into the sector to care for vulnerable people, be it in their own homes or in care homes, they really should have the jab.\"\nThe Welsh Government has said the \"overwhelming majority of care home workers\" have had the Covid vaccine. \n\"Whilst we have no plans to change the law to make vaccinations compulsory,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We would urge every eligible adult to take-up the offer of the vaccine when it is their turn.\"\u00a0"

      "tags": "NI education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is a \"strong case\" for all pupils in Northern Ireland to return to classrooms by 8 March, Education Minister Peter Weir has said.\nHe said he believed health officials at Stormont had been \"over-cautious\" in recommending a phased return.\nOn Monday his party leader First Minister Arlene Foster had called for the executive to revisit its plan.\nMr Weir said he wanted to see \"movement across the board\" in getting pupils back into classrooms more quickly.\nSpeaking in the assembly, Health Minister Robin Swann says he is not aware of any advice around the phased re-opening of schools having changed.\nEarlier on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Mr Weir said he had advocated a full return in his paper to executive colleagues last week but that health advisers preferred a staged approach, with year groups going back at different times.\nThe executive is due to meet on Thursday to discuss its \"pathway-to-recovery\" blueprint.\n\"Anything that I put forward has been examined and predates what's happening in England,\" said Mr Weir.\n\"Obviously we want to look at what's happening in other jurisdictions but I've indicated that my preferred option was to see everyone returned to school on the 8 March.\n\"Indications certainly at that stage were given by some of the health advisers that they felt taking that full step was premature, which is why the executive at least moved forward on the initial steps.\n\"However well parents are providing that home-schooling, however well that work is being done also by schools, in terms of remote learning, it can't be a subsidiary for face-to-face teaching, it is effectively a second best.\n\"With some of the emerging evidence we've seen this week in Scotland... I think there is a strong case that we need to prioritise the education of our young people and get them back as soon as possible.\"\nMr Weir said quick movement was particularly needed on issues around primary schools.\n\"We've got the immediate return of P1 to P3 - I don't see why there can't be immediate movement for the rest of primary schools,\" he said.\n\"The damage that is being done, both from an educational point of view but from a wider societal point of view in terms of issues around mental health and the long term future of our young people are also critical.\n\"There's nowhere that's entirely risk free but I think [schools] represent a relatively safe place.\"\nThis latest Stormont split over schools feels all too familiar.\nOn Thursday the executive said it had agreed a phased approach, even though DUP ministers had been advocating a quicker return.\nBut just a few days later we are witnessing more friction over the issue within the executive.\nHow Stormont handles this developing row will indicate what might come down the track with managing wider plans to exit lockdown.\nRead more: Stormont school return split all too familiar\nMrs Foster has said she wants the Stormont executive to \"revisit\" its discussion about the reopening date for schools in Northern Ireland.\nShe was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his lockdown exit plan, with 8 March set for the return all schoolchildren in England.\n\"Unfortunately our health advisors didn't think that that was the right way forward,\" she said.\n\"I understand that we have to take a safe and sustainable way forward but I hope that we can now revisit that again because I know full well from my own experience the kitchen table is no substitute for a classroom.\"\nDeirdre O'Kane, the principal of St Patrick's and St Brigid's College in Claudy, County Londonderry, described Mr Weir's comments as \"confusing and frustrating\".\n\"Any change to announced plans for the return of school should be based on scientific evidence and the advice from health officials,\" she said.\nCollin Torrens, the principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, questioned why DUP ministers were pressing for a quicker return to the classroom for all pupils after the executive had agreed a plan last week.\n\"One minute it's not safe to go back and the next it is,\" he said.\n\"The sooner we get pupils back to school the better for everybody - that is what everyone wants - but only if it's safe.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in's education spokesperson Pat Sheehan said \"nothing has changed since last Thursday\".\n\"The [chief medical officer] told us last week that the reopening of schools completely would lead to a rise in the R number by between 0.3 and 0.7,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"If the R rate at the minute is sitting around 0.75 - even if we only hit that lowest number it brings us back above one and we're back in the exact same situation again.\n\"It's disappointing that Arlene wants to go and make policy on the hoof in interviews on the TV last night.\"The only thing that has changed is that Boris Johnson has decided to make a decision for England.\n\"You would think by now that the DUP would have learned not to hitch their wagon to Boris.\"\nThe SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said he was disappointed to see a \"rush to change\" the phased-return strategy for schools.\n\"We cannot risk the progress we have made against Covid-19 by rushing to act,\" he added.\nThere are no plans at present for school staff to be vaccinated in Northern Ireland, according to Mr Swann.\nResponding to a question from DUP MLA William Irwin, the health minister said they would not be looking at specific occupations but would continue to follow Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance which focuses on age and clinical profiles.\n\"I am aware piece of work JCVI looking at specific occupational cohorts that may be at more risk,\" he said.\n\"But as of yet we haven't received any further update and until I do receive further guidance I will be maintaining and sticking current guidance that we have to date because  it has worked for us so far in regards where we see decrease in the number infections in our care homes, infections in society but also the decrease in the number of hospitalisations that we are also seeing.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"impossible\" to give a date for the end of lockdown restrictions, one of Wales' top doctors says.\nDr Chris Jones, deputy chief medical officer, said there was a \"real risk\" of a third wave of Covid-19 cases if restrictions eased too quickly.\nHe was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a plan to end lockdown in England, by 21 June.\nThe Conservatives have called for the Welsh Government to produce a roadmap for the end of the Covid lockdown.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Jones said there were \"probably greater risks\" now than at previous points in the pandemic because of the more transmissible variants.\nHe told Claire Summers that opening schools \"has a definite effect on the R-rate\", and how the new variants will affect infections is \"uncertain\".\n\"It is absolutely impossible in my view to say that on any one date in several months, that this will be the situation,\" he said in response to a question about Mr Johnson's announcement.\n\"I think we have to take things step by step.\"\nHe said all the UK's chief medical officers \"share the same view about the risks associated with relaxing restrictions,\" but added politicians had \"very difficult decisions\" to make.\nBut he said \"messaging to the public\" was \"very important\".\n\"To send the message that everything is going to be back to normal in a few months time, I think, is almost too open,\" he said.\n\"We are not out of the woods yet. There is a real risk of a third wave if restrictions are eased too quickly.\n\"We hope, from our cautious approach and step-by-step approach, will minimise the risk of that.\"\nIn England, the prime minister has set out a four-stage plan beginning on 8 March, with \"at least\" five weeks between each of the stages to allow time to assess the impact of relaxing some restrictions to be felt, and prepare for the next stage if possible.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has published a \"cautious\" framework to ending restrictions there, with the reopening of shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers expected to start from 26 April.\nShe said it was hoped that Scotland's stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April.\nHowever, Northern Ireland has renewed lockdown measures until 1 April.\nChildren in England are due to return to the classroom on 8 March.\nIn Wales, Foundation phase children, aged three to seven, are returning to school this week.\nIf conditions regarding the virus continue to improve, all primary years will be back in school on 15 March, along with pupils in exam years 11 and 13, and some pupils in years 10 and 12 who are due to sit exams.\nHowever, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said not all of those secondary-age pupils would be back in full time, which she hopes will happen from 12 April.\nIn Scotland all primary pupils and S4 to S6 secondary students could return to school from 15 March, but pupils in the first three years of secondary school are unlikely to return until after Easter.\nFrom 8 March in England, one nominated person will be able to visit a care home resident, but there is no date for this in Wales, where care home visits remain banned. \nCare Forum Wales is working with the Welsh Government to \"formulate a safe policy for visiting\".\nSomeone who is very keen to see visits start is Jen Sutton.\nHer mother Liz Jones is 82 and lives in a care home in Aberystwyth. Ms Sutton, who lives in Cardiff, is an only child and used to visit her mother regularly until the pandemic struck.\n\"I haven't seen her indoors since March and the only other visit I've had is 20 minutes in a garden pod end of July, beginning of August. Then they closed down again for various reasons. I've seen her on Skype but it's not the same,\" she said.\n\"I'd just like to see her through a window. If it meant me isolating for 10 days beforehand I would do that. I don't particularly want to go in. I'm quite happy to wave through a window.\n\"It's a human right isn't it, to see your family. It's not too much to ask.\"\nThis is one of the areas where Wales could be moving more quickly than England.\nOn Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said some non-essential shops and hairdressers could reopen on 15 March.\nBut this has raised questions over prioritising this when large numbers of secondary pupils will remain unable to return to the classroom.\nEngland is due to reopen all shops on 12 April, while in Scotland the provisional date is 26 April.\nFor most of us the rules for who we can meet indoors remain limited to the people we live with.\nUntil 27 February, only those who lived alone - or are single and live in a house share - and single parents had been able to form a so-called \"support bubble\".\nHowever, now families with babies are now allowed to meet up with one other household to form a bubble.\nIt means anyone with a child under the age of one can form an exclusive support bubble with another household, allowing them to meet indoors, and stay overnight in each others homes.\nThe rule change also allows teenagers - aged 16 to 17 - who do not live with an adult to form a support bubble with another household.\nSince Saturday 20 February , people in Wales have been able to exercise in groups of four, but only from a maximum of two households, and it must be exercise rather than \"socialising\", Mr Drakeford said.\nIn England, from 8 March people can exercise with one other person not from their household, but they will also be allowed to meet outdoors on a park bench for a chat, for example, expressly for the purpose of socialising.\nIn Scotland a provisional date of 15 March has been given for four people from two households to be allowed to meet outdoors.\nThen from 29 March, people in England will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households, or two groups from two households. They will be able to do this in private gardens as well as public spaces.\nDiscussions have been ongoing in Wales with the tourism sector about a potential reopening at Easter.\nThe country is again likely to be ahead of England on this, although no firm date has been mentioned yet, and Mr Drakeford said it would not be opened \"in one go\".\nMr Johnson's roadmap has holidays in self-contained accommodation used by one household being allowed from 12 April at the earliest, which misses the school holidays completely.\nMr Drakeford has talked of easing the stay at home requirement at the lockdown review on 12 March, if cases continue to decreased.\nHowever he has said there could be a \"stay local\" requirement in place, as there was in the arrangements during the autumn for people to remain in their local authority area.\nMr Johnson has said the stay at home rule in England will end on 29 March but people should stay as local as possible, while in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April.\nAt present, only certain elite athletes in Wales are allowed to train together.\nNo dates have been mooted so far to allow people to get together for sport, including more individual distanced pursuits like golf or singles' tennis.\nThere are also no plans to reopen gyms.\nIn England, outdoor sports venues and formally organised outdoor sports can resume from 29 March. Gyms will be able to open from 12 April at the earliest.\nWhile in Scotland the possible date for reopening gyms and swimming pools has been mooted as 26 April.\nCurrently in Wales, only register offices and places of worship are open to perform marriages and guests are limited to the number who can be accommodated in the venue under the 2m social distancing regulations for different households.\nFrom 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen for ceremonies.\nIn England, six people can currently attend but ceremonies are limited to those in exceptional circumstances, such as those who are terminally ill.\nFrom 8 March, all weddings with six people will be allowed. This will expand to 15 people on 12 April and 30 people on 17 May.\nNot any time soon in Wales, in a nutshell. There has been no date mooted, and Mr Drakeford said closures were unlikely to be revoked in the next six weeks.\nIn England, it is hoped people will be able to visit outdoor seating in restaurants and pubs from 12 April, and move indoors from 17 May.\nMeanwhile in Scotland pubs could reopen on 26 April."

      "text": "Secondary schools in England will be asked to consider delivering face-to-face summer schools as part of efforts to help pupils catch up.\nAn extra \u00a3400m in funding has been announced, along with \u00a3300m announced for catch-up projects in January.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the money will help ensure \"no child is left behind\" due to the pandemic.\nTeachers, experts and unions called the money a \"good start\" - but warned about overwhelming pupils and teachers.\nThe prime minister has confirmed all pupils will return to classrooms from 8 March as part of the first step of a roadmap for easing England's lockdown. \nWith secondary school pupils being asked to take three Covid-19 tests in school when they come back, it is likely that secondary schools will have to stagger the return over a few days.\nAs part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year.\nThe government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said \"we're giving schools the option to be able to draw down on this funding\".\nHe said the average primary school will also receive around \u00a36,000 in extra money, with the average secondary school getting around \u00a322,000 extra in recovery premium payments.\nIt would be up to head teachers to decide how to use the money - it could be used, for example to pay teachers for overtime to do extra teaching.\nThe government's \u00a3700m education support package for England includes:\nLast year, Mr Johnson announced a \u00a31bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner.\nIn Scotland, the administration has promised \u00a3140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to \"help boost growth\" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nChief secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay, said communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would now all benefit from at least \u00a3800m of investment for town centre and high street regeneration, local transport, cultural and heritage projects. \nOn the subject of masks in schools, Mr Williamson said the policy of secondary pupils in England having to wear face coverings in classrooms would be reviewed over the Easter holiays. Most pupils will have to wear face coverings indoors, including in classrooms where social distancing isn't possible.\nHe did not rule out that the policy could remain in place until 21 June, which is the final date in plans to ease lockdown. \nThe government had considered a variety of options for pupils - including extended school days and shorter summer holidays - but neither of these proposals form part of the plan set out on Wednesday.\nAsked whether extending the school day could be among future measures, Mr Williamson told Sky News: \"We'll be looking at how we can boost and support children in a whole range of different manners.\n\"But it's not just about time in school it's about supporting teachers in terms of the quality of teaching and how we can help them.\"\nExams this year have already been cancelled in England, but Mr Williamson said more detail on how grades will be calculated is expected on Thursday. \nMother-of-three Emily Ellarby says her children are \"jaded\" by online learning and are ready to be back at school. But she says it would be \"hard to get them motivated\" for more school over the summer. \"They're looking forward to the summer holidays and having a proper break.\" \nShe says ultimately children just want to get back to school and normal life. \"They're quite keen to go back, they're looking forward to seeing their friends, they want that normality.\"\nFather-of-two Nick Lee says children and teachers need a proper summer break, not more schooling. \"My children have suffered enough with this pandemic and they will not attend any summer camps.\n\"We have all struggled to cope in these hard times, and stealing my children's summer is not the way to go.\"\nSarah Baker, who has two children and a stepchild, says she is \"torn\" over the idea of catch-up lessons in the summer.\n\"They're all at really critical stages in their education, but they're also at critical stages in their personal development. So, I'm completely torn. Yes, of course, they need to catch up, but they also need to regroup.\"\nAnd Sarah Webb, who has three children aged 11, eight and five, said children need time to recover from the past year, rather than more academic pressure.\n\"These children have missed out on social interaction and now need time to help readjust and come to terms with their experiences, not being given more time and pressure to bring them back up to academic standards that can simply no longer apply to them.\"\nKate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the new funding \"will not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost\".\n\"There is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing, which is fundamental to enabling their recovery from this pandemic,\" she said.\nLabour also calculated the new package was worth less than the \u00a3840m spent on the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last year, and would be worth 43p per pupil per day, if the money was split across a normal school year.\nSchool leaders' unions welcomed the funding but also warned of a long road ahead. \nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT - which represents head teachers - said summer schools \"will be of value for some pupils but it will be important not to overwhelm students\".\nChris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, said any provision needed to focus on children's \"physical wellbeing, and social and emotional development\", but he also expressed concern about teacher morale.\nHe said asking teachers, who were \"facilitating both in-class teaching and remote learning\", to work over the summer break was likely to \"exacerbate low morale\".\nBy Dan Johnson, BBC News \nJust working out how to measure what each child has missed during the pandemic is tricky, let alone agreeing on the best way to address it and make sure they all achieve their potential. \nMany teachers are wary of talking about \"catching-up\" and pupils being \"left behind\" - they do not want to discourage young people. \nBut there is widespread recognition that home learning could never fully replace classroom teaching and some pupils will need significant extra support when they get back to classrooms.\nThe government is backing one-to-one and small group tuition, alongside summer school activities. \nSuggestions of a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday have not materialised. \nMany teachers feel they can best assess what their pupils need, but after a relentless year, they are tired and need help in some form. \nHow that help is given and whether it reaches the right pupils will determine the lasting impact on the lives of children who've been through the most difficult school year."

      "text": "Wales' first officially-licenced beavers could arrive from Scotland within weeks.\nThe mammals were hunted to extinction across Britain in the 16th Century for their fur, meat and scent glands.\nHowever the Welsh Beaver Project is hopeful it will be granted a licence to keep as many as six in an enclosure.\nThe animals would be housed at Cors Dyfi Nature Reserve, near Machynlleth, Powys, where they would be used to clear willow trees.\nIt is hoped the semi-aquatic mammal could restore the three-hectare wetland habitat, boosting other species.\nAlicia Leow-Dyke, of the Welsh Beaver Project, said: \"Beavers coppice trees, they feed on the willow bark and barks of other trees.\n\"They will fell the trees to get the bark and eat the leaves. That will allow the area to open up and make it easier for people to manage in the future.\"\nThat should allow marshland vegetation to emerge - such as bog myrtle, rushes and reeds - which are low growing plants that like wetter areas.\nThe area has been difficult for people to clear because of the remains of conifer woodland that once grew there. \n\"The hope is that they will breed and form a small family group and manage the whole habitat over five years,\" Ms Leow-Dyke said.\n\"If they manage it enough, we can look to extend the enclosure.\"\nThe beavers could arrive anytime between March and May if the project, led by Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, is approved by Natural Resources Wales.\nBBC Springwatch presenter and naturalist, Iolo Williams, said it would be \"fantastic\" to have them back, adding: \"What you will find is that area, the bio-diversity will go through the roof.\n\"It will be brilliant for amphibians, aquatic plants, invertebrates and fish.\"\nHe said their dams would retain silt, leaving cleaner water for spawning salmon. \n\"People don't see the bigger picture of what's happening when you bring beavers back to an area where they have been absent for a number of years,\" he said.\nBeavers were reintroduced to Scotland in 2009 and now enjoy protected status there.\nTwo were also released into a Yorkshire forest last year to help stop flooding.\nA pair were introduced into an enclosure at Blaeneinion, a conservation project near Machynlleth, in 2008 - before licences were required - where their engineering has been credited with helping flood management.\nHowever fisheries expert Professor Ian Cowx, of University of Hull, in a report commissioned by the Angling Trust, said beavers could disrupt fish migration, cause shifts in fish species composition, damage river banks and reduce agricultural production.\nMark Owen, of the Angling Trust, said: \"We are very concerned about any impact on salmon, their habitats and their ability to reach spawning grounds, particularly as salmon are getting to be an endangered species. \n\"There needs to be careful consideration that we don't release one species that has the potential to impact on another that is so threatened.\"\nThe National Farmers' Union has raised concerns of the potential for flooding and farmers being powerless to act if beavers were to be granted protected status and escaped. \nGareth Wyn Jones farms along the River Dyfi near Llanwrin, about two miles from Machynlleth.\nHe questioned whether the beavers might damage the \"fragile\" ecological balance.\n\"It would be important to watch their development over time so people have an idea of the environmental impact,\" he said.\n\"One thing can make a big difference. We have a duty of care for the environment and the animal.\"\nNatural Resources Wales said it was still finalising its response to the application from Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust.\nThere is a separate application from North Wales Wildlife Trust to release 10 pairs into the River Dyfi as part of a five-year pilot study. \nNRW said it was awaiting further information for that application before launching a public consultation."

      "tags": "NI education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is a \"strong case\" for all pupils in Northern Ireland to return to classrooms by 8 March, Education Minister Peter Weir has said.\nHe said he believed health officials at Stormont had been \"over-cautious\" in recommending a phased return.\nOn Monday his party leader First Minister Arlene Foster had called for the executive to revisit its plan.\nMr Weir said he wanted to see \"movement across the board\" in getting pupils back into classrooms more quickly.\nSpeaking in the assembly, Health Minister Robin Swann says he is not aware of any advice around the phased re-opening of schools having changed.\nEarlier on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Mr Weir said he had advocated a full return in his paper to executive colleagues last week but that health advisers preferred a staged approach, with year groups going back at different times.\nThe executive is due to meet on Thursday to discuss its \"pathway-to-recovery\" blueprint.\n\"Anything that I put forward has been examined and predates what's happening in England,\" said Mr Weir.\n\"Obviously we want to look at what's happening in other jurisdictions but I've indicated that my preferred option was to see everyone returned to school on the 8 March.\n\"Indications certainly at that stage were given by some of the health advisers that they felt taking that full step was premature, which is why the executive at least moved forward on the initial steps.\n\"However well parents are providing that home-schooling, however well that work is being done also by schools, in terms of remote learning, it can't be a subsidiary for face-to-face teaching, it is effectively a second best.\n\"With some of the emerging evidence we've seen this week in Scotland... I think there is a strong case that we need to prioritise the education of our young people and get them back as soon as possible.\"\nMr Weir said quick movement was particularly needed on issues around primary schools.\n\"We've got the immediate return of P1 to P3 - I don't see why there can't be immediate movement for the rest of primary schools,\" he said.\n\"The damage that is being done, both from an educational point of view but from a wider societal point of view in terms of issues around mental health and the long term future of our young people are also critical.\n\"There's nowhere that's entirely risk free but I think [schools] represent a relatively safe place.\"\nThis latest Stormont split over schools feels all too familiar.\nOn Thursday the executive said it had agreed a phased approach, even though DUP ministers had been advocating a quicker return.\nBut just a few days later we are witnessing more friction over the issue within the executive.\nHow Stormont handles this developing row will indicate what might come down the track with managing wider plans to exit lockdown.\nRead more: Stormont school return split all too familiar\nMrs Foster has said she wants the Stormont executive to \"revisit\" its discussion about the reopening date for schools in Northern Ireland.\nShe was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his lockdown exit plan, with 8 March set for the return all schoolchildren in England.\n\"Unfortunately our health advisors didn't think that that was the right way forward,\" she said.\n\"I understand that we have to take a safe and sustainable way forward but I hope that we can now revisit that again because I know full well from my own experience the kitchen table is no substitute for a classroom.\"\nDeirdre O'Kane, the principal of St Patrick's and St Brigid's College in Claudy, County Londonderry, described Mr Weir's comments as \"confusing and frustrating\".\n\"Any change to announced plans for the return of school should be based on scientific evidence and the advice from health officials,\" she said.\nCollin Torrens, the principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, questioned why DUP ministers were pressing for a quicker return to the classroom for all pupils after the executive had agreed a plan last week.\n\"One minute it's not safe to go back and the next it is,\" he said.\n\"The sooner we get pupils back to school the better for everybody - that is what everyone wants - but only if it's safe.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in's education spokesperson Pat Sheehan said \"nothing has changed since last Thursday\".\n\"The [chief medical officer] told us last week that the reopening of schools completely would lead to a rise in the R number by between 0.3 and 0.7,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"If the R rate at the minute is sitting around 0.75 - even if we only hit that lowest number it brings us back above one and we're back in the exact same situation again.\n\"It's disappointing that Arlene wants to go and make policy on the hoof in interviews on the TV last night.\"The only thing that has changed is that Boris Johnson has decided to make a decision for England.\n\"You would think by now that the DUP would have learned not to hitch their wagon to Boris.\"\nThe SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said he was disappointed to see a \"rush to change\" the phased-return strategy for schools.\n\"We cannot risk the progress we have made against Covid-19 by rushing to act,\" he added.\nThere are no plans at present for school staff to be vaccinated in Northern Ireland, according to Mr Swann.\nResponding to a question from DUP MLA William Irwin, the health minister said they would not be looking at specific occupations but would continue to follow Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance which focuses on age and clinical profiles.\n\"I am aware piece of work JCVI looking at specific occupational cohorts that may be at more risk,\" he said.\n\"But as of yet we haven't received any further update and until I do receive further guidance I will be maintaining and sticking current guidance that we have to date because  it has worked for us so far in regards where we see decrease in the number infections in our care homes, infections in society but also the decrease in the number of hospitalisations that we are also seeing.\""

      "text": "With children in England back in the classroom, teachers face the massive task of making up for months of missed learning.\nA \u00a3720m package has been announced to help pupils in England catch up - although teachers' unions say more is needed. \nHere are some of the measures which could be used to help pupils.\nThe government has asked schools to consider offering face-to-face learning over the summer holidays this year.\nIt is to provide \u00a3200m to secondary schools to fund summer classes for pupils who need it most, especially those children moving up to Year 7.\nSummer schools with qualified teachers leading small groups can help children make up to four months of academic progress, according to the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). \nThey need a strong academic element, chief executive Becky Francis says, although sporting and other fun activities can also contribute to children's emotional wellbeing.\nShe adds: \"Staffing summer schools will be a challenge because of burnout among teachers.\"\nThe government's education catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, has said that the idea of summer schools has \"promise\".\nAnd Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was \"willing to discuss all possibilities\" for keeping schools open over the summer. \nHowever, evidence suggests that disadvantaged pupils, who would benefit the most, are less likely to take up the offer.\nTwo summer school trials run by the EEF saw less than 50% attendance among students in the target group.\nOne-to-one tuition is seen as a proven method of helping children catch up. \nWeekly sessions could help a student make three to six months of academic progress, with particularly large gains in literacy and numeracy among primary-school pupils, according to four recent UK studies.\nThe government is pledging money to an expanded National Tutoring Programme (NTP) for primary and secondary pupils, and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds. \nMore than 100,000 disadvantaged pupils have accessed the service since it began, in November.\nBut the NTP has largely offered online tuition since January, and many of the tutors are university students. \nProf Lee Elliott Major, from the University of Exeter, who first proposed the scheme, early last year, says: \"The evidence is thin about tutoring done online not by professionals.\n\"So the exact impact of the NTP is unclear at the moment.\"\nThe practice of retaking a whole year is common in some countries, such as Germany and the US, but rare in the UK.\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank has suggested it could help pupils whose education has fallen behind.\nBut the Association of School and College Leaders says the idea would be practical for a small number of students only.\nLarge-scale repetition would create \"a log-jam in the system\" and have huge knock-on effects on funding for universities.\nThe EEF estimates it would cost \u00a36,000 per pupil per year in England.\nAnd pupils who repeat a year make an average of four months' less academic progress than those at a similar level who continue on to the next school year, research suggests.\nDisadvantaged pupils can benefit from longer school days, US research suggests.\nAnd Robert Halfon, who chairs the Education Select Committee, told BBC News he had suggested the idea as \"a serious solution for the government to consider\" in England. \nThe extra teaching time could be provided by \"civil society instead of teachers\", he says. \nAfter-school clubs cost about \u00a37 a session, the EEF estimates.\nBut adding two extra weeks of school time a year would cost \u00a3260 per primary pupil and \u00a3360 per secondary pupil. \nThere have been calls for extra funding for mental health support for schoolchildren, to help ease their return to the classroom and improve their chances of catching up.\nTeaching staff trained to improve emotional wellbeing can help pupils make substantial attainment progress, EEF research suggests.\nAnd the EPI has proposed \u00a3650m of extra funding for additional school staff and in-school counselling programmes in England.\n\"Remedial wellbeing work will be necessary to achieve [academic] catch-up,\" it says, particularly for disadvantaged pupils."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nSecondary schools in England will be asked to deliver face-to-face summer schools to help some pupils catch up with lessons lost to Covid. It will be up to schools to decide which pupils get the lessons - they won't be for everyone, and the summer holidays won't be shorter. But the government is providing hundreds of millions of pounds in funding to make sure it happens. Alongside the face-to-face lessons for some secondary pupils, there is also funding for primary and secondary schools to boost summer clubs and activities. The prime minister said the money would ensure \"no child is left behind\". Schools in England closed to most pupils in March 2020. They reopened to some year groups in the summer term, and to all pupils in September. But they closed again in January, and are not due to reopen until 8 March. Watch our explainer below on the Covid risk to pupils.\nThe Republic of Ireland will keep its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions until at least 5 April. The widely expected decision to maintain Level Five was taken at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, but primary schools will reopen on Monday for younger pupils. The Irish vaccination programme is several weeks behind the UK's and has been hampered by supply issues, and the relatively late authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the European Medicines Agency.\nThe former lead singer of Showaddywaddy has advised people to get a vaccination after his \"brutal\" experience with Covid-19. Dave Bartram said he tested positive on 20 January, and \"for a month it has been debilitating\". He said: \"It bears no relation to flu whatsoever. It is the most brutal virus I have ever experienced.\"\nIn May 2019, Lynn Parker's husband of 42 years, Alastair, moved into a care home after he was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis. She visited him almost every day until March 2020, when the pandemic forced her to stop. He died just before Christmas in a Caerphilly nursing home - she had last held his hand 10 months earlier. Mrs Parker thinks at least one family member should be able to make care home visits in Wales. Watch her story here.\nOur education editor Branwen Jeffreys has visited a school in Shropshire to see how pupils and teachers are preparing for the reopening on 8 March. Measures will include voluntary Covid testing, and mask-wearing inside classrooms. \"There's not really much you can do,\" says one pupil who has already been wearing masks in class. \"You just have to try and get used to it.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nNo child's prospects should be \"blighted\" by the pandemic, the education secretary has said, as he set out funding for schools in England. At a Downing Street briefing, Gavin Williamson said \u00a3700m of funding would be available to schools to help pupils catch-up on missed learning. He also said teachers would be \"trusted\" when it came to assessments for students and that there would be \"no algorithms whatsoever\" used in determining exam grades in the summer. Details of how grades will be awarded will be set out on Thursday, Mr Williamson added. He also said the \"full return\" of schools and colleges from 8 March is justified by scientific advice, which will be supported by a \"robust\" testing regime. \nEveryone on the GP learning disability register should be prioritised for a Covid vaccine, the joint committee on vaccination has advised the government. This means 150,000 people at higher risk with severe disabilities will be offered a jab more quickly in England. But those with mild learning disabilities should not expect to be prioritised. It follows DJ Jo Whiley's plea for people such as her sister, Frances, to be vaccinated as quickly as possible. The BBC Radio 2 presenter was offered the vaccine before her sister, who has a rare genetic syndrome and lives in residential care.\nGhana has become the first country to receive coronavirus vaccines through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. The World Health Organization (WHO) programme aims to ensure that vaccines are shared fairly among all nations. Covax is aiming to deliver about two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines globally by the end of the year. Many rich nations, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need (shown in the graphic below). So what is the Covax scheme? And how long will people in Africa have to wait?\nHairdressers and nail salons are set to reopen from 12 April, along with many other retailers. But a long period of closure means they, like many businesses, have been racking up debts due to Covid restrictions. Hellen Ward, co-founder of beauty salon chain Richard Ward, says her debts have reached \u00a31,000 a day while her salons have been closed. She is part of a campaign calling on the government to cut VAT to help mend the hair and beauty sector's finances. A survey of salon owners suggests that 56% are considering closing.\nReading and Leeds Festival organisers appear to have confirmed the events will go ahead this summer, after plans to ease lockdown were announced. Under the government's plan, limits on social contact in England could be gone by 21 June, if Covid is under control. The twin-site festival is due to take place from 27 to 29 August. \"Following the government's recent announcement, we can't wait to get back to the fields this summer,\" Reading and Leeds' Twitter feed said, adding: \"Let's go!\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

Then on March 20th 2020 all visiting stopped.\n\"When I was allowed to see him again it was outside and two metres away, or through a glass door, and would stop if someone in the home was poorly.\n\"All these months when he needed me I could see he was fading from me. I was his lifeline. \n\"It was almost a form of cruelty.\"\nMrs Parker said her husband - a retired police sergeant - started to refuse food, drink and medicine. She would try to coax him to eat and drink via Skype, but \"it wasn't the same\". \n\"He thought he was abandoned, I promised him I was doing everything I could to get in and he was saying, just break the glass,\" she said. \n\"Alastair was cocooned in there and didn't realise the desperate situation outside, he would look at me as if 'here we go' when I tried to explain why I couldn't see him.\n\"I was staying at home to keep myself well, so when I could have gone in, I could go in with a clear conscience, but that time never came. I tried everything I could.\n\"I would have put on everything, any form of PPE, I would have worn it, to let me get in there.\"\nShe spoke to him on the morning of 19 December on the phone. \nBut, an hour later she had a call to say he had died.\nShe said: \"I really believe he died of a broken heart. His capacity was fading by the week, after 42 years of married life I needed to be there with him, he just missed all of that.\n\"I think Alastair's contributing factor of his death was he was heartbroken, I could tell I was losing him. \n\"To go months and months without holding his lovely hand until he was dead.\n\"It makes me angry now.\"\nMrs Parker said she wanted the Welsh Government to change the rules so other families did not experience what she had, with one nominated family member allowed to visit.\nShe said: \"I honestly would want the government to consider one member of the family to be classed as a key worker.\n\"Wear whatever they have to wear, but at least it would give the resident and the family member some hope for the future.\"\nIt was announced last weekend that care home residents in England will be allowed one regular visitor from 8 March.\nThey will be able to meet indoors and hold hands - but visitors must wear PPE and be tested beforehand.\nIn Scotland indoor visits will start again in early March.\nThere has been no announcement about a change in the rules in Wales yet.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We recognise the importance of people in care homes being able to meet their family and loved ones and we are considering how to allow more indoor visits given the success of our vaccine rollout to care home residents and workers.\n\"In the meantime, while we are at alert level four, indoor visits should only take place in exceptional circumstances. These include - but are not limited to - end of life. \n\"This has been the case throughout the pandemic period. Care homes are asked to consider such requests sensitively and on an individual basis. At alert level four, outdoor visits and visits in a visitor pod can take place after a risk assessment has taken place.\""

      "text": "A passer-by saved a man's life by administering CPR on him for five minutes after he had a cardiac arrest and collapsed. \nThis kept blood flowing around 55-year-old Bobby Gamlin's body until paramedics arrived - but his family were still told to expect the worst. \nHowever, after two weeks in intensive care, Mr Gamlin, from Roath, Cardiff, is set to be moved to a cardiac ward.\nHis family want to find the man who helped to thank him.\nMr Gamlin's sister Mary Taylor believes he is the reason \"my brother is still here\" and her appeal to find him has been shared more than 700 times on Facebook.\n\"He (Bobby) had died. And wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him keeping the blood around his body until the ambulance arrived,\" she said.\n\"They took him to the Heath (University Hospital of Wales), and it took them an hour to get him back (breathing). \n\"But that man showed so much bravery, definitely in these unprecedented times with Covid, to go straight to a stranger, to be that brave. There are no words.\"\nFather-of-one and grandfather-of-two Mr Gamlin had been shopping on Albany Road in Roath with a friend on 11 February when he started feeling dizzy. \nBut as he went to sit down on benches, he collapsed into the plant pots, Mrs Taylor said. \n\"His friend panicked, but a man passing with his girlfriend said 'I know CPR, do you mind?' and pulled him onto the floor as someone else called an ambulance,\" she added.\n\"It's so easy to not know what to do, so I dread what to think would have happened if he wasn't there.\"\nThe ambulance arrived in about five minutes - but Mr Gamlin had stopped breathing and the man battled alone to keep blood circulating around his body until paramedics could take over.\nEven so, after being taken to the city's University Hospital of Wales, it took doctors an hour to get him breathing, with his family told by doctors to expect the worst.\nMrs Taylor said relatives, who were unable to visit because of Covid restrictions, were informed Mr Gamlin could be left with brain damage or may not even make it, as he was treated in intensive care.\n\"He has confounded everyone, they didn't expect him to live,\" Mrs Taylor added.\n\"He will probably need surgery but compared to before, he is now sat in a chair and could eat a meal and drink himself yesterday - he was fed by a tube before.\n\"He is also able to send messages on his phone now.\"\nMr Gamlin is set to leave intensive care for a cardiac ward on Thursday, and Mrs Taylor wants to find the man, in his 20s, who saved him, saying \"we owe him everything\".\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service did not comment on the specific case but said \"time is always of the essence\" when dealing with cardiac arrests and urged everyone to learn \"these life-saving skills\".\nRobert Brunnock, manager for Cardiff, said: \"When it comes to cardiac arrests, time is always of the essence. \n\"As an emergency service, our utmost priority will always be to arrive at the scene of an incident as quickly as possible. \n\"However, the earlier CPR is performed on a patient suffering from cardiac arrest, the better.\""

      "tags": "Germany,Syrian civil war,Bashar al-Assad,Syria",
      "text": "A German court has sentenced a former Syrian intelligence officer to four-and-a-half years in jail for complicity in crimes against humanity.\nProsecutors in Koblenz successfully argued that Eyad al-Gharib, 44, had helped to arrest protesters in 2011 who were later tortured and murdered. \nThe case was unprecedented for its hours of witness testimony describing widespread torture in Syria.\nAnother Syrian - Anwar Raslan, 58 - remains on trial. \nBoth fled Syria's civil war and got asylum in Germany - but were arrested in 2019.\nGerman prosecutors invoked the principle of \"universal jurisdiction\" for serious crimes to bring the case.\nThe agency the men worked for played a crucial role in suppressing the peaceful pro-democracy protests that erupted against President Assad's regime in 2011.\nProsecutors argued that the two men were \"cogs in the wheel\" enabling a vast state torture machine to operate. \nEyad al-Gharib was charged with bringing at least 30 protesters to a notorious Damascus prison to be tortured in 2011, while working for Syria's most powerful civilian intelligence agency, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID). \nHis defence lawyers argued that he feared punishment for disobedience if he did not carry out orders, and highlighted his willing co-operation with German authorities and assistance in providing evidence against Anwar Raslan. \nAl-Gharib says he defected from Mr Assad's regime to help the opposition and then fled Syria in 2013, arriving in Germany in 2018.\nEyad al-Gharib was a relatively low-level operative among thousands of others in the Syrian regime's highly developed network of coercion and repression.\nThe verdict is a legal landmark. The prosecution was intended as a test case, to build up a body of evidence about the actions of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad that could be used in other trials, not just in Germany.\nAl-Gharib's conviction starts to chip away at any sense of impunity felt by Syrians still working for the regime who might be involved with war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nThe German human rights lawyers behind the case have spent years using the principle of universal jurisdiction to reach out across borders to pursue other allegations. Their targets have included the former US President George W Bush for crimes including violations of the UN Convention against Torture.\nAnwar Raslan is suspected of being involved in the torture of at least 4,000 people in 2011-12. He is charged with 58 counts of murder as well as rape and sexual assault.\nHe is accused of being a high-ranking officer in charge of the GID's al-Khatib prison in Damascus, known as \"Hell On Earth\". If convicted, he faces life in prison.\nFor some Syrians the trial, which began in April 2020, was a rare chance for justice after countless atrocities. \n\"This trial represents the first step towards justice that the Syrian victims have truly felt,\" rights lawyer Anwar al-Bunni told the BBC from Germany, where he sought asylum. \nMr Bunni says he was arrested by Anwar Raslan in Damascus and was shocked later to come face to face with him in a Berlin shop. He assisted prosecutors in preparing the case.\n\"Although this trial is centred on two defendants... it targets the infernal machine of torture and murder [of President Assad's regime],\" he said.\nHours of witness testimony laid bare the mechanics of the Syrian regime's alleged brutalities. Prosecutors described killing and torture on an \"almost industrial scale\", according to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.\nIn court, witnesses described being beaten and kicked on arrival at the Damascus prison. They spoke of being raped and hung from the ceiling for hours, how torturers tore their fingernails out and gave them electric shocks, then doused them with water.\nThe evidence included thousands of images leaked by a military defector known as Caesar.\nMr Assad's authoritarian government has repeatedly denied accusations of torturing and forcibly disappearing hundreds of thousands of people.\nGermany is investigating dozens of former Syrian officials accused of atrocities.\nLong before the war began, President Assad and his father Hafez before him were accused of torture, rampant corruption and the near-total crushing of opposition.\nBut when uprisings hit regimes across the Arab world in 2011, many Syrians decided they wanted democratic change too.\nThousands took to the streets and several military generals defected to join the protests. The government responded with crushing force, ordering soldiers to shoot at and arrest demonstrators.\nThe battle between protesters and Mr Assad's forces escalated into armed conflict. It was further complicated when violent jihadist groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) infiltrated the once-peaceful protest movement.\nA decade on, more than 387,000 people are dead, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The toll does not include 88,000 civilians that the group believes to have died of torture in government-run prisons.\nPresident Assad now controls the major cities, but armed opposition groups hold various enclaves.\nIn a separate development on Wednesday, an Iraqi man accused of being IS's top recruiter in Germany was sentenced to ten-and-a-half years in prison. \nAfter a trial lasting three years, a court in the northern city of Celle found Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah Abdullah, 37, guilty of supporting and belonging to the designated terrorist group. Better known as Abu Walaa, he was imam at a mosque in nearby Hildesheim which has since been closed. \nProsecutors said he and three other defendants sent mainly teenage recruits to fight in Syria and Iraq."

      "tags": "Care homes,NHS,Netley,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Despite the huge need to free up space in hospitals, some care homes say insurance issues make it impossible for them to accept Covid-19 patients.\nIn October, the government launched a scheme for designated care homes to take patients recovering from the virus but insurance is a stumbling block.\nSir David Behan, head of the UK's largest care home company, HC-One, says insurance has become a major concern.\nThe government says it is working to resolve the issue. \n\"We are aware the adult social care insurance market is changing in response to the pandemic, and recognise some care providers may encounter difficulties as their policies come up for renewal,\" said a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson. \nOne Hampshire care home says it will have to stop taking patients within days because its insurance will expire.  \nWaterside House in Netley, Hampshire usually provides holidays and respite care for people with disabilities. \nBut since the autumn it has been taking Covid-positive patients discharged from hospitals on the south coast. \nThey are looked after on a separate floor from other residents, and the home has had to meet high infection control standards. \nHome manager Sarah Knight said demand for the 31 beds is unparalleled and added: \"I've been in nursing a long, long time, and I have never known anything like this. \n\"People end up in an ambulance sat outside hospitals for hours and hours, or they end up on a trolley in A&E in a corridor for hours and hours. \n\"By offering the best that we've got here, we can reduce some of that burden.\"\nThe government originally hoped there would be 500 designated care homes taking in Covid-positive patients. \nBut Waterside House is one of only 129 which have been set up to take those who have not completed 14 days in isolation. \nHowever, its public indemnity insurance protection, which it needs in case someone contracts Covid there, runs out at the end of January. \nWaterside House is run by the charity Revitalise, whose chief executive, Jan Tregelles, said they have tried everything, but will soon have to start turning away people. \n\"It's shocking,\" she says. \"We are truly helpless. We have a fantastic team of nurses and colleagues already. \n\"The facilities are here, everything's arranged and we can't step up to support our communities at this time.\"\nOne resident, Alan Washbourne, who has been living at Waterside House since he was discharged from hospital during the first wave of the pandemic, said: \"I feel quite safe here.\" \nHe is not on the Covid floor of the home, and added: \"If I were to go to somewhere else, which is possible, I might not feel quite so safe.\"\nAfter so many deaths last spring, many care homes  will not consider taking patients who are Covid-positive, even with extra infection control measures. \nMeanwhile, growing numbers of staff are off sick or self-isolating, leaving care homes facing shortages. \nAnd many are also finding it difficult to get the public indemnity insurance. \nSince November, HC-One, which is the UK's largest care home provider, has had to cover its own Covid risks because it cannot get the insurance.  \nSir David said it is one of the reasons why they have not taken part in the designated places scheme.  \n\"You've got solicitors' firms advertising, taking cases up against care companies,\" he says. \n\"So, this isn't a theoretical risk that there may be proceedings, it's an actual risk, and therefore we need cover.\n\"The NHS wouldn't operate without similar liability cover and that's what we need to see, and I think governments have a role to play working with the insurance industry to work to find a solution.\" \nThe Department for Health and Social Care said it was making efforts to determine what actions it could take.\n\"Our priority is to ensure everyone receives the right care, in the right place, at the right time,\" said a spokesperson.

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Heathrow Airport expansion,London Heathrow Airport,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Heathrow Airport has reported a \u00a32bn annual loss after passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s.\nIt said 2020 was the toughest year in its 75-year history and the loss \"underlines the devastating impact of Covid-19 on aviation\".\nHeathrow's results contained a warning it may not be able to carry on if passenger numbers remain low.\nHowever, its boss said the airport had enough money to cope until 2023.\nJohn Holland-Kaye also told the BBC that he thought people would be likely to be able to go on their summer holidays.\nUnder the UK government's roadmap out of lockdown, which was published on Monday, international travel might be able to resume in mid-May.\n\"For the aviation sector, we can start to plan ahead for 17 May to make sure we've got the people and the planes in place so that we can get, not just people on their holidays, but also start to get British businesses moving again,\" he said.\nMr Holland-Kaye said it was likely that travel to the UK from \"low-risk\" countries such as New Zealand and Singapore would not require a Covid test, \"medium-risk\" countries where passengers would need a test, and \"high risk\" countries would require tougher passenger controls such as quarantining.\nThe UK is in discussions with G7 countries and others as to how to allow greater foreign travel, with talks underway with some countries about a potential passport scheme.\nMr Holland-Kaye said that a digital vaccine passport and international agreements would be needed to speed up travel at airports.\nCurrently it takes about 20 minutes per passenger at Heathrow to sort out the necessary paperwork, which will not be feasible when passenger numbers pick up, he said.\nHave you recently booked a holiday? Get in touch.\nLockdowns and travel restrictions imposed in 2020 to try to limit the global spread of coronavirus hit the aviation sector hard.\nHeathrow normally has about 80 million passengers per year, but it said numbers in 2020 dropped to 22 million, with more than half of those travelling in January and February before the coronavirus crisis took hold.\nIn the long-term, if passenger numbers were to drop below 27 million, Heathrow would be in danger of breaching deals it has with creditors, it said.\nIn January, the government opened a financial support scheme for airports in England, which included \u00a38m per applicant to be used to cover fixed costs such as business rates.\nOn Wednesday, Heathrow called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next week's Budget to extend the furlough scheme and give a 100% business rates holiday to give additional support to the aviation sector.\nHeathrow doesn't have many passengers at the moment, but one thing it does have a lot of is borrowing.\nThe London airport has built a \u00a315bn debt pile in the past decade while paying its shareholders several billion pounds in dividends.\nThe collapse in traffic caused by the coronavirus pandemic has understandably put a strain on its finances, to the extent that the company has asked the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), its economic regulator, for an increase in prices to compensate.\nThe request has outraged its airline customers, who say they and their passengers should not have to pick up the airport's pandemic tab.\nThere is no danger of Heathrow running out of money in the short term - it has about \u00a34bn in cash, enough to keep it ticking over for two years - but the accounts do include a warning about the future.\nThe directors say that the uncertainty about the timescale and nature of the recovery from the pandemic \"indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which could cast significant doubt upon the group and the company's ability to continue as a going concern\".\nIt would take a serious prolongation of traffic restrictions for Heathrow's current financial structure to crack - but the warning underlines why the company is pressing the CAA so hard for a price increase. \nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) has also pleaded with governments to continue their financial support for the aviation sector.\nThe industry body warned on Wednesday that airlines could continue to burn cash into 2022 amid uncertainty around when restrictions will ease. It estimated that aviation firms burnt through $77bn (\u00a354.6bn) in cash during the second half of 2020 alone.\nIts boss Alexandre de Juniac told the BBC: \"The crisis is not over. \n\"If you want us to be alive when the restart will come, when the traffic will recover, which is not before the second half of 2021... We need support with additional financial help.\"\nIt is currently working on a \"Covid travel pass\", an app which could be used to verify if a passenger has had the Covid-19 tests or vaccines required to enter a country.\nThe director general said in a BBC interview on Wednesday that it is talking to the UK government about using its app. \nHe played down concerns about the security of any app-based system: \"It's pretty well done and designed for that purpose\". \nMr de Juniac said the focus was on passengers controlling their data and that \"there is no information that is stored in any database that the government control or IATA control at all.\""

      "text": "Reading and Leeds Festival organisers say they are \"very confident\" the events will go ahead this summer, after plans to ease lockdown were announced.\nUnder the government's plan, limits on social contact in England could be gone by 21 June, if Covid is under control.\nThe twin-site festival is due to take place from 27 to 29 August.\n\"The good news is that we can be very confident that Reading and Leeds is going to take place,\" festival boss Melvin Benn told BBC Radio 1.\nAsked how the event could go ahead when others like Glastonbury had been forced to cancel, he told Radio 1's Newsbeat: \"In fairness, we haven't done it, the government have done it. The government are vaccinating everybody and that's how it's going to happen.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, Reading and Leeds' Twitter feed posted a message saying: \"Following the government's recent announcement, we can't wait to get back to the fields this summer. Let's go!\"\nStormzy, Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age have already been announced as headliners, with Mabel, AJ Tracey and Doja Cat also on the line-up.\n\"The acts are desperate to play, the kids are desperate to come,\" said Benn. \"I can feel that.\"\nThe promoter told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he believed all adults would be offered a second vaccine by mid-August - two or three weeks before Reading and Leeds.\n\"The one thing that we can say about the prime minister is that, in terms of the vaccination roll-out, almost uniquely in the world, he has got it right,\" Benn said.\n\"I applaud him for that, and I am going to hold his feet to the fire on it. And I think there's going to be 200,000 young people holding his feet to the fire on that position as well.\"\nSuffolk's Latitude festival, which is also run by Benn's company Festival Republic, is expected to make an announcement about its plans for 2021 in the near future,  he added.\nLast year, he told MPs his events could not go ahead while social distancing was in place. However, he said live music could resume with mass testing of fans. It is unclear what measures will be in place this summer.\nReading and Leeds is regarded by many fans as second only to Glastonbury in the annual UK music calendar. Originally a rock festival, it has seen legendary performances by Nirvana, Oasis, Guns N' Roses and Paramore.\nMore recently, it has embraced dance and hip-hop, with high-profile slots for The Prodigy, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone. This year, the festival is due to host about 200,000 fans at Richfield Avenue in Reading and Bramham Park in Leeds, with two main stages at each site.\nThe festival's bullish announcement comes less than 48 hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his four-step plan for easing restrictions.\nUnder the proposals, outdoor hospitality, including drive-in cinemas, could re-open as part of step two in April. Pilots of indoor live events, with social distancing, could also commence at the same time. \nStep three, which would start no earlier that 17 May, could allow limited indoor mixing. Indoor concerts would have a limit of 1,000 people or 50% of a venue's maximum capacity. Outdoor concerts and sporting events would have an upper limit of 4,000 people - or 10,000 for seated events.\nThe roadmap gives no guarantee for those dates, with every step dependent on slowing the spread of Covid-19.\nBenn said he thought it was unlikely the timetable would change. \"Why would it?\" he asked, adding that \"we have to, at some point, start planning for life to go back\" to normal.\nDr Google, manager of rap act Bad Boy Chiller Crew, who are due to play Reading and Leeds, added: \"Obviously anything can get cancelled but... I don't think the music industry could last another 12 months without any live events\".\nThe industry has largely welcomed the timeline for the lifting of lockdown restrictions in England. However, it warned that live music was \"at the back of the queue to re-open\" and may still need financial assistance.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Omicron variant,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "The ambulance service warned a year before the Manchester Arena bombing that lives would be lost if specialist medical help was delayed during a terror attack, an inquiry heard. \nIt took more than two hours to deploy triage teams in a 2016 terror training exercise, a public inquiry was told.\nRetired Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Inspector June Roby said lessons should have been learned. \nOne paramedic was at the scene in the first 40 minutes after the 2017 bomb.  \nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.\nThe inquiry was told that, during the counter-terror training exercise at the Trafford Centre in May 2016, there was a two-hour delay in treating casualties because of serious command and communication problems with the police. \nA debrief by the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) after the drill said there was a \"huge delay in deployment\u2026\u2026this would have unequivocally resulted in unnecessary loss of life.\"\nRetired inspector June Roby, who was responsible for devising part of the exercise, said she was not aware at the time \"that there was such a big delay\" but she agreed \"entirely\" with the NWAS statement.\nPete Weatherby QC, representing some of the bereaved families, asked Ms Roby, if the Winchester Accord went \"catastrophically wrong in terms of the multi-agency response\".  \nShe replied, \"It would appear so, yes.\" \nMs Roby said that, while she was not responsible for how the force responded on the night of the bombing, she  accepted that lessons should have been learned.\n\"It's a real concern that [fire and ambulance services] weren't contacted when they should have been,\" she said.\nBefore 2017, there were widespread concerns that the Force Duty Officer (FDO), who co-ordinates the initial emergency response to an attack, could be a \"major point of failure\".  \nMs Roby said she was aware that a better plan was needed but sorting it out was \"way above my pay grade\". \nThe hearing has previously been told that the FDO on the night of the arena bombing quickly became overwhelmed. \nAmid erroneous reports of gunfire and an active shooter on the loose he declared Operation Plato, the police response to a marauding terrorist firearms attack.\nBut he failed to inform the fire service and ambulance service, who could not contact him as his telephone line was swamped, the hearing heard.\nFire crews with specialist equipment and training were kept away from the City Room, the first fire engine arrived on scene more than two hours later and only one paramedic was at the City Room in the first 40 minutes after the blast.\nThe Chair of the Inquiry, Sir John Saunders asked Ms Roby if the FDO role was ever fully tested. \nShe said, \"Not to its fullest extent, no.\"\nJohn Cooper QC, who also represents some of the victims' families, asked Ms Roby if the planning policies were \"inadequate\".\nMs Roby said: \"I disagree\u2026.I started every single exercise with 'this is not a case of if this happens, for me it's a case of when this happens. \n\"There is so much going on in the world that Greater Manchester cannot remain in this little bubble where nothing happens. We are going to get something at some point.'\"\nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Elon Musk,Bitcoin,Tesla",
      "text": "Tesla boss Elon Musk has lost his title as the world's richest person after a recent slide in the electric carmaker's shares, the main driver of his wealth.\nTesla shares have tumbled more than 20% since hitting a high of more than $880 in early January.\nThey suffered especially steep falls this week, tied to the firm's recent risky $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) investment in Bitcoin.\nThe drop returned Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to the top spot on the rich list.\nThe risk of being associated with the notoriously volatile Bitcoin - which has fallen sharply in recent days - may have prompted some Tesla investors to sell their shares, even if the firm has not been hurt by the declines, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.\n\"By Musk and Tesla aggressively embracing Bitcoin... investors are starting to tie Bitcoin and Tesla at the hip,\" he said.  \n\"The recent 48-hour sell-off in Bitcoin and added volatility has driven some investors to the exits on this name in the near-term.\" \nBitcoin's value jumped nearly 50% in the weeks after Tesla revealed it had purchased $1.5bn of the currency and planned to accept it as payment. \nBut since climbing above $57,000 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency has dropped nearly 20%. It was trading at less than $48,000 on Tuesday - still higher than when Tesla disclosed its bet.\nJust as Mr Musk was credited with helping to fuel Bitcoin's rise, he may also have himself to blame for some of the recent Bitcoin declines. \nIn an exchange on Twitter over the weekend Mr Musk wrote that the price of Bitcoin did \"seem high lol\".\nAlso driving the cryptocurrency lower were comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who sounded a warning on Bitcoin on Monday. She called it an \"extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions\".\nThe comments follow a recent surge of interest in Bitcoin, after major US firms such as Mastercard and Bank of NY Mellon followed Tesla's lead in announcing plans to incorporate the digital currency into their operations.\nMr Musk's attention to Bitcoin comes as Tesla faces other challenges. \nThe firm recently halted most sales of the lowest-priced version of its Model Y SUV, with Mr Musk citing a desire to improve the car's range.\nEarlier this month, Chinese regulators summoned the firm over safety and quality issues, after reports of battery fires and abnormal acceleration.\nRival carmakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen have also stepped up their focus on electric vehicles in recent months.\nThe struggles follow an astonishing rise in Tesla shares in 2020, when prices leapt from less than $90 to more than $700.\nThe increase propelled Mr Musk past Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in the world's richest rankings for the first time in January, while also raising questions about whether that value made sense for a firm that produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals. \nThe two billionaires have been vying for the top spot in the weeks since. \nThe more than 8% decline in Tesla's share price on Monday was the biggest since September and wiped more than $15bn off Mr Musk's net worth, according to Bloomberg. Shares fell a further 2% on Tuesday.\nMr Musk's tweets have also famously triggered sharp moves in Tesla shares, including last year when the firm lost $14bn in market value after he wrote that its share price was too high."

      "title": "Covid: Why can't we unlock more quickly?",
      "tags": "Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The vaccine rollout is going well and cases have plummeted since lockdown began at the start of the year.\nAnd yet the road out of lockdown in England and elsewhere in the UK is slow and gradual.\nMinisters say they want to closely monitor the impact of each step before moving on to the next one. It is a process which will take four months at least.\nWhy is the government being so cautious?\nA key mantra in the lead up to the announcement is that each step forward must be irreversible. There must be no steps back. \nBut despite falling infection rates, the number of new daily cases still remains relatively high compared to summer and early autumn. It is still a very delicate position.\nPlus ministers have certainly been stung by the problems of last year, when the first unlocking saw areas in the North West and Midlands having restrictions quickly re-imposed.\nThen, during the autumn, some areas found themselves constantly moving up and down the tiers.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant such chopping and changing cannot happen again. \"What we want to see is progress that is cautious, but irreversible.\"\nThe government has achieved its target of offering everyone over the age of 70 a jab by mid-February.\nIt means by the time schools open, the most vulnerable people in society should have built up a fair degree of immunity. But that still leaves significant numbers at risk.\nNearly half of those admitted to hospital with Covid are under 70. \nAnd with the numbers in hospital only just below the level they were at during the peak in the first wave, the NHS is not yet out of the woods.\nSchools are not considered a significant driver of infection. Cases still fell in November when England was in lockdown but schools remained open.\nBut there is still a concern re-opening them for all pupils could push up the rates. One of the big unknowns is the new more contagious variant which was not dominant back in November.\nResearch by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has predicted re-opening schools for all could push the R number - the average number of people an infected individual passes the virus on to - above one, prompting a growth in cases.\nThe break at Easter will provide an opportunity to assess the impact of the move - and is why ministers resisted calls to only send some year groups back.\nMutations are to be expected. Growing levels of immunity from further rollout of the vaccine will favour variants that can sneak past the vaccine.\nThat is because of what is known as selection advantage. Viruses change all the time, and the mutations that have an advantage will spread more easily.\nIn the future, when the population has a lot of immunity, mutations that can evade some of the immune response will be in a stronger position to spread.\nThat does not mean the mutations will render the vaccines completely ineffective - coronaviruses are more stable than flu, with which we see different strains circulating each year.\nBut experts have warned everything must be done to guard against mutation at such a delicate time.\nVaccinating when there is a lot of virus circulating is pretty unusual. Normally vaccines are given ahead of exposure.\nScientists believe having high levels of infection at a time when people are building up immunity will encourage mutations even more than normal. That, they warn, would be foolish.\nModelling carried out for the government by Imperial College London has looked at what would happen if there was a quick unlocking.\nIt suggested if restrictions were lifted by the end of April, there could be a surge in deaths in the coming months.\nAnd by next summer another 80,000 Covid fatalities could be seen.\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, says: \"The sooner you open up everything, the greater the risk of a resurgence. The slower the better.\"\nBut such modelling is by its very nature full of uncertainty, because of the assumptions that have to be made.\nFor example, this modelling has not taken into account seasonality.\nWould there really be a surge in the summer when people are outdoors and respiratory viruses tend not to thrive? \nIt is a risk ministers are simply not prepared to take. \nIn taking this approach, though, it is quite conceivable the government could quickly find itself under pressure.\nThe restrictions will continue to have a huge impact on people's lives and livelihoods for months to come.\nIf re-opening schools does not prompt a rise in cases, if the warmer weather helps and the vaccine impact really begins to kick in, infections and hospital admissions could fall to very low levels.\nA key phrase used in the lead up to the roadmap being unveiled was the importance of \"data not dates\".\nThat works both ways.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Colwyn Bay,Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new Welsh Government plans.\nA vaccine strategy unveiled by Health Minister Vaughan Gething aims to offer all adults a jab by the autumn.\nIt comes after criticism that the rollout of the vaccine has been slower than in other parts of the UK.\nThe latest figures show 86,039 doses had been administered by 22:00 GMT on Sunday.\nA total of 327,000 doses - 280,000 of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 47,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - have now been delivered to the Welsh NHS.\nThe figures mean 2.7% of Wales population has so far been vaccinated - compared to just over 4% in Northern Ireland, about 3.5% in England and 3% in Scotland.\nAcross the UK nearly 400,000 second doses have been administered, including 374,613 in England, 79 in Wales, 13,949 in Northern Ireland and, as of January 3, 36 in Scotland.\nMr Gething admitted the rest of the UK had \"gone slightly faster than we have\", but said the latest vaccinations figures showed a \"significant acceleration\" in the rollout.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused the government of a \"stuttering start\", while Plaid Cymru said the plan was \"late in the day\". \nEveryone over 70, all care home residents and staff, and front-line NHS and social care workers will be offered a jab by mid-February, under similar timescales to other UK nations.\nThe Welsh Government's vaccination plans aim to cover 2.5 million people by September, with vaccines supplied by the UK government.\nMr Gething said: \"Delivering this vaccination programme to the people in Wales is a huge task but an enormous amount of work is going on to make it a success.\n\"We are making good progress with thousands more people being vaccinated every day.\"\nThe plan sets out a series of \"milestones\" for the vaccine rollout in Wales - all depending on the supply of vaccines approved for use.\nAt a press conference, Mr Gething said the government aimed to vaccinate:\nMr Gething said 700,000 people would be vaccinated by mid-February.\nAccording to the plan, the number of GPs' surgeries delivering vaccines will be increased from around 100 to more than 250 by the end of January.\nThe number of mass vaccination centres will increase in the next couple of weeks to 35, according to Welsh Government's plan.\nOne of those is Margam Orangery, in Neath Port Talbot, where about 500 people will be vaccinated each day. \nAt the press conference, Mr Gething defended the UK-wide decision to increase the gap between giving the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and said it would \"avoid more deaths\".\n\"Each of the vaccines provide a high level of protection against harm from coronavirus. That's really good news for all of us,\" he added.\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Government should have a vaccinations minister who \"gets up in the morning thinking about vaccinations and goes to bed thinking about vaccinations\". \nHe said such a move would help the government recover from a \"stuttering start\" to the vaccines programme. Mr Davies said the government needed \"focus and direction to drive this forward\". \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the strategy but said it was \"late in the day\".\nMr Price said many people, including his own parents, wanted clarity: \"My parents, who are in their 80s, have been told their surgery won't have the ability to vaccinate them for another three weeks, yet the GP surgery next door is starting this week.\"\nDaniel Davies, BBC Wales political correspondent\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is crucial to ensuring everyone aged over 70 can have at least one jab by Valentine's Day.\nHealth boards plan to use reserves of the Pfizer vaccine, but they alone will not reach the Welsh Government's first milestone. To speed things up, bigger supplies of the Oxford vaccine are needed. \nUnlike the Pfizer vaccine however, the stock is not held by the Welsh Government. Instead, it is delivered directly to the frontline - including GPs and community pharmacies - by Public Health England.\nAround 24,000 Oxford doses arrived in Wales last week; 26,000 are due this week; and another 80 to 100,000 are expected to arrive in four batches next week. \nIf the mid-February milestone is reached, attention then turns to the over-50s and younger people whose health puts them at greater risk.\nThey can expect a dose by the Spring, but discussions are continuing between the four UK nations to nail down a more specific date.\nDr Helen Alefounder is a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county and part of a team that administered 400 vaccines at care comes last week after receiving the vaccine herself on Wednesday.\n\"Between us and the surgery next door that we're working with we've got just shy of 20,000 patients to vaccinate,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"It's an absolutely huge task, it's really scary, but we are really keen and committed to get it done because everybody is sick of lockdown and let's be honest, everybody wants life to return to as normal as possible and the only way we're going to do that is to mass vaccinate people.\"\nOther GP surgeries have posted on social media that they have not received as many doses of the vaccine as promised. \nVaccination numbers will now be published daily and the number of mass vaccination centres will rise from 22 to 35. The vaccination plan also suggests pharmacies could be used to deploy the vaccine.\nDr Gill Richardson, the senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccination programme in Wales, said GPs were \"raring to go\" to get the vaccine distributed. \nShe said the model for Wales' vaccination programme was focused around the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, which was approved in late December and \"much larger quantities\" were expected. \nShe also said: \"I know it's very difficult if you haven't had a letter and you're feeling anxious but you are going to be approached and when you're approached we'd like it to be as soon as possible and as convenient as possible to you.\"\nMichael Sullivan, 93, from Radyr, Cardiff, is one of those who is yet to receive his letter. \nHe said: \"I hear of all these other people having their second jabs and nobody's even thought of contacting me to say I'm going to have one in the first place. It's a bit depressing. It makes me think somebody's not doing what they should be doing. \n\"It gets stressful more easily, that's another thing one has to bare in mind - it's going to save my life.\"\nElen Jones, the Wales director of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said community pharmacists were \"willing and skilled to help deliver the vaccination programme, as they do with flu every year\".\nShe added pharmacists could help deliver the vaccine \"at a more local level\".\nWelsh ministers have been under intense pressure since it became clear that Wales was lagging behind every other home nation in the initial weeks of vaccine rollout. \nIt's still not clear why that should be the case - the logistical challenges of rollout and the change in advice over the time period between first and second doses apply across the UK, not just to Wales. \nThe health minister says that there has already been \"a significant step-up in delivery\".\nThe test of that will be whether the system in Wales can meet the delivery goals set out in the vaccination strategy - which (as for the other home nations) also rely on a regular and sufficient supply of vaccine."

Officials said at the time that the haul could have been worth up to \u20ac1bn, depending on its purity. \nHigh-purity cocaine can be cut up or divided, with different substances added to increase profits when sold on the street. \nLast year, about 102 tonnes of cocaine was intercepted while heading for Europe."

But industry experts say the economics don't make sense as the batteries are heavy and hard to transport as they are not currently permitted through the Channel Tunnel for safety reasons. \nDoubts about the long-term future of the factory intensified after recent comments from the chief executive of the parent company Stellantis - the new name for the merged PSA and Fiat Chrysler.\nCarlos Tavares referred to the \"brutal\" decision for the UK government to bring forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 and said it might make more sense to move future electric production closer to its biggest market in the EU. \nGovernment officials are aware that the future of car production in the UK depends on a rapid scaling up of battery production and it is widely hoped Chancellor Rishi Sunak will address the issue in his Budget speech next Wednesday, which is coincidentally the same day that Stellantis announce their annual results and operating review."

      "text": "A senior NHS leader has reminded influential stars like Gwyneth Paltrow of their \"duty of responsibility\" when talking about Covid treatments.\nPaltrow recently wrote on her blog that contracting Covid-19 had left her with \"some long-tail fatigue and brain fog\".\nShe said a \"functional medicine practitioner\" had recommended an \"intuitive fasting\" healing regime.\nBut NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said some of her methods were \"really not the solutions we'd recommend\".\nAs part of her recovery, the Hollywood-star-turned-lifestyle-guru said she was on a mainly \"keto[genic] and plant-based\" diet, with no sugar or alcohol. She fasts until 11:00 every day and takes infrared saunas.\nProf Powis, who is national medical director for NHS England, said \"serious science\" should be applied.\n\"Like the virus, misinformation carries across borders and it mutates and it evolves,\" he said. \"So I think YouTube and other social media platforms have a real responsibility and opportunity here.\n\"In the last few days I see Gwyneth Paltrow is unfortunately suffering from the effects of Covid. We wish her well, but some of the solutions she's recommending are really not the solutions we'd recommend in the NHS.\n\"We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science. All influencers who use social media have a duty of responsibility and a duty of care around that.\"\nWhile Covid remains a short-lived sickness for many, others have found the effects last for weeks or months. According to the British Medical Journal, long Covid is thought to occur in around 10% of people infected, and concerns have been raised that there is not enough support for sufferers.\nWriting on her website Goop last week, Paltrow said she had caught the virus \"early on\".\n\"In January, I had some tests done that showed really high levels of inflammation in my body,\" she said.\n\"Everything I'm doing feels good, like a gift to my body. I have energy, I'm working out in the mornings, and I'm doing an infrared sauna as often as I can, all in service of healing.\"\nIn December, the 48-year-old - who made her name in films like Shakespeare in Love, Seven and Sliding Doors - said she cut back on movie-making after realising she \"doesn't love acting that much\".\nAs well as a blog, she now has a YouTube channel and podcast, which sees her talk to famous faces about their healthcare, lifestyle and wellness regimes.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Oatly, the plant-based milk company started in Sweden, is planning a stock exchange listing in the United States.\nThe move comes as the firm has been pushing to expand, amid the booming popularity of alternative milks.\nLast year, it raised $200m (\u00a3160m), drawing investment from celebrities including Jay-Z, Oprah Winfrey and Natalie Portman.\nThe firm, which is sold in more than 20 countries, did not say how much money it hoped to raise in the listing.\nBut over the last 12 months, investors have shown strong appetite for shares of companies making their publicly-traded debuts. Market valuations for firms such as Airbnb, dating app Bumble and food delivery platform Doordash have soared. \nOatly, an early oat milk pioneer, is said to be seeking a value of as much as $10bn, compared to the $2bn value suggested by July's investment round.\nFounded in the 1990s, previous investors include the state-owned China Resources and Verlinvest, a Belgium-based investment firm.\nWhen it launched in the US in 2016, the product was so popular it suffered shortages. It now boasts partnerships with retail giants such as Starbucks and has expanded its products from milk to ice cream and yogurt and is eyeing growth in China.\nResearchers have predicted that the market for dairy alternatives could almost double over the next five years, as increased dairy allergies and concerns about dairy's environmental impact push shoppers to look for plant-based options.\nIn the US, almond milk is the top seller, but oat passed soy last year to claim the second most popular spot.\nOatly, which reported more than $200m in sales in 2019, has cast itself as a champion of plant-based milks, which it says are better for the planet. \nBut the firm has been challenged by the traditional dairy industry and faces competition as companies such as PepsiCo's Quaker Oats and dairy giant HP Hood launch their own brands. New milk alternatives, made from products like peas, have also gained in popularity among consumers."

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh is being treated for an infection and is not expected to leave hospital for several days, Buckingham Palace has said.\nPrince Philip was admitted to London's King Edward VII's Hospital last Tuesday as a precaution after feeling unwell. \nThe 99-year-old husband of the Queen is \"comfortable and responding to treatment\", the palace said.\nThe Earl of Wessex said his father was feeling \"a lot better\" and appreciated \"lovely messages\" from the public.\nPrince Edward told Sky News: \"He's looking forward to getting out, which is the most positive thing, so we keep our fingers crossed.\"\nBoth the duke and the Queen, 94, received Covid-19 vaccinations last month. Prince Philip's admission to hospital was not related to coronavirus. \nThe couple, who celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary last November, have been spending lockdown at Windsor Castle with a small household staff.\nA palace source previously said that the duke, who turns 100 in June, had walked into the hospital in Marylebone unaided. \nPrince Charles visited his father for around 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon. \nA Clarence House spokesman said Prince Charles returned to his Highgrove residence in Gloucestershire after the visit.\nSpeaking on Monday, the Duke of Cambridge said his grandfather was \"OK\" and that doctors were \"keeping an eye\" on him.\nMembers of the Royal Family have continued with their official duties, with the Queen knighting a royal aide during a private socially-distanced ceremony at Windsor on Thursday.\nPrince Philip retired from royal duties in 2017 in a move supported by the Queen.\nKnown for off-the-cuff remarks at public events, Prince Philip joked at the time that he was the \"world's most experienced plaque unveiler\".\nIn his time as a working royal, he attended over 22,000 solo engagements and gave more than 5,000 speeches.\nThe duke has received treatment for various health conditions over the years, including a blocked coronary artery in 2011, a bladder infection in 2012 and exploratory surgery on his abdomen in June 2013."
