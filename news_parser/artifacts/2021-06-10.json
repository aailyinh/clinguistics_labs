      "text": "Oatly, the plant milk maker backed by Oprah Winfrey, is in a court battle with a Cambridgeshire farm over alleged trademark infringement.\nLawyers for Oatly sought a High Court injunction on Thursday to stop Glebe Farm Foods selling its PureOaty brand.\nOatly said it contacted the PureOaty makers in early 2020 saying \"their branding infringed our trademark\".\nFarmer Phillip Rayner, who owns Glebe Farm, said the PureOaty name was \"a nod to the purity of the product\".\nMr Rayner said that his company began producing the beverage using British-farmed oats about 18 months ago, but Oatly now wants Glebe Farm to stop using the PureOaty brand and change its packaging.\nThe Cambridgeshire farmer said: \"Oatly says the name and packaging is too similar to theirs, but when we compare the two products side by side, we are surprised by this.\"\nA spokesperson for Oatly said that since the 2020 letter, \"we unfortunately received no constructive response from them. We are therefore now involved in an ongoing court case and we have no further comment as we await the results.\"\nThe case at the London High Court is expected to conclude on Thursday.\nOatly, which was founded in the 1990s and produces a milk substitute made from oats, has grown rapidly in recent years.\nIts oat milk is now sold in 60,000 shops and more than 32,000 coffee shops across 20 countries and the company is now worth more than $15bn\nOther celebrity investors in the firm alongside Ms Winfrey include Jay-Z and Natalie Portman, It has also had investment from the state-owned China Resources and Verlinvest, a Belgium-based investment firm."

      "tags": "Schools,Ofsted",
      "text": "Some girls can be contacted by up to 11 boys a night asking for nude images, the schools watchdog for England says.\nIn an Ofsted survey, girls explained that if they blocked boys on social media \"they just create multiple accounts to harass you\".\nThe report also found nine in 10 girls believed that sexist name-calling and being sent unwanted explicit photos or videos happened \"a lot\" or \"sometimes\" between their peers. \nThe watchdog is warning that sexual harassment has become \"normalised\" among school-age children.\nStudents often do not see the point of reporting abuse and many teachers underestimate the scale of these problems, Ofsted says.\nIn the survey, girls said boys \"just won't take no for an answer\" when asking for explicit images.\nAt one school, the girls told inspectors they can be contacted by up to 10 or 11 different boys a night asking for nude or semi-nude images. \nWomen's groups are calling for school staff to be trained to change the culture and for a government taskforce.\nMinisters say schools and colleges will be encouraged to dedicate training days to help staff deal with sexual abuse. \nA BBC investigation has revealed at least 13,000 sex offences a year between under-18s have been reported to police in England and Wales between 2018 and 2020.   \nThirty police forces responded to a Freedom of Information request which revealed in about 2,000 cases, both the alleged victim and perpetrator were aged 10 or under. \nAbout 1,000 of the reported offences were about events happening on school premises.  \nThis echoes Ofsted's finding that inappropriate sexual behaviour is filtering down into primary schools.\nCerys, 21, said most girls she knows had received sexually explicit images from boys or men.\nShe said: \"When I was younger at school I received 50 or 60 on Instagram, Facebook Snapchat, images of privates that I didn't want to see. I think the first port of call is to go to your mum...you feel like 'I don't want to see that, I don't know what to do with that and no one's asked for it'. It's not very nice to receive it.\"\nLucy, 18, said that receiving nude photographs had become \"so normalised\" that if they appear in girls' social media message requests they \"just delete it\". \nShe said: \"Some girls do get it very often but it's something you brush away because it's not something you think of that's out of the ordinary... and there's nothing you can do about it.\"\nLucy said she did not think teachers knew what to do about the problem.\nCerys said: \"We were told if you're going to be involved in this then the police are going to be involved. It was more of a scary assembly rather than let's get all the girls together and tell them how to emotionally deal with receiving these kinds of images.\"\nAmy, not her real name, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when she was in sixth form she was raped after a party. \nNow 25, she believes there was a wider culture of sexual harassment that played a role in what happened to her.\nShe said: \"What was so challenging afterwards was when I tried to speak to friends I was fed back lines like 'Even if it was 80% him it was still 20% you' and 'Are you sure you didn't lead him on?'\nShe said a number of other girls told her they had had similar experiences and she knew she had to tell the school.\nShe said: \"It wasn't just one boy and me. It was a number of girls being affected by multiple boys doing these kinds of things.\"\nAmy said she was able to speak to a teacher and the support was \"overall overwhelmingly positive\".\nBut she believes the exchanging of nude images has \"got much worse\" in the years since she left school.\n\"Now I speak to younger people they just say [nude photographs] is what's expected. That's what being in a relationship is or that's what love is, or if you like someone you share a picture and if you don't then clearly you didn't like them,\" she said.\nOfsted visited 30 state and independent schools and two further education colleges and spoke to more than 900 young people about sexual harassment.\nSome 64% of girls thought that unwanted touching was experienced \"a lot\" or \"sometimes\" amongst their peers, while eight in 10 said the same of being pressured into sharing sexual images of themselves.\nChildren said sexual violence typically occurred in unsupervised spaces outside of school, like parties or parks.\nPupils in several schools said harmful sexual behaviour happens at house parties, without adults present, and that alcohol and drugs are often involved.\nMost students felt that the relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) they received at school did not give them the information and advice they needed to navigate the reality of their situations.\nGirls in particular were frustrated that there was not clear teaching about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.\nMany teachers said they lacked knowledge on topics such as consent, healthy relationships and sharing of sexual images.\nInspectors are urging school and college leaders to \"develop a culture\" where all types of sexual harassment are recognised and addressed.\nThey also say time should be set aside within the RSHE curriculum for topics that youngsters find difficult, such as consent and the sharing of explicit images.\nOfsted's review came after thousands of testimonies about abuse were posted on a website - Everyone's Invited - and the government asked inspectors to assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges.\nIn April, ministers also asked the NSPCC charity to run an abuse in education helpline, which will stay open until October.\nAs of Monday, the helpline had received 426 calls and helpline staff have made 80 referrals to external agencies, including the police or social services.\nOfsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said she was \"shocked\" that young people said it was a significant problem at every school the watchdog visited.\n\"It wasn't in some, it was in all of them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"This is a cultural issue - it's about attitudes and behaviours becoming normalised, and schools and colleges can't solve that by themselves.\"\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said Ofsted's review had \"rightly highlighted where we can take specific and urgent action to address sexual abuse in education\". But he said schools and colleges could not be expected to tackle these issues alone.\nThe Department for Education says teachers and school leaders will be better supported to recognise sexual harassment and abuse and teach confidently about issues of consent, online pornography and healthy relationships. \nThey will be encouraged to dedicate staff training days on how to deal with sexual abuse and harassment among pupils and how to deliver the new compulsory RSHE curriculum.\nThe End Violence Against Women Coalition called for a taskforce made up of the government, education leaders, and experts on violence against women and girls \"to advise on next steps and drive the rollout of a whole school approach\".\nPeter Wanless, head of the NSPCC, said young people had exposed what was happening and their voices must shape a whole-school approach to preventing harmful sexual behaviour.\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"It seems obvious that more must be done with greater urgency to tackle the misuse of social media and the availability of online pornography.\"\nA spokeswoman for Everyone's Invited called for an anonymous reporting system available in all schools. \n\"This would help reduce the massive gap between incidents and reporting emphasised in the Ofsted report,\" she said.\nThe Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 0800-2200, or 0900-1800 at weekends. It can also be contacted by email at help@nspcc.org.uk\nClarification 1 July 2021: Descriptions of the statistics have been edited to clarify that respondents referred to behaviours experienced by others their own age."

      "tags": "Film,Parenting",
      "text": "People are increasingly likely to use strong swearing in their everyday life, says research from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). \nThe body, which gives age ratings to films, says about a third of people in the UK are more likely to use strong swear words than five years ago.\nBut the research found parents did not want age restrictions weakened for swearing in movies and DVDs.\nParents wanted to protect children \"for as long as possible\" from swearing.\nThe BBFC also said it would treat acronyms such as \"WTF\" as though the full swear words had been spelt out, because the meaning was so widely recognised.\nThe report on swearing habits, based on research with 1,000 people, found about six in 10 people saw strong swearing, such as the F-word, as part of everyday life.\nA third were more likely to swear than five years ago, but there was a significant \"generational divide\", with 18 to 34 year olds most likely to swear and to be \"desensitised\" to its impact.\nAmong older people, strong swear words still remained a taboo - with 75% of those over 65 saying they would not use strong swearing in public, according to research which included focus groups and in-depth interviews.\n\"My son is exposed to strong language among his peers. I don't want him using it though.\" Mother of a 10-12 year old.\n\"My 15 year old son uses swearing among gaming friends casually. It's become a normal form of expression. Even my 13 year old thinks it's okay now, its become so normalised.\" Mother, aged 31-50\n\"There's a slippery slope with strong language creeping into films at younger ages. Where do you draw the line and say that's enough?\" Female, aged 31-50 \n\"I swear every day around friends. I don't use it in front of new people as I don't want them to get a bad impression of me.\" Female, aged 31-50\n\"My kids are 16 and 21 now. They hear strong language on a daily basis when out and about.\" Father of children aged 16-18.\nSource: BBFC\nParents were also keen to keep strong swearing away from their children - with about two thirds of parents saying while they might swear among their own friends they would avoid it if they thought their children, up to the age of 16, could hear.\nThere was also anxiety among parents about how much swearing could be \"normalised\" in the online video content available to young people.\nThe context also made a difference, with parents more worried if swearing was used in an aggressive or violent way, with a particular concern if it was used in terms of sexual violence.\nThe BBFC said the research suggested that while swearing might be increasingly used and tolerated, that parents did not want a dilution of the limits on how it appeared on-screen - such as not having very strong language in a 12A-rated film.\nThe strongest swear words should be infrequent for a 15 rating and if accompanied with violence they might need an 18 rating, said the BBFC.\n\"Children are watching more content on multiple screens, and their parents want to protect them from strong and very strong language wherever they can and for as long as possible. Parents told us they are keen for media industries to share the responsibility,\" said David Austin, the BBFC's chief executive."

      "tags": "Teaching,Scottish government,Schools,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish exam results,Scotland Education,Scottish Parliament,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that pupils will not have their results downgraded this year because of the past performance of their school.\nOpposition parties say the country is facing a similar \"shambles\" to last year, when thousands of pupils received lower grades than they were expecting.\nIn many cases, this was because of an algorithm that took into account how schools had performed in the past.\nBut the first minister said this year's system was a \"world away\" from that. \nMs Sturgeon was responding to claims by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross that the country's exams body was still seeking to use historical data this year - but was merely being more \"sleekit\" about how it was done.\nMr Ross told MSPs that an Education Scotland report published last week had said three quarters of Scottish councils were analysing results using historical data.\nAnd he questioned how young people could have faith in the system \"when the first minister's words do not match reality\".\nHe said: \"Inverclyde are holding data analysis meetings before submitting grades, Edinburgh are making adjustments based on previous attainment data and East Renfrewshire has a checklist to ensure that teachers compare this year's grades to the last three years. \n\"All of this in direct contradiction to the promise given by the first minister to this chamber last week, and reiterated a few moments ago.\"\nMr Ross went on to claim that this meant young people would \"once again lose out based solely on where they go to school\". \nHe added: \"This is the same shambles as last year - it's just more sleekit because instead of the SQA marking pupils down at the end of the process, the system will force teachers and schools to do it first.\" \nMs Sturgeon accused Mr Ross of misrepresenting how the system will work, adding: \"What Douglas Ross is trying to suggest happens is simply not the case.\"\nThe first minister said the awards this year are based on the judgement of teachers who look at the work pupils have done, and that there was \"no past results or algorithms that dictate what a learner's grade will be\".\nHowever, she said that a \"quality assurance process\" would then look at whether a school's provisional grades were \"significantly out of step with past performance\".\nIf that is the case, Ms Sturgeon said the provisional grades would be checked again by the relevant teachers rather than by the SQA or Education Scotland.\nShe added: \"If the teachers' judgement is that they stand by the result they gave, then that result stands - it is not changed.\n\"The provisional grades are then submitted to the SQA and they will not be changed because of a school's past performance. \n\"That is a world away from the situation last year where algorithms and the past performance of schools automatically changed the performance and the grades of some pupils.\"\nHer comments echo those of Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville, who gave a \"cast-iron guarantee\" earlier this week that the situation pupils faced last year would not happen again.\nBut Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said that the pledge \"means nothing without changes to the actual system\", which he said was still failing some pupils who were facing exceptional circumstances, such as bereavement, during the Covid pandemic.\nHe raised the case of a teenager who has been shielding and has been told he will get the class average mark for a subject despite achieving higher grades before he had to stop attending school in person.\nMr Sarwar also called for a \"no-detriment\" appeals policy to be put in place to prevent pupils having their results downgraded rather than upgraded if they choose to appeal.\nHe said the country was already in the midst of a \"second exams crisis\", and that the government had failed to fix the system despite having had a year to do so.\nScottish Greens education spokesman Ross Greer later said it was \"incorrect\" to say that the assessment system is based on teacher judgement, and accused the first minister of being either \"deliberately misleading\" or not understanding how grading will work.\nMr Greer said: \"The fact remains that if your teacher thinks you deserve an A but, for reasons of family bereavement or personal illness, your assessment evidence says B, they have to give you the B. \n\"This was always going to be the problem if you based a grading system on demonstrated attainment in a year where pupils have barely had a chance to demonstrate that attainment  due to school closures and self-isolation. \n\"The professional judgement of teachers simply isn't being respected.\"\nThe Scottish government was forced to u-turn and upgrade the results of about 75,000 pupils last year following an outcry over how the final grades had been decided after exams were cancelled because of the Covid pandemic.\nThe results were to have been decided based on teacher estimates for each of their pupils based on their work during the school year. \nThese estimated grades were then fed through an SQA moderation system, which downgraded many of the marks handed out by teachers to bring them closer in line with previous years.\nThis meant that the system was more likely to penalise pupils at schools which had historically not achieved high exam grades - often those in less affluent areas.\nMany pupils were also given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams at the start of the year.\nMs Sturgeon and John Swinney, who was the education secretary at the time, had both previously argued that basing grades on teacher estimates alone would damage the credibility of the results compared to previous years. \nBut they later told the SQA to reissue grades \"based solely on teacher or lecturer judgement\".\nLast week, Mr Swinney's successor as education secretary - Ms Somerville - announced that both the SQA and Education Scotland would be reformed."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "The gap between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is to be cut in Northern Ireland.\nCurrently, there is a gap of about 10 to 12 weeks between the two doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech.\nThis will now be reduced to a maximum of eight weeks, the Department of Health has confirmed. \nThe move is intended to offer better protection against the Delta - or Indian - variant, which is more transmissible.\nIt is understood the first dose is just 30% effective against it, while this increases to about 80% following a second dose. \nFor those who have not yet been vaccinated, appointments for second doses will be scheduled no more than eight weeks after the first dose. \nFor those who have already received their first dose, scheduled appointments for second doses will remain unaffected and people should keep the date they have been given. \nIn a statement, the department said these people have no need to contact the health service as there will be no change to their arrangements.\nIt said the move \"will accelerate the vaccination programme as it moves into its final phase and will ensure that people across NI have the strongest possible protection from variants of the Covid-19 virus\".  \nWhile not yet officially confirmed, it is thought there are approximately 80 cases of the Delta variant in Northern Ireland.\nWhile the number is small, it is the rate of increase that is worrying authorities.  \nThe number of cases has doubled since the weekend.  \nLast Friday, 26 Delta cases were confirmed by health officials, with surge testing taking place in Kilkeel.\nAction was taken in the County Down town after the cluster was detected and more than 1,000 people have volunteered to be tested as part of the precautionary measures.\nA new study indicates that both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant.\nIn January, the UK's chief medical officers defended the three-month gap between Covid vaccinations after criticism from a doctors' union about rescheduled appointments.\nThey said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) was \"confident\" 12 weeks was a reasonable interval between doses \"to achieve good longer-term protection\".\nOn Thursday, NI Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said the decision to reduce the interval between vaccine doses had been taken following updated advice from the independent experts at the JCVI, who had considered the latest available evidence on the Delta variant.\n\"They have recommended reducing the dosing interval to help protect the community from the increasing prevalence of this variant and others that may arise,\" Dr McBride said. \n\"It's vital that we move as quickly as possible, with the supplies of vaccine that we have available, to ensure that the maximum number of people receive both doses so that they have fuller and longer lasting protection against the virus.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, Queen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford backed the move to decrease the time between vaccine doses, saying it was likely to decrease the spread of the variant.\n\"It seems this variant can get past our first dose of vaccine,\" he said.\n\"So we need to make sure as many people as possible get their two doses and even think about decreasing the length between dose one and two because that's going to be critical going forward.\"  \nDr Bamford added that surge vaccinations were being looked at: \"We know this approach does work for other diseases.\" \nA programme to actively chase up all those over 50 who have not received the vaccine is also being planned by health authorities. \nWhile those numbers are not huge, transmission of the delta variant is causing a great deal of concern across the UK.  \nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter."

      "tags": "Eclipses",
      "text": "It's celestial showtime on Thursday as much of the Northern Hemisphere gets to witness a solar eclipse.\nThis particular event is what's termed an annular eclipse. It will see the Moon move across the face of our star but not completely block out the light coming from it.\nInstead, there will be just a thin sliver of brilliance left to shine around the Sun's disc.\nThe best of the action will be in the Arctic.\nYes, not many people live there, but a good portion of the globe will still get treated to a partial eclipse where the Moon appears to take a big bite out of the Sun.\nThis will include the eastern United States and northern Alaska, along with much of Canada, Greenland, and parts of Europe and Asia.\nIn the UK, the most favourable place to watch, in terms of the percentage of the Sun's disc that gets covered up, will be in Scotland - somewhere like Lerwick in the Shetland Islands (11:27 BST), or Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis (11:18 BST)\nThese places will see about 40% of the Sun eclipsed.\nBut even down south, in London (11:13 BST) for example, 20% of the star will be covered over. \nAs ever, the advice is not to try to look at the Sun with the naked eye. This can do severe damage.\nAnyone gazing skyward should only do so with the aid of protective viewing equipment, such as approved eclipse glasses or a pinhole projector.\nBetter still, attend an organised event. Local astronomy clubs will be out in force to show people how to view the eclipse safely.\nThere's some good advice here from BBC Sky At Night magazine and the Royal Astronomical Society and the Society for Popular Astronomy.\nThe so called \"path of annularity\" - the track across the Earth's surface where the Moon sits entirely within the Sun's disc to give the greatest spectacle - begins at sunrise in Ontario, Canada, at 09:49 GMT (10:49 BST).\nIt then sweeps across the top of the globe, including over the North Pole, to eventually reach Russia's Far East and lift off the planet at sunset at 11:33 GMT (12:33 BST).\nThe place which enjoys the greatest duration eclipse - at almost four minutes in length - is in the middle of the Nares Strait, the narrow channel that divides the Canadian archipelago from Greenland.\nThere'll be few there, however, to see 90% of the Sun's disc being blocked out. Perhaps only the odd walrus or two on an ice floe.\nFor all other locations, there are plenty of calculators out there where you can input your nearest city or town to get more relevant timings, such as here.\nNot every eclipse can be total. The Moon's orbit around the Earth is not perfectly round; the satellite's distance from the planet varies from about 356,500km to 406,700km (221,500 to 252,700 miles).\nThis difference makes the Moon's apparent size in the sky fluctuate by about 13%.\nIf the Moon happens to eclipse the Sun on the near side of its orbit, it totally blocks out the star (a total eclipse). But if the Moon eclipses the Sun on the far side of its orbit, as now, the satellite will not completely obscure the star's disc - and a \"ring of fire\" or annulus of sunlight is seen.\nBut no less wonderful. \n\"An eclipse gives us an opportunity to connect with the Sun,\" said Prof Lucie Green from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory.\n\"Normally, our star is so dazzlingly bright we kind of don't pay it much attention. But during an eclipse of one form or another, we're able - if we look safely - to watch the Moon glide in front of the Sun and remind ourselves of this clockwork Solar System we live in,\" she told BBC News."

Don't they have other things to worry about after we've all come through Covid?\"\nAnother said: \"I disagree with this. It should be addressed per child and not penalise the whole school.\"\nAbout 980 pupils attend the comprehensive and sixth form school. \nCampaign group Let Clothes Be Clothes said on social media: \"The skirts are school branded only, so how can they complain they're not fit for purpose?\n\"This head is not showing good leadership but allowing unaccountable strangers to police girls and female staff bodies and dress.\"\nIt is not the first time a school has banned skirts - in 2019, bans at both Appleton Academy in Wyke, West Yorkshire, and Stowmarket High School in Suffolk prompted criticism."

They had been in Fryent Country Park with friends celebrating Ms Henry's birthday.\nOpening the case, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said of the defendant: \"He promised to sacrifice women in order to win the lottery and not to be suspected of the crimes he had committed. \n\"It would appear that the defendant had confidence that his plan would work since following the fatal attacks upon Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, the defendant purchased several lottery tickets and there were three lottery tickets folded up inside the note [found in his room]. \n\"As it turned out, the demon did not come good on the bargain, since not only did the defendant not win the lottery but the police identified all the evidence that links him to these two murders.\"\nThe sisters had enjoyed Ms Henry's birthday celebrations so much that they decided to stay on at the park after their friends had left, the trial heard. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced.\nJurors were shown pictures of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry dancing with the lights shortly before they were attacked. Several photographs were taken in a burst, the prosecutor said.\nThe last photo, taken at 01:13 BST, shows the women looking to their left as if distracted by something, Mr Glasgow said.\n\"Whether this was the defendant who had crept up on them is unclear, but there is no doubt that he was in the park that evening and that he attacked them,\" he added.\nWhen the sisters failed to come home, their loved ones became concerned and some of their friends went to the park to look for them.\nPolice were alerted after the women's glasses were discovered and soon after a knife was found lying in the grass.\nAdam Stone, a friend of the sisters, was still on the phone to the police when he found their bodies.\nMr Glasgow told the jury: \"He ran towards the trees, forced his way through the bushes and this was when he discovered the two bodies.\"\nMr Glasgow suggested Ms Henry was taken by surprise and overpowered first, then Ms Smallman tried to fight off her attacker.\n\"Once the two sisters had been brutally murdered, their killer dragged their bodies across the grass and concealed them in a hedgerow,\" he said.\nThe court heard that a combination of forensic evidence and CCTV footage led police to Mr Hussein.\nHis DNA was at the scene, on the bodies of the victims and on a bloodstained knife found nearby, the jury heard.\nThe teenager, who had bought a set of knives from Asda in the days before the attack, went to hospital the day after the killings, the Old Bailey was told. He had cuts to his hand from a knife.\nJurors were told more about the note found on a glass table in his bedroom when police searched his home. \nIn it, he expressed intentions to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot, the court heard.\nMr Glasgow said Mr Hussein denied that he wrote the note.\n\"Given it was found in his bedroom, has his finger and thumbprints upon it, and is signed in his name and in his blood, the identity of the author may not prove difficult to discern,\" Mr Glasgow added.\nThe trial, which is set to last four weeks, continues."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government acted unlawfully when it awarded a \u00a3560,000 contract to a firm run by former colleagues of Michael Gove and the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings, the High Court has ruled.\nMr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, denied any favouritism had been shown to market research agency Public First.\nBut the judge said a failure to consider other firms could be seen as suggesting a \"real danger\" of bias.\nPublic First looked into public understanding of coronavirus.\nCampaigners took legal action against Mr Gove over the Cabinet Office's decision to use the company following the start of the pandemic last year.\nThey also questioned the involvement of Mr Cummings, who worked in Downing Street until he quit as the prime minister's chief adviser last autumn.\nLawyers for the Good Law Project argued that Mr Cummings wanted focus group and communications support services work to be given to Public First, whose founding partners were Rachel Wolf and James Frayne.\nIn 2011, Mr Frayne became director of communications at the Department of Education, where he worked alongside Mr Cummings, who was a special adviser to Mr Gove, the then education secretary.\nMs Wolf formerly worked as an adviser to Mr Gove and for Mr Cummings, and co-wrote the Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto. \nThe government and Mr Cummings disputed the Good Law Project's claim.\nDelivering her ruling, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said: \"The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful.\"\nShe said: \"The defendant's failure to consider any other research agency, by reference to experience, expertise, availability or capacity, would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, that the decision-maker was biased.\"\nBut she also said: \"The fair-minded and informed observer would have appreciated that there was an urgent need or research through focus groups on effective communications in response to the Covid-19 crisis and that those research services were required immediately.\"\nMr Cummings had been \"uniquely placed, given his experience and expertise, to form a rapid view on which organisation might best be able to deliver those urgent requirements\", the judge said.\nThe High Court rejected two other claims made against the government by the Good Law Project.\nThe first was that the \"direct\" award of the contract to Public First was \"unnecessary\" because there were other firms who could potentially have done the work.\nThe second was that giving it a six-month contract was \"disproportionate\" for the government's \"immediate\" needs - and that a shorter arrangement could have been followed by a \"competitive process\" for a longer contract.\nIn his witness statement, Mr Cummings told the court: \"The country was facing an unprecedented national emergency. Thousands of lives were at stake, hundreds of billions of pounds were at stake.\n\"The extra money spent on doubling the focus groups and polling was essentially irrelevant in those circumstances.\n\"A few people did raise the question of how we could justify this as value for money. I responded that this was not the normal world, we were in a once-a-century pandemic and many thousands of pounds here was trivial if it helped us save lives and minimise economic destruction.\"\nAfter the High Court ruling, he tweeted: \"When it became clear [the Department of Health, Public Health England and the Cabinet Office] weren't gathering vital data, I acted urgently. This data immediately helped key decisions and saved lives.\"\nBut Good Law Project director Jo Maugham said: \"This is not government for the public good - it is government for the good of friends of the Conservative Party.\"\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the government of acting \"immorally and unethically\".\n\"In the middle of a deadly pandemic not only were those at the heart of government giving out taxpayers' money to their friends and associates, they have wasted even more trying to cover it up,\" she added.\nHowever, a Public First spokesman said the company was \"deeply proud of the work we did in the early stages of the pandemic, which helped save lives\".\nHe added: \"The judge rejected most of the Good Law Project's claims, not finding actual bias in the awarding of this work, nor any problems with the pace or scale of the award.\"\nAnd the Cabinet Office said: \"The judgement makes clear that there was no suggestion of actual bias and that the decision to award the contract was not due to any personal or professional connections.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing",
      "text": "There are still \"serious problems\" among private Covid testing firms, with rogue operators making misleading claims, says consumer group Which?.\nMost travellers to the UK are required to pre-book tests for day two and day eight after their return.\nBut several test providers on a government approved list are offering misleading information about pricing and availability, Which? found.\nThe Department for Health said it was carefully monitoring test providers.\nProblems with private test providers first came to light in April when there was an increase in the number of people travelling. Several firms, listed by the government as approved providers, failed to deliver test kits on time, or failed to return results.\nTravellers were left quarantining at home unsure how to meet government testing requirements and in many cases unable to reach the testing companies online or by phone.\nSome didn't receive test kits at all, despite having paid hundreds of pounds. A few received results for tests they hadn't taken. \nSince 17 May the rules on international travel have been eased, and the vast majority of countries are on the government's \"amber\" list meaning travellers, including UK nationals, must pre-book a two-test package before they are allowed into the UK.\nNow, Which? has found some providers are quoting headline prices for one test, when two are required. Others are marketing tests although they aren't ready to deliver them.\n\"Weeks on from some international travel being allowed to resume, it's very concerning to still be uncovering such serious problems with the government's testing system for travellers - problems that could have easily been ironed out well ahead of travel restarting, had proper regulatory oversight been ensured early on,\" said Rory Boland, travel editor at Which?\n\"As it stands, travellers risk being left at the mercy of rogue operators who, at best, attempt to profiteer off of those looking for testing services to allow them to travel, and at worst, risk leaving them out of pocket for services that don't even exist.\"\nHe said the government needed to sort out problems at testing firms before mass travel resumes, to avoid \"chaos for travellers\". \nConfused pricing\nIn late May, Which? investigated the three cheapest offers, that appeared on the list of approved providers from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).\nThe prices offered by Biograd Diagnostics, Screen 4 and Book A Travel Test were between \u00a360 and \u00a398. However, when Which? investigated further it found the quoted prices were for a single test, not the compulsory two-test package.\nThe firms involved said the problem lay with how the DHSC recorded price information.\n\"A number of companies including ourselves were initially confused by the government listing forms,\" said a Book A Travel Test spokesperson.\n\"We have gone to great lengths to support travellers, however, we are not immune to costs and have had to navigate fluctuating charges from labs. We remain committed to doing all we can to deliver an excellent service to travellers during this difficult time.''\nA Screen 4 spokesperson said the problem lay in \"differences in terminology\".\n\"We do not and have never tried to manipulate the listings and we have tried to provide a competitive and reliable service with clearly stated capacity of tests available,\" Screen 4 said.\nFollowing Which's enquiries the headline listed prices of several firms rose.\nHowever Which? said the underlying problem had not been corrected, as subsequently other firms were still quoting prices for a single test, making it appear that tests are available at half the true cost.\nWhich? also found that among the DHSC's accredited providers, several were not yet able to provide tests. Following Which?'s enquiries three firms were removed from the list.\nThe consumer group said taken together the problems suggested a lack of regulatory oversight and called for the government to explore options for reducing the cost of testing and to ensure providers were offering accurate information.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"The government regularly evaluates all providers' performance, including their delivery and test turnaround times.\n\"Providers who do not meet the minimum standards set by DHSC and reviewed by the independent United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), or where our monitoring highlights concerns about their customer service performance, are removed from the gov.uk travel test list. Additionally, providers may not appear on the list where they are temporarily out of stock.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Arlene Foster,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"Normality, as we knew it in 2019, is still some way off,\" the health minister has said. \nThe remarks by Robin Swann were in a briefing document from the Department of Health to the NI Executive. \nMr Swann said Northern Ireland is \"not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing\".\nThe health paper also said testing for coronavirus over the past few days has indicated that up to 25% of new cases here may be the Delta variant. \nThe document warns of another possible \"significant fresh surge\" of positive cases and hospitalisations by late summer or early autumn. \nIt says the Delta variant, which originated in India, is more transmissible, and is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission.\nVaccination is working, it states, and \"the more people we can get fully vaccinated the stronger our protection will be\".\nThe Public Health Agency has said 111 probable and confirmed cases of the Delta variant have been detected throughout all 11 local council areas in Northern Ireland, 28 of them are in Kilkeel.\nCases of the variant were first confirmed in Northern Ireland in early May.\nThe NI Executive met on Thursday to discuss further relaxations of Covid restrictions.\nMr Swann said while the number of Delta cases remained small, there were \"grounds for concern\", and evidence from Great Britain showed its potential to spread quickly. \nThe use of face coverings was also expected to continue, he said. \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there was cause for \"worry\". \n\"We're naturally worried whenever we look at predictions and modelling for what could potentially happen,\" she said.  \n\"Some of the modelling suggests we will have a significant rise in positive cases.\"\nMs O'Neill said Chief Medical officer Dr Michael McBride said there should be clearer picture by mid July. \nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the Delta variant is more transmissible and \"we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens\". \nStormont ministers have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music to resume across venues in NI. \nHowever, it will need to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. \nNo live music is permitted in pubs, hotels and clubs under current Covid-19 regulations, with many venues closed to audiences since March 2020.\nIt is understood the Executive also agreed proposals to raise limits on social contact at home from 21 June.\nThis would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home.\nThe number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date.\n21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment.\nAlong with the other proposals on rules regarding live music in licensed and unlicensed venues, the changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer.\nTheatres may also be set to reopen on 21 June, if the executive gives the green light next week.\nQueen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford has said delaying the easing of restrictions may \"put us in better stead going into the coming months\".\nHe said some modelling of the new Delta variant suggested its spread could result in a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths, despite a large portion of the adult population being vaccinated.\n\"There are still a lot of people at risk, without vaccines, with one dose of vaccine, and this is, of course, more transmissible,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"I think that possibly delaying the relief of these restrictions might be the best thing to do in the next couple of weeks, until we have more information and more time for that public health acting to act and also to get more people with two-dose vaccinations.\"\nLiam McFeely, singer with The Goodfellas, one of the north west's best-known wedding bands, said it was vital the return of live music got the go-ahead.\n\"People are on aeroplanes, they are in cinemas tonight, which is fantastic, but still no dancing, no signing, no music,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"For some reason, for music and entertainment there was no happy medium, it was just stop, no dancing,\" he said.\nMusicians, he added, have endured an \"absolutely brutal, horrendous\" time since March 2020. He estimated lockdown cost him \"thousands of pounds\" in lost earnings.\n\"We lost 60 weddings in three weeks, that's my livelihood, that was the beginning,\" he said.\n\"You keep things for a rainy day but when you have three kids at uni, the rainy days are every day\".\nThursday's executive meeting was also Arlene Foster's last as Northern Ireland's first minister, as she prepares to step down.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons are also due to leave their posts, as DUP leader Edwin Poots prepares to move his new team into office.\nOn Wednesday, the incoming Economy Minister Paul Frew said he wanted to see a \"stocktake\" of the coronavirus restrictions.\nHe said: \"There are some restrictions that are still in place and have been in place over the past month that are not logical.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Healthcare,Coronavirus testing,Care homes,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "After a bruising few weeks, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is appearing in front of a committee of MPs at 0930 on Thursday to answer questions about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt comes after Mr Hancock was accused by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's former top aide, of a string of mistakes - and of lying to the prime minister - at the start of the crisis, in an appearance before the same committee two weeks ago.\nMr Hancock has firmly and repeatedly denied the claims - and the chairs of the joint committee on Covid, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt, have written to Mr Cummings to ask for evidence to back up his assertions, before grilling the health secretary. They have yet to receive a reply.\nBut with a public inquiry into the pandemic not due until 2022, all eyes will be on the health secretary's evidence session. Here are some of the questions he is facing.\nThis question centres around whether people were discharged from hospital to care homes without being tested for Covid, leading to the virus taking hold among vulnerable people. \nMore than 42,000 care home residents in England and Wales have died of Covid.\nMr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of misleading Prime Minister Boris Johnson about testing, during his seven-hour appearance before the science and health committees.\nThe former aide said that both he and the PM were \"told categorically in March (2020) that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened\".\nHe added: \"Now the government rhetoric was we put a shield around care homes and blah blah blah - it was complete nonsense. Quite the opposite of putting a shield around them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.\"\nMr Hancock has denied lying. He said he had been clear it would take time for hospitals to get up to speed with testing patients returning to care homes.\n\"My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,\" he told a Downing Street press conference last month.\n\"I then went away and built the testing capacity\u2026 and then delivered on the commitment that I made.\"\nBut care home leaders say they did not get the support they needed. Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, told Sky News it had been a \"frightening\" time for staff and residents.\n\"I don't believe myself there was a ring of protection thrown round us,\" Mr Padgham said. \"In those very early days it was difficult. We were forgotten.\n\"It took the government many, many weeks to actually see what was happening in homes, despite our best efforts and protestations.\"\nMr Cummings also alleged that last year Mr Hancock interfered with NHS Test and Trace to make sure he could hit a self-imposed target.\nThe health secretary had publicly promised that the government would be carrying out 100,000 Covid tests a day by the end of April. He claimed to have reached the goal - although he was counting tests that had not yet been processed. \nMr Cummings said: \"I started getting calls and No 10 were getting calls saying 'Hancock is interfering with the building of the test and trace system because he is telling everybody what to do to maximise his chances of hitting his stupid target by the end of the month'.\"\nHe also claimed Mr Hancock was calling people and asking them to \"hold tests back so I can hit my target\".\n\"In my opinion he should've been fired for that thing alone, and that itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by different parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in different ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say 'look at me and my 100k target'. It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm,\" he added.\nAddressing these claims in Parliament, Mr Hancock said: \"Setting and meeting ambitious targets is how you get stuff done in government.\"\nMr Cummings said that the government pursued a strategy of herd immunity - where the virus is allowed to spread so people catch it and develop immunity.\nThe government has repeatedly denied that herd immunity was ever part of the plan. \nMr Hancock has yet to address this claim directly.\nReferring to Mr Hancock, Mr Cummings said: \"In the summer he said everyone who needed treatment got the treatment that they required. He knew that that was a lie. Because he'd been briefed by the chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer himself about the first peak and we were told explicitly that people did not get the treatment that they deserved. \n\"Many people were left to die in horrific circumstances.\"\nMr Hancock has yet to respond directly to this claim.\nThe lack of adequate protective equipment for health and social care staff was a key feature of the pandemic's first wave.\nMr Cummings said that when he returned to No 10 in April, having been ill with Covid himself, \"the first meeting I had in the cabinet room was about the disaster over PPE and how we were actually completely short and hospitals all over the country were running out\".\nHe said that in that meeting, Mr Hancock told ministers the shortage was the \"fault\" of Sir Simon Stevens, who leads NHS England, and of Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who he said had \"blocked approvals on all sorts of things\". \nMr Cummings added: \"I said to the cabinet secretary, 'please investigate this and find out if it's true'. The cabinet secretary came back to me and said 'it's completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the secretary of state's honesty in these meetings'.\"\nMr Hancock denied these allegations in a Commons statement, saying: \"These unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true, and that I have been straight with people in public and in private throughout\".\n\"Every day since I began working on the response to the pandemic last January, I have got up each morning and asked, 'What must I do to protect life?' That is the job of a health secretary in a pandemic.\""

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has launched his first official overseas trip with a warning to Russia that it faces \"robust and meaningful\" consequences if it engages in \"harmful activities\".\nMr Biden made clear his intention to strengthen ties with US allies, following strained relations under the Trump administration.\nPresident Biden arrived in the UK on Wednesday.\nHe will meet PM Boris Johnson to agree a new \"Atlantic Charter\".\nThe pact will be a modern version of the one agreed between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in 1941, with a focus on challenges including climate change and security.\nThe BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, says the two are aiming to refresh a vital relationship, after the turbulence of the Trump years and the pressures of the pandemic.\nDuring a packed eight-day European visit Mr Biden will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle, attend a G7 leaders' meeting, and join his first Nato summit as president.\nAt the end of his trip Mr Biden is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva. \nThe White House has indicated that he intends to cover a \"full range of pressing issues\" with his Russian counterpart, including arms control, climate change, Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Russia's cyber-hacking activities and the jailing of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.\nThree organisations linked to Mr Navalny were outlawed by a Moscow court on Wednesday for being \"extremist\".\nAddressing US troops and their families at the RAF Mildenhall airbase in Suffolk on Wednesday, where he landed before travelling on to Cornwall, Mr Biden said he would deliver a clear message to Mr Putin.\n\"We're not seeking conflict with Russia,\" he said. \"We want a stable and predictable relationship ... but I've been clear: The United States will respond in a robust and meaningful way if the Russian government engages in harmful activities.\"\nTies between Washington and Moscow are at a low point over a variety of issues. In April, Mr Putin accused Western powers of trying to \"pick on\" Russia and warned them not to cross a \"red line\".\nMr Biden said that \"at every point\" during his first overseas trip as president he wanted to make it clear that \"the United States is back and democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges, and the issues that matter most to our future\".\nOther leaders of the G7 (Group of Seven) will arrive in Cornwall, south-west England, on Friday and meetings will take place over the weekend.\nThe G7 is made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - plus the EU.\nThe main topic of conversation will be Covid recovery, including \"a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics\".\nIn an article for the Times, Boris Johnson said the G7 would \"begin the framing of a new global treaty on pandemic preparedness so the world is never caught out in the same way again\".\nThe Biden administration has said it plans to provide 500 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to about 100 countries over the next two years.\nThe G7 agenda also includes climate change and trade.\nMr Biden is expected to warn that the UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland. He will call on fellow leaders to protect the gains of the Good Friday agreement.\nAt the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document outlining what has been agreed by the leaders.\nAfter the G7, Mr Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle before flying to Brussels for talks with Nato on Monday and the EU on Tuesday.\nUS ties with Nato were strained under Donald Trump, but Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg - visiting the White House on Monday - hailed Mr Biden's \"powerful commitment\" to America's allies."

      "tags": "Global economy,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic,G7",
      "text": "The US was worst hit by the pandemic in the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures.\nThe analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall.\nIt measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year.\nLast year, an earlier BBC study showed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. \nThe analysis shows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations. \nHowever, the UK's worse outcomes in the first wave, and a significant peak of deaths in December and January, still mean that overall UK outcomes were second worst, on one measure just behind the US. \nThe other G7 countries - Italy, France, Canada, Germany and Japan - had fewer excess deaths, with the latter three significantly fewer. \nThe principal measure of comparison is excess deaths. This is the percentage of above normal deaths over the year, which can help account for different measurement techniques in different countries. \nIt is a measure of the overall impact of the pandemic, including directly from the disease and from the response to it. \nThe raw numbers of reported Covid-19 deaths show the UK as the worst in the G7, but most analysts believe there has been structural under-reporting of Covid deaths in the US, which has seen far less testing, making the excess deaths comparison more appropriate.\nThe analysis shows that between March 2020 and February 2021, there were a fifth more deaths than in a normal year for the US (+20.2%) and  a little bit under a fifth for the UK (+19.6%), \nItaly was lower, but still significantly hit (+17%), French excess deaths were one-10th higher (+10.2%), and then Canada (+5.1%) and Germany (+4.9%) saw deaths only one-20th up on normal. \nJapan's deaths (-1.4%) were actually lower over this first year than would have been expected. \nAnother measure, adjusted for the size of population, showed that there were 227 excess deaths for every 100,000 people in the US.\nThere were just under that both for the UK (181) and Italy (180). France was clearly lower at 125. Canada (92) and Germany (92) had an excess death rate below one in 1,000. And Japan's figure was lower still (47).\nComparing the pandemic waves over the course of the year shows that the level of excess deaths in the US remained high between peaks and never fell back to zero. This reflects an absence of lockdowns and different policies across different US states.\nCharles Tallack from the Health Foundation said: \"Understanding how similar countries have fared over the pandemic is a vital part of learning lessons for the future. \n\"Excess deaths - how many more deaths there have been than in a usual year - is generally regarded as an objective and fair way of comparing countries.\n\"Over the first year of the pandemic, the US comes out as the worst affected country in the G7 with deaths of up to 25% more than usual. \n\"The UK is not far behind in second place. Japan has fared best followed by Germany. These rankings remain the same even when we use slightly different approaches, so we're confident that they provide a fair comparison of the first year.\"\nOther metrics showed that the US has had the fastest economic bounce-back, already having made up the lost growth in the pandemic. The US economy is forecast to grow 6.9% this year, after a fall of 3.5% last year. \nThe UK is expected to grow a similar amount at 7.2% this year, but that is after the largest fall in the G7 in 2020 of -9.8%. Canada is also bouncing back fast, with growth forecast this year of more than 6%, after a relatively modest hit last year of 5%.\nThere have also been marked differences within the G7 on the rollout of vaccinations. \nThe share of the population that is fully vaccinated almost exactly follows the countries most hit by the pandemic. The US has vaccinated the most, alongside the UK, followed by Italy. \nJapan has vaccinated the least, then Canada, with France and Germany in the middle. "

      "text": "Boris Johnson says it is clear that Covid cases are rising and hospitalisations increasing, as a decision on 21 June unlocking looms.\nOfficial figures show more than 1,000 people in the UK are currently in hospital with the disease.\nThe PM said he needed to assess the extent to which the vaccine rollout has built up protection in the population before progressing with the roadmap.\nAnd he said again that the decision for England would be \"driven by the data\".\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus has risen above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May.\nScientists believe this could be the start of the third wave, caused by the Delta variant.\nThe size of that wave depends on how effective vaccines are at protecting people  - and that is still uncertain.\nThe government is due to decide on 14 June whether to lift the last remaining restrictions in England. \nBut government sources are more downbeat about the prospect of the easing going ahead the following week.\nSpeaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 summit, the prime minister said there are \"arguments being made one way or another\" as to whether all restrictions can be lifted as planned.\n\"What everybody can see very clearly is that cases are going up and, in some places, hospitalisations are going up.\n\"What we need to assess is the extent to which the vaccine rollout, which has been phenomenal, has built up enough protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage.\"\nMr Johnson added: \"The reason we've been doing the steps on the roadmap with five-week intervals is to give us time to look at all the data as it comes in and access the state of the pandemic before we go forward to the next step. \n\"So on Monday that four-week period will be up - and we'll look at where we are.\"\nIt comes as one million under 30s booked vaccine appointments in England on Tuesday - and data showed more than half the adult population is fully vaccinated.\nProf Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College London whose predictions were key to the first lockdown in March 2020, has said that delaying unlocking would allow more people to be vaccinated. \nWhile a first dose gives some protection against the Delta variant, first detected in India, the second dose appears to give much more.\nAnother 7,540 people tested positive for the coronavirus in the UK on Wednesday - the highest daily number of cases since the end of February, the latest government figures show.\nThere were also a further six deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. A week ago there were 4,330 cases and 12 deaths.\nA total of 1,024 people are now being treated in hospital in the UK, up 69 on the previous figure.\nTo date, most of those in hospital have not been vaccinated or had only one dose, with very few fully vaccinated.\nProf Ferguson said it was still not clear how the rise in cases would translate into hospitalisations and it would take a few more weeks to find out.\nIt was always expected cases would rise at this stage - indoor mixing is the move that allows the virus to spread most easily.\nBut what's concerning government scientists is how quickly cases are going up because of the Delta variant, and how that has begun to translate into hospitalisations.\nThe hope was the vaccination success would lead to a slower increase in infections and hospital admissions would be flatter.\nVaccines have weakened the link between the two. The rate of admission seems to be about half of what it was in September when infection levels were last climbing like this.\nBut that may not be enough. One hope is the rise in infections could fizzle out given the immunity that has built up in the population.\nAnd there are suggestions those admitted now are not as sick as those admitted last year. Patients appear to be younger and not needing as much treatment. \nBut the lack of certainty means government scientists are suggesting extra time may be needed before the complete unlocking of society.\nThis will have a double benefit - allowing more time to gather data and increasing the numbers vaccinated.\nExperts say there is still much about the Delta variant and how well vaccines work against it that is unknown.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock previously said the variant was 40% more transmissible than the Alpha (or Kent) variant, but Prof Ferguson's \"best estimate\" is 60%.\n\"Almost certainly I think deaths probably will be lower [than the second wave] - the vaccines are having a highly protective effect, cases in hospital now are milder - but it still could be quite worrying,\" Prof Ferguson said.\nThe rises in hospital cases are mainly driven by increases in Scotland and the north-west of England.\nThis is where cases have been rising for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. \nVaccines and tests are being offered more quickly to people in Greater Manchester and Lancashire in a bid to suppress cases of the new variant, as Bolton has been able to do.\nThe town saw a recent drop in infection rates and the government is now planning the same approach in other parts of the region.\nMeanwhile, a record million jabs were booked on Tuesday when those aged 25 to 29 became eligible for the vaccine in England, according to new figures.\nThe NHS in England said 100,000 appointments were being booked every hour at the height of the surge.\nSir Simon Stevens, its chief executive, said bookings reaching an all-time high showed enthusiasm for the vaccination programme \"remains strong\".\nHe added: \"The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones.\""

      "text": "A High Court judge has ruled a family can challenge prosecutors for failing to charge a boy who allegedly caused another teenager's river death.\nChristopher Kapessa was reportedly pushed into the River Cynon in Rhondda Cynon Taf in 2019.\nAlthough police found evidence he was pushed, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to prosecute.\nMrs Justice Cheema-Grubb allowed an application by Christopher's mother Alina Joseph for a judicial review.\n\"To achieve permission, there must be properly arguable grounds with a realistic prospect of success,\" she told the court.\n\"Having had the advantage of hearing argument, I grant permission to apply for judicial review.\"\nJudicial review is a procedure that allows anyone who has been affected by a decision or a failure to act by a public authority to apply to the courts to rule whether its actions were lawful or not.\nThe judge allowed the application on five grounds, including that the CPS's decision failed to \"properly value human life\" and that \"undue and improper weight\" was given to the impact of the prosecution on the teenage suspect.\nThe CPS had said it was not in the public interest to prosecute the boy, who was 14 at the time, and strongly denied race played any part in its decision - as claimed by Christopher's mother.\nMichael Mansfield QC, representing Christopher's family, told the court sympathy for the teenage suspect \"does not come into\" the decision whether to prosecute, adding: \"Yes, it is a young person, but as was the person who died.\"\nMr Mansfield argued that there was a large enough public interest in prosecuting the boy, as well as evidence to hold a trial.\nHe added: \"It is very rare indeed that a prosecution for homicide does not follow once the evidential threshold has been crossed.\n\"We say that this is a case where the prosecutor would be bound to come to the conclusion that it is in the public interest for those matters to be reviewed.\"\nThe High Court heard there were 16 people at the scene of the incident near Mountain Ash on 1 July 2019, and Mr Mansfield alleged some of them had not been honest with the police.\nHe said: \"The young people, plainly, to begin with - or some of them, we don't know how many - decided either together or apart that they were not going to reveal who did what, let alone what happened.\"\nHe later added: \"What sort of message does that communicate to the community of young people if he is not prosecuted?\n\"That it is all right to lie? That it is all right not to disclose? A responsible citizen would find that abhorrent.\"\nDuncan Penny QC, representing the CPS, argued the decision to bring a prosecution in any case is not automatic even if there is a high public interest, and that the family's arguments had been addressed in the original review by the body.\nThe CPS will now have 21 days to provide evidence to prepare for the judicial review, including the evidence used to come to the decision not to prosecute.\nMs Joseph, who has pledged to launch her own legal action if the decision is not overturned, previously told BBC Wales Investigates she believed if Christopher had been white, the investigation \"would have been very different\".\nHowever, on Thursday, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb rejected the claim that the CPS failed to consider the public interest in showing there is no racial bias in charging decisions.\nChristopher - The Boy Who Never Came Home is on BBC iPlayer"

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "The gap between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is to be cut in Northern Ireland.\nCurrently, there is a gap of about 10 to 12 weeks between the two doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech.\nThis will now be reduced to a maximum of eight weeks, the Department of Health has confirmed. \nThe move is intended to offer better protection against the Delta - or Indian - variant, which is more transmissible.\nIt is understood the first dose is just 30% effective against it, while this increases to about 80% following a second dose. \nFor those who have not yet been vaccinated, appointments for second doses will be scheduled no more than eight weeks after the first dose. \nFor those who have already received their first dose, scheduled appointments for second doses will remain unaffected and people should keep the date they have been given. \nIn a statement, the department said these people have no need to contact the health service as there will be no change to their arrangements.\nIt said the move \"will accelerate the vaccination programme as it moves into its final phase and will ensure that people across NI have the strongest possible protection from variants of the Covid-19 virus\".  \nWhile not yet officially confirmed, it is thought there are approximately 80 cases of the Delta variant in Northern Ireland.\nWhile the number is small, it is the rate of increase that is worrying authorities.  \nThe number of cases has doubled since the weekend.  \nLast Friday, 26 Delta cases were confirmed by health officials, with surge testing taking place in Kilkeel.\nAction was taken in the County Down town after the cluster was detected and more than 1,000 people have volunteered to be tested as part of the precautionary measures.\nA new study indicates that both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant.\nIn January, the UK's chief medical officers defended the three-month gap between Covid vaccinations after criticism from a doctors' union about rescheduled appointments.\nThey said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) was \"confident\" 12 weeks was a reasonable interval between doses \"to achieve good longer-term protection\".\nOn Thursday, NI Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said the decision to reduce the interval between vaccine doses had been taken following updated advice from the independent experts at the JCVI, who had considered the latest available evidence on the Delta variant.\n\"They have recommended reducing the dosing interval to help protect the community from the increasing prevalence of this variant and others that may arise,\" Dr McBride said. \n\"It's vital that we move as quickly as possible, with the supplies of vaccine that we have available, to ensure that the maximum number of people receive both doses so that they have fuller and longer lasting protection against the virus.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, Queen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford backed the move to decrease the time between vaccine doses, saying it was likely to decrease the spread of the variant.\n\"It seems this variant can get past our first dose of vaccine,\" he said.\n\"So we need to make sure as many people as possible get their two doses and even think about decreasing the length between dose one and two because that's going to be critical going forward.\"  \nDr Bamford added that surge vaccinations were being looked at: \"We know this approach does work for other diseases.\" \nA programme to actively chase up all those over 50 who have not received the vaccine is also being planned by health authorities. \nWhile those numbers are not huge, transmission of the delta variant is causing a great deal of concern across the UK.  \nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter."

      "tags": "Bridgend County Borough Council",
      "text": "Bridgend's largest secondary school has apologised to former pupils who were sexually abused by a former head of art over a period of 29 years.\nClive Hally taught at Brynteg Comprehensive for 36 years, until retiring in 2011. \nAfter two complainants came forward he was found dead, aged 67, on the day he was due to answer bail in 2019. \nA Bridgend council-commissioned investigation revealed Hally had admitted some allegations.\nFive more men have since come forward with complaints spanning a 29-year period from 1980 to 2009, South Wales Police said following a Freedom of Information request by BBC Wales.\nOne of the original complainants, Mark Woods, called Hally \"a sick individual\".\nPolice said there was also an additional, separate investigation into the conduct of another former teacher at the school, after a former pupil alleged they were sexually assaulted in the 1970s. This complainant subsequently withdrew their complaint. \nThe Bridgend council investigation found staff had \"expressed concerns\" about Hally's behaviour, with a report adding: \"There were opportunities where the school's senior management team could have elevated these informal concerns to the local authority's child protection officers.\n\"The fact that this did not take place is, of course, a matter of great concern.\"\nIn response, the school acknowledged \"the bravery of the former pupils who came forward\", adding: \"Brynteg School offers a full and unreserved apology to all who have been affected by this deeply distressing situation.\"\nMark Woods, now aged 50, said: \"He was evil. He conned a lot of people. He gave people an impression of what he was like, and he wasn't like that at all.\"\nDescribing his own experiences, Mark said: \"It changed from the dark room to store room. It was once a week, twice a week sometimes.\n\"The cleaner's store room, an old, disused toilet, really grubby stuff. Looking back, it makes you feel really sick.\"\nMark attended Brynteg from 1982 until 1989 and described it as feeling like \"an out-of-body experience\" when Hally first abused him in a photography dark room. \nHe added: \"The red light went on and I remember he put his arm around me and kissed me. I didn't know to react.\"\nMark described his passion for art and feeling \"trapped\" because he did not want to speak up and spoil that, but said he realises now that by keeping quiet he he had \"unwittingly signed a contract between us that allowed Clive to carry on the abuse\".\nHe said: \"I was a child and you didn't want to get in trouble with your teacher. You didn't want any of the repercussions and Clive Hally could get very angry... he had a special kind of fury.\"\nWhile Mark has now waived his right to anonymity, he and another former pupil, who was 13 at the time, described Hally's abuse to BBC Wales in June 2019.\nAfter Mark and the other complainant went to police, Hally was initially arrested and released on police bail.\nHowever, on the day he was due to answer bail - 18 May 2019 - he was found drowned at Cwmwernderi reservoir, near Maesteg.\nAt an inquest at Swansea Civic Centre, acting senior coroner Colin Phillips recorded a conclusion of suicide, adding: \"Mr Hally died as a result of deliberately entering the reservoir with the view to ending his life and he subsequently drowned.\"\nThe coroner said police had ruled out any third party involvement and that clothing \"left in an orderly fashion on the jetty\" showed a \"degree of forethought and planning\".\nBridgend council's investigation revealed allegations were first made in 2018 and 2019, with Hally admitting some of these when interviewed by police. \n\"But he took his own life while awaiting a decision from the Crown Prosecution Service on whether charges would be brought against him,\" a report added.\nThe local authority has no record of any complaints or safeguarding concerns ever being raised, which is why the independent investigation was launched, with an independent organisation commissioned to carry it out.\nMore than 100 documents were examined, 29 interviews took place and contact made with those identified as potential victims.\n\"On the balance of probability and based on the available evidence, the report concludes that prior to his retirement in 2011, Mr Hally abused and engaged in inappropriate behaviour with several male learners during the period 1980 to 2009,\" it says.\nWhile none of the staff from the time remain at the school, recommendations include fresh training for recognising signs of abuse, and ensuring staff \"remain vigilant and aware\" of their reporting responsibilities.\nIn response to the report, the school said: \"Determining why those concerns were not elevated further or taken forward more formally has been complicated by the fact that a significant period of time has now passed, and the individuals concerned are no longer employed at the school.\"\nIt said staff were working alongside council officials to ensure recommendations are \"implemented in full\".\n\"Childhood abuse has a devastating effect on the emotional well-being and mental health of survivors, and it is thanks to their tremendous courage that his abhorrent actions were ultimately revealed,\" the statement added.\n\"What Mr Hally did remains a matter of huge concern, great sadness and regret for all concerned.\n\"Brynteg School has always been a strong, caring, close-knit community, and we are resolved to do all that we can to prevent this from happening again.\"\nChildren's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: \"This is a very disturbing case and my heart goes out to the victims of this abuse, some of whom have lived with the impact of it for decades. \n\"It is troubling to learn that past school leaders did not act on concerns expressed by members of school staff. \n\"The independent investigation highlights that the abuse was ongoing and continued after the high-profile inquiry into another case by my predecessor, the Clywch Inquiry.\"\nShe said there was \"no excuse\" for concerns not to be acted upon, adding: \"Abuse of this nature is by its nature secretive and abusers use their power to groom and silence their victims. \n\"It is therefore vital that all of us follow up concerns we may have, however small they may seem.\"\nMs Holland said while it was clear \"concrete steps\" had been taken, she added: \"Culture change of this nature is an ongoing process and I will be maintaining contact with the local authority on this issue.\""

      "tags": "G7 summits,United States,G7,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden is heading to Switzerland for the final leg of his first official overseas trip.\nHis eight-day visit to Europe - which has included a G7 leaders' meeting in the UK, an audience with the Queen and his first Nato summit as president - concludes by meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva.\nMr Biden does not travel lightly. The US president has an array of speciality vehicles to help him move around in safety and comfort, on land and in the air. \nAnd none is more iconic than the presidential plane - Air Force One.\nThe aircraft landed at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk on Wednesday, where Mr Biden met US personnel stationed there before flying to Cornwall. \nAs the White House website explains, Air Force One is actually the air traffic control sign for any Air Force aircraft with the US president on board.\nBut for the most part the term is used to refer to the two famous white and blue planes - specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft - which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000.\nThe planes have advanced communications, avionics and defences - including protection against electromagnetic pulses and flares to throw off heat-seeking missiles - which mean they can function as an airborne, mobile command centre in case of an attack on the US. \nThey are also capable of refuelling in the air, meaning in theory the planes have unlimited range.\nInside, there is 4,000 sq feet (372 sq m) of floor space spread over three levels. Aside from a presidential suite, there are also medical facilities, food galleys, and space for advisers, Secret Service protection officers and journalists.\nFor short trips in the air, the president uses a helicopter - recognisable by its predominantly green body and white top.\nMarine One - again, not just one helicopter, but the name for any Marine Corps aircraft carrying the US president - usually refers to a VH-3D Sea King or a VH-60N White Hawk.\nDecoy versions of Marine One often fly alongside the president's helicopter. It is also usually accompanied in the air by escort aircraft, including the Osprey MV-22 - known as a \"Green Top\". \nUK readers may remember the tilt-rotor aircraft flying over London during former President Donald Trump's visit in 2018. They are capable of vertical take-off and landing, and are designed to combine the functions of a helicopter with the range of a turboprop aircraft.\nOnce on the ground, President Biden usually transfers from Air Force One or Marine One to Cadillac One - nicknamed The Beast.\nThe 5.5-metre-long (18ft) Beast can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including a fridge with blood matching the president's blood type, in case of an emergency.\nThe newest generation of the Beast debuted in 2018. Manufacturer General Motors and the Secret Service have not given much away about the car's specific security features. But reports suggest it weighs about nine tonnes (20,000lb), and has an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows. \nIt reportedly has tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, and the tyres are reinforced so the car can still move even with flat tyres. \nHowever for the Cornwall leg of this trip, the president has so far chosen to ditch The Beast, opting to use an SUV instead. \nSecret Service agents had already travelled to Cornwall to scout out the location of the G7 summit - looking for the best route through the narrow country lanes.\nFormer President Barack Obama's visit to Downing Street in 2009 became a viral hit after the presidential limousine struggled to turn in the famous street. The driver on another trip in 2016 was more successful.\nAccess is strictly controlled to Carbis Bay on Cornwall's north coast, where global leaders are gathering. \nThe world's seven largest so-called advanced economies take part in G7 summits. Aside from the US, this includes the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada. The EU is also represented. "

      "tags": "United Nations,Tigray crisis,Ethiopia",
      "text": "UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has said there is famine in northern Ethiopia after the release of a UN-backed analysis of the situation.\n\"There is famine now,\" he said, adding: \"This is going to get a lot worse.\"\nThe study found that 350,000 people were living in \"severe crisis\" in the war-torn Tigray region.\nTigray has been devastated by fighting between government forces and rebels, with 1.7 million people displaced since fighting began in November 2020.\nAccording to the assessment, the food situation in the region has reached the level of a \"catastrophe\", which it defines as starvation and death affecting small groups of people spread over large areas.\nThe UN's World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization and children's agency Unicef have all called for urgent action to address the crisis.\nThe analysis - or Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) as it is known - was not endorsed by Ethiopia's government, which has denied that there is a famine in the country.\nIt insists that humanitarian access is being expanded as it restores order across the region.\nPeople in Qafta Humera, an isolated district in the west of Tigray, told the BBC this week they were on the verge of starvation.\n\"We don't have anything to eat,\" one man said by phone, explaining their crops and livestock had been looted during seven months of war.\nThey were being prevented from seeking aid by a militia fighting with government forces, he added.\n\"We were eating small remains of crops that we managed to hide, but now we don't have anything,\" said a farmer in his 40s.\n\"Nobody has given us any aid. Almost everyone is on the verge of death - our eyes are affected by the hunger, the situation is perilous. Death is knocking on our door. You can see the hunger on the face of each of us.\"\nResidents said they had seen vehicles carrying aid pass by, but no-one had bothered to inquire about their predicament.\nIn 1984, Tigray and the next-door province of Wollo were the epicentre of a famine caused by a combination of drought and war that led to between 600,000 and one million deaths.\nThe Integrated Phase Classification is a measure of the severity of food shortages, drawn up by multiple organisations which include UN agencies and non-governmental aid organisations. \n\"An IPC analysis update conducted in Tigray and the neighbouring zones of Amhara and Afar concludes that over 350,000 people are in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) between May and June 2021,\" the report says.\n\"This severe crisis results from the cascading effects of conflict, including population displacements, movement restrictions, limited humanitarian access, loss of harvest and livelihood assets, and dysfunctional or non-existent markets,\" the analysis adds. \nIt says that as of May, 5.5 million people were facing high levels of acute food insecurity in the region and the situation was likely to worsen through to September.\nBut the report stops short of officially declaring a famine, which has a very specific definition. \nThe IPC announcement falls short of declaring a famine in Tigray. That is because the \"f-word\" is such a powerful, compelling word that governments and international organisations have agreed it should only be used when certain strict criteria are met. \nFor now, the IPC has settled on the use of the word \"catastrophe\" instead - with a warning that large parts of Tigray are at risk of famine in the coming months. \nPut simply, a \"Phase 5 catastrophe\" can refer to small groups of people, spread over large areas, whereas the word \"famine\" is only used when a big and distinct population group is experiencing conditions of starvation and death. And right now, in Tigray - in part because of insecurity and problems accessing those in most need - there is not yet the data to support a definition of famine.\nBut many experts find this - often highly politicised - debate over definitions both petty and counter-productive, and individuals, like the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, have chosen to ignore the rules and insist that \"there is famine now in Tigray\". \nLast November Ethiopia's government launched an offensive to oust the region's then ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).\nThe party had had a massive fallout with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed over political changes to the country's ethnically based federal system - though the TPLF's capture of federal military bases in Tigray was the catalyst for the invasion.\nMr Abiy, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, declared that the conflict was over at the end of November, but fighting has continued.\nThousands of people have been killed. Tens of thousands have sought refuge in neighbouring Sudan.\nAll sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses.\nFood shortages can lead to large numbers of people lacking nutrition, but only rarely do they amount to famine, according to UN humanitarian criteria.\nLong periods of drought and other problems reducing the supply of food do not necessarily result in a famine.\nA famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. They are:\nThe declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or member states, but serves to focus global attention on the problem.\nSource: UN"

      "tags": "Ellon,Companies,BrewDog",
      "text": "A co-founder of Brewdog has promised to listen and learn from savage criticism of the beer company by 60 ex-staff.\nJames Watt told the BBC claims of a \"culture of fear\" and \"toxic attitude\" were tough to hear, but said they would help make him a better chief executive.\nIn an open letter, signatories said a \"significant number\" of former staff had \"suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog\".\nAnd they aren't happy with the apology, saying: \"We aren't going away\".\nMr Watt said it was clear some things had gone wrong at the company. \"We genuinely apologise,\" he said.\nBut the signatories have focused on a separate comment appearing to come from Mr Watt on Thursday, which they say illustrates his \"true disregard\" for his staff.\nIn the first letter, the ex-staff claimed that the firm was built around a \"cult of personality\" of founders Mr Watt and Martin Dickie.\nThe fast-growing Scottish brewer and pub chain has enjoyed rapid success and now employs 2,000 staff. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions. \nThe letter, posted on Twitter, made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.\nIt said Mr Watt and Mr Dickie had exploited publicity, \"both good and bad\", to further their own business goals and chased \"growth, at all costs\".\nIt added: \"You spent years claiming you wanted to be the best employer in the world, presumably to help you to recruit top talent, but ask former staff what they think of those claims, and you'll most likely be laughed at. \n\"Being treated like a human being was sadly not always a given for those working at Brewdog.\"\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Watt said: \"It's very clear, looking at the feedback, we haven't always got things right here.\n\"We have to see this feedback as an opportunity to get better. We have to learn, we have to act. We have to take it on the chin.\"\nMr Watt would not confirm if the allegations were true, but said: \"For me, it's not about disputing individual claims. But 60 people were unhappy and we have to get better. That's the only way we can get something good out of this situation.\"\nOne of the many criticisms was that Brewdog management operated a culture of fear, with staff afraid to speak out - even after they had left.\nThat culture has not prevented dozens more former Brewdog staff speaking up in response to the publicity around the letter. The letter now has more than 250 signatories, its unnamed authors said.\nThey have issued a follow-up letter, addressed to Mr Watt, in which they thank him for his apology but say that they have gathered many further examples of bad practice at the company. \nThey also voiced strong objections to an earlier message that was circulated to current Brewdog staff as an immediate reaction to their first letter of complaint.\nThat note, from James Watt, said: \"It is fair to say that this type of fast-paced and intense environment is definitely not for everyone, but many of our fantastic long-term team members have thrived in our culture. Our culture is built on rewarding and developing great people and focussing on growing our business.\"\nThe group of ex-staff said: \"We want you to know that we categorically refute everything suggested in this statement.\n\"Many of our signatories worked for Brewdog for years, and were extremely high-performing. To suggest that those who apparently couldn't hack it are somehow less worthy in your eyes is grotesque; we believe this shows your true feelings of disregard for your staff, both former and current.\"\nThe group said it would continue to monitor what action was taken to address these issues.\nIn his BBC interview Mr Watt admitted that the company's rapid growth had been a steep learning curve. \"But the buck stops with me. I will use [the criticism] to be a better chief executive and leader.\"\nHe said the company will embark on a series of anonymous surveys of current staff \"and do some listening groups\".\nHowever, Brewdog's rapid expansion - the source of much of the problems, ex-staff claim - would continue, he said: \"It's not about slowing the growth, because that's in our DNA.\"\nThe challenge now would be how Brewdog can maintain the intensity of its expansion, \"yet be a better employer,\" he said.\nBrewdog started out in 2007, being passionate about craft beer and contemptuous of rival big brewers. It's become at least as passionate about growth, by unconventional \"punk\" means. \nSo far, there is a big brewery in Aberdeenshire, plus others in Berlin, Brisbane and Columbus, Ohio. There are more than 100 Brewdog bars dotted across the world map. And a new project is beer-themed hotels, in Ohio, Manchester and Edinburgh.\nThis has been funded through the sale of a big chunk of the business to private equity and several rounds of crowdfunding. The AGM in Aberdeen has become something of a party.\nBut it seems the combined publicity-thirsty passion for beer and growth has been bruising. Every employer has disgruntled ex-employees. Usually, once dispersed, they moan into their beer. But in this case, these ex-staff signatories have taken their passion for beer and applied it to improving working conditions in their industry.\nCo-founder James Watt concedes he didn't always \"get things right\". He dispensed with the usual combative defiance. His response is chastened, recognising that the accusations could be damaging to the brand and to recruitment. \nHe has become very successful by inviting drinkers to buy into products infused with the passion of beer people. So this runs counter to the values of clubby comradeship. Repairing the damage will take more nuance than Brewdog usually deploys."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings has made a series of explosive claims about mistakes made by the government during the Covid pandemic.\nDuring a seven-hour joint session of the Commons Heath, and Science and Technology committees, Mr Cummings made a number of allegations - here are the key points.\n\"Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die,\" Mr Cummings said.\nEarlier, he said sorry for ministers, officials and advisers \"like me\" for falling \"disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect\".\n\"When the public needed us most the government failed,\" he added, apologising to \"the families of those who died unnecessarily\".\nMr Cummings said the government was not on a \"war footing\" when the virus emerged in January and February last year and \"lots of key people were literally skiing\".\nMr Cummings made a series of allegations against his former boss Boris Johnson, including:\nDescribing a decline in his relationship with Mr Johnson after the summer of 2020, he said \"it was clear in July that our relations were very far from where they had been\".\nHe added: \"They took another terrible dive after the second lockdown in October because the prime minister knew that I blamed him for the whole situation - and I did - and by 31 October our relations were essentially already finished... \n\"The heart of the problem was, fundamentally, I regarded him as unfit for the job. And I was trying to create a structure around him to try and stop what I thought would have been bad decisions, and push things through against his wishes.\"\nAsked later by Labour MP Sarah Owen whether Boris Johnson was a \"fit and proper person to get us through this pandemic\", Mr Cummings replied: \"No.\"\nDowning Street rejected many of the remarks and Mr Johnson insisted his government at \"every stage tried to minimise loss of life\".\nMr Cummings appeared to reserve his harshest criticism for Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\nMr Hancock \"should have been fired for at least 15 to 20 things\", Mr Cummings said, as he alleged the health secretary:\nA spokesman for Mr Hancock later said: \"We absolutely reject Mr Cummings' claims about the health secretary.\"\nMr Hancock added he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence to MPs in full \"and instead I've been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-30s, and saving lives\".\nHe said he would make a statement in the Commons on Thursday when he would \"have more to say\".\nMr Cummings said it was \"obvious\" in retrospect that the UK should have locked down in the first week of March at the latest - and it was a \"huge failure\" on his part not to alert the prime minister.\n\"I bitterly regret that I didn't hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did,\" he added.\nMr Cummings said that, on 14 March, Boris Johnson had been told that models showing the peak of infections was \"weeks and weeks and weeks away\" in June were \"completely wrong\".\nMr Cummings said that meeting came after the then deputy cabinet secretary, Helen MacNamara, relayed concerns that there was \"no plan... we're in huge trouble\".\nHe said the PM was warned: \"The NHS is going to be smashed in weeks. Really we've got days to act.\"\nMr Johnson announced a national lockdown nine days later on the evening of 23 March.\nMr Cummings painted a vivid picture of the chaotic atmosphere in Downing Street on one \"crazy\" day in March 2020 when the government was considering a national lockdown - at the same time as officials considered a bombing campaign in Iraq.\nOne morning, he claimed, the \"national security people came in\" and said \"[US President Donald] Trump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonight\" and this \"totally derailed\" meetings about quarantine and the coronavirus.\nAt the same time, he said, \"the prime minister's girlfriend was going completely crackers\" over a story in Times newspaper with the headline \"Downing St dog to be reshuffled\".\nThe article reported a Whitehall source as saying they were not sure Carrie Symonds' dog Dilyn would \"make it through the next reshuffle\" due to the mess he had created in her and Mr Johnson's No 11 flat.\nMr Cummings said: \"So, we have this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying, 'are we going to bomb Iraq?', part of the building was arguing about whether or not we're going to do quarantine or not do quarantine, the prime minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial.\"\nMr Cummings said that, as late as 12 March last year, the UK's top civil servant championed a plan of rapid herd immunity involving \"chicken pox parties\" for the virus.\nThen cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill is alleged to have suggested to Mr Johnson: \"Prime minister, you should go on TV tomorrow and explain the herd immunity plan and that it is like the old chicken pox parties. We need people to get this disease because that's how we get herd immunity by September.\"\nBut Mr Cummings said he told him not to use the analogy, which was \"not right\", as - according to data expert Ben Warner - Covid was \"spreading exponentially and killing hundreds of thousands of people\".\nAsked about more recent decisions over a second lockdown in the autumn of 2020, Mr Cummings alleged Mr Johnson rejected a recommendation last September for a shorter stay-at-home order in England.\n\"He was ignoring the advice,\" he added, saying the prime minister believed he had been pushed into imposing the first one and that the economic harm done by lockdown would be worse than Covid itself.\nHe added: \"All credible serious people in my opinion were saying essentially the same thing so I was very, very clear with him about it.\n\"He wasn't taking any advice, he was just making his own decisions, he was going to ignore the advice. Cabinet wasn't involved or asked.\n\"I've been very critical of Matt Hancock but I think Hancock agreed with me actually in September about acting then.\""

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "A court in Moscow has banned political organisations linked to the jailed Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny, classifying them as \"extremist\".\nActivists will risk prison sentences if they continue their work and anyone who publicly supports Mr Navalny's political network can now be barred from running for public office. \nWriting on social media, Mr Navalny promised he would \"not retreat\".\nHowever, he said his supporters would now have to change how they work.\nMr Navalny is in prison for violating the terms of parole in an embezzlement case - charges he says are politically motivated.\nRussian parliamentary elections are due to take place in September and opinion polls show the ruling party losing support. Some of Mr Navalny's supporters have been planning to run in the elections.\nFollowing Wednesday's ruling, a court statement said Mr Navalny's regional network offices and his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) had been banned with immediate effect.\n\"It was found that these organisations not only disseminated information that incited hatred and enmity against government officials, but also committed extremist actions,\" prosecutors' spokesman Alexei Zhafyarov said outside the court.\nMr Navalny's lawyers said they would appeal against the ruling.\nA message later posted on Mr Navalny's Instagram account said: \"We're not going anywhere. We'll digest this, sort things out, change, and evolve. We'll adapt. We won't step back from our aims and ideas. This is our country and we do not have another one.\"\nThe \"extremist\" label could have serious consequences for supporters of Alexei Navalny and his political movement. Activists can be threatened with jail if they continue their work and individuals linked to or publicly supporting Mr Navalny's political network can be barred from running for public office. \nAnd it just so happens that there is an election coming up in Russia: for parliament, in three months' time. The Russian authorities are going to extraordinary lengths to prevent opponents from taking part in it. A major crackdown on dissent is under way. Just a few days ago, a prominent Kremlin critic Dmitry Gudkov left the country, he says under pressure from the authorities. \nWhy is the Kremlin so nervous? After all, President Putin's supporters enjoy pointing out that, according to opinion polls, Alexei Navalny has minimal support amongst the Russian public. \nWhat is happening reflects the level of fear and political paranoia in the corridors of power here. With the ruling party increasingly unpopular, the Kremlin may worry that, amid economic problems and with no end in sight to the Coronavirus pandemic, its opponents could do well at the ballot box. That is something the Russian authorities are determined to prevent.   \nMr Navalny - President Putin's foremost critic - was detained in January as soon as he returned to Russia from Germany. He had received treatment in Berlin for a nerve agent attack in Siberia last August that left him in a coma and fighting for his life.\nMr Navalny blamed President Putin directly for the attack which nearly killed him. The Kremlin denied any involvement.\nThe pro-Putin United Russia party, which dominates parliament, has been described by the opposition leader as \"the party of crooks and thieves\", and millions of Russians have watched his videos alleging corruption in Mr Putin's elite circle.\nMr Navalny is expected to be a topic on the agenda of talks between Mr Putin and US President Joe Biden at their first summit on 16 June.\nMr Putin, who has been in power as either president or prime minister since 1999, recently said he hoped the Geneva meeting would improve the \"extremely low level of relations\" between the two countries but expected no breakthroughs."

      "text": "The number of undocumented migrants reaching the US-Mexico border has hit the highest level in more than 20 years in the latest sign of the humanitarian crisis facing the Biden administration.\nUS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it caught 180,034 migrants, mostly single adults, in May. \nThe number was up slightly from 178,854 in April and 172,000 in March.\nIt was the biggest monthly total since April 2000 with increasing numbers coming from outside Central America. \nThis includes countries like Ecuador, Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and even some African nations. \nThe number of unaccompanied children from Central America dropped to 10,765 in May, compared with 13,940 the previous month, according to CBP figures.\nThe agency said that of the 180,034 people encountered in May, 112,302 individuals were expelled under a Trump-era policy known as Title 42, which was kept in place by US President Joe Biden. \nThe border agency said the average daily number of children in its custody has plummeted to 640. However, another 16,200 migrant children are being held by the US health department.\nSome of these children have no relatives in the US, Health Secretary Xavier Becerra said on Tuesday in congressional testimony.\nJooYeun Chang, a US health department acting assistant secretary, said the numbers of unaccompanied migrant children since March are \"simply unprecedented\".\nThe CBP update follows US Vice-President Kamala Harris' two-day visit to Guatemala and Mexico to address the root causes of immigration. She told illegal immigrants thinking of making the trek to America: \"Do not come.\"\nHarris under pressure to visit US-Mexico border\nAccording to CNN, the White House was \"not thrilled\" by Ms Harris' testy exchange during the trip with a TV news anchor, who asked her why she had not herself visited the US-Mexico border.\nThe cable network's White House correspondent John Harwood said the vice-president's \"obvious discomfort\" with the question by NBC and her \"nervous laughter\" had left the White House \"confused\".\nAcross the northern border, Canada has offered to help with the crisis by taking in some Central American migrants.\nCanada's immigration minister Mark Mendicino told Reuters on Tuesday: \"I certainly think that we have the capacity.\" \nCanada has pledged to resettle thousands of refugees in 2021, but it also turned away those seeking asylum during the pandemic. It remains unclear how the country will accept migrants who are currently in US custody.\nMr Biden campaigned on the promise of a more humane immigration agenda. Since coming into office, the Democratic president has ended construction of the border wall and repealed Mr Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, which required US asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications were processed. \nHe has also urged Congress to create a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the US.\nA recent Biden administration memo requires US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to seek authorisation from senior managers before seeking to deport certain migrants, according to the Washington Post, a policy that the newspaper predicted would result in a steep decline in immigration arrests and deportations.\nRepublicans have blamed Mr Biden's policies for the border surge, and so did Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, on the eve of his meeting with the US vice-president.\nHe told CBS News on Sunday that after Mr Biden took office \"the very next day the coyotes were here organising groups of children to take them to the United States\"."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Recorded Covid infections among children are now the highest they have been during the outbreak in Scotland.\nWeekly infections in 0-14 year olds reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland.\nWhile there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill, growing numbers of pupils are off school.\nNicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the regulator.\nThe number of cases among the youngest age group is rising rapidly, having seen a near four-fold increase since early May.\nDespite the rise, medics have said children's wards are not seeing any significant rise in admissions due to Covid and said there is no reason for parents to worry.\nHowever, a number of schools have had to shut temporarily because of pupils testing positive, with St Peter's Primary in Galashiels among the latest to announce a short closure to allow contact tracing. \nWhile most schools are open, growing numbers of pupils have been asked to stay home because they are possible contacts of pupils who have tested positive.\nProvisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%, the lowest percentage since pupils returned after Easter. \nChildren under the age of 15 represent about quarter of the daily case numbers in recent weeks in terms of total numbers.\nHowever, when the size of the population in each age group is factored in, it is clear that infection rates are considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. \nOn 7 June, the weekly case rate among people in their early 20s was 277.2 per 100,000.\nOlder teenagers had the second highest rate, at 228.4, while for younger children it was 122.9.\nWhat is clear from the data is that infections among older age groups are relatively low during the latest outbreaks, possibly a reflection of the rollout of the vaccination programme.\nMore than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine.\nThe UK regulator has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15.\nThe Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)  on whether it should begin vaccinating children.\nOn Tuesday the first minister said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated but if the JCVI recommends vaccination of children, she said Scotland would \"move as quickly as possible to implement the advice\".\nScottish government adviser Prof Devi Sridhar has backed the rollout of the vaccine to those over the age of 12.\nSpeaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, she said: \"If we want schools to continue without disruption in the autumn and lift restrictions so children can have a normal experience, we need to vaccinate them \u2014 if we wait and watch for the evidence it will be too late in the next few weeks.\n\"We have the supply. It's not a large amount, it's a couple of million doses to cover that population of 12-plus.\n\"Given that we know children can transmit, where we are going to see problems is not going to be in care homes, it's not going to be in hospitals, it's going to be in schools.\"\nAnother leading health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, has said she \"really welcomed\" plans to vaccinate teenagers but said completing the adult age groups must come first. \nShe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"They will be next in line after we have issued vaccinations to all the 18-29 year olds, as Wales has already done. I really welcome the vaccine programme for teenagers... it will make a difference but they will not be able to receive it until older groups have. \n\"Over two million teenagers in the US have already received the vaccine, the trials suggest it's safe, so let's hope this all goes well.\" \nWith world leaders facing calls to do more to share vaccines internationally, some have argued a greater priority should be driving down infections globally, which could be the source of new variants. \nChristine Tait-Burkhard, an infection expert from University of Edinburgh, said it was a complex issue because while vaccination might help school attendance, there is little evidence of children becoming seriously ill. \nShe told Drivetime with John Beattie: \"The last question is an ethical one. If we are starting to vaccinate children in this country yet other countries haven't got any vaccines or very little vaccines to vaccinate their most vulnerable.\n\"It is not only an ethical question, it's also a message that it sends to the world that says we don't care.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has said that if enough immunity was built up through the adult vaccination programme then vaccinating children may not be justified.\nHe said: \"The issue is not that there's a problem doing it, it's just a question of whether we need to do it, given the very low incidence of serious illness in children and the fact that we're achieving so much with the adult programme at the moment with very high coverage.\n\"If indeed it turns out that children can be indirectly protected by the immunity that we induce in adults then there's clearly no justification for immunising - or at least immunising all of them.\" "

But are they here for the man himself, or the aircraft that will bring him in?\nTracy Williams and her daughter Vanessa have been setting up their gazebo at The Nook Campsite in Mildenhall each day for three days straight.\nBut the pair, from Soham, Cambridgeshire, are not here to camp. They are here to see aircraft.\nAnd the president is due to arrive at Mildenhall on Wednesday evening, ahead of the G7 Summit which starts on Friday at Carbis Bay, Cornwall.\nThe Suffolk airbase will be the first place outside the United States that Joe Biden has visited since becoming president following his election victory over Donald Trump last November.\n\"It has been very busy for the past three days, seeing the [Lockheed] C-5 Galaxy and the [Boeing] C-17 Globemaster, it has been brilliant,\" says Mrs Williams. \"It is just, the size of it, how it gets off the floor is amazing. \n\"We've been doing it for years since the kids were little.\"\nAnd as for the arrival of the US President?\n\"That will be really great,\" says Mrs Williams.\nBut it is the chance to see Air Force One that she is especially excited about it.\nThe presidential fleet includes two identical jets, and whichever one the president is aboard is given the signal name Air Force One.\nThe current Boeing 747s have been in use for nearly three decades. The 4,000 sq/ft (1,220 sq/m) aircraft features three floors, armoured windows, medical offices and a kitchen that can feed 100 people at a time. A new version is expected to come into service in 2024.\n\"It is a once-in-a-lifetime type of thing. It is going to be great,\" says Mrs Williams.\n\"I've been coming over here since I was nine years old,\" says daughter Vanessa Hale, who has brought her own two-year-old girl Ricci-Leigh. \"It is amazing, it is in my blood.\n\"Now I've got a two-year-old and she is amazed by everything. I love it.\n\"I am really looking forward to seeing Air Force One come in and sitting on the base. \n\"It will be the first time I remember seeing it up close and personal. I've waited years for this.\"\nBut Mrs Williams and family have only come from just over the border in Cambridgeshire.\nPaul Darlow has travelled up all the way from Devon and has met up with his parents John and Janet Darlow, who have joined him at Mildenhall from Wiltshire.\nFor them too, the interest is more in the aircraft than the president himself.\n\"It keeps my husband happy and he loves the aircraft,\" says Mrs Darlow.\n\"We come together to sit read and watch the aircraft.\n\"It is a once-in-a-lifetime to see Air Force One and the other aircraft that go with it.\"\nAs for the senior Mr Darlow, there is a tinge of disappointment about the Biden visit.\n\"I would prefer to have seen his helicopter,\" he says, \"but it doesn't sound like that is going to happen.\n\"We are hopefully going to see the flying command post that flies with him [Joe Biden]. \n\"For me, that will be the star of the arrivals. There will probably some other VIP aircraft flying too.\"\nWhile it will not be Mr Darlow's first experience of Air Force One and its aerial entourage - he has seen them before at Fairford, Gloucestershire - this will be the first time \"in recent years\".\n\"It is a bit special,\" he says. \"I grew up just after the war and we were surrounded by military bases and there was aircraft everywhere, and I suppose [my interest] just grew from there.\n\"I really like the US Navy stuff that lands on carriers. I don't think I could pick out a favourite aircraft.\"\nAs for Mr Darlow (junior), he has come for what he describes as \"a free air show without all the crowds and the hassle\".\n\"I had nothing on, the sun is shining and its a unique opportunity to see some unusual planes,\" he says. \n\"The jumbo [Air Force One] is a nice aircraft but it is the stuff that accompanies him that is more interesting, such as the command post, like my dad says.\n\"I was taken with plane spotting when I was growing up. We used to do a lot of air shows. It is nice to pick it up again with my parents. Mildenhall is a wonderful place.\"\nWhat does the presidential visit mean for the town itself?\n\"We are very excited here in Mildenhall,\" says the mayor of Mildenhall Jane Busuttil.\n\"There's a huge buzz in the town about receiving the president of the United States and the First Lady, Dr Jill Biden.\n\"There's real excitement to have the president visit and perhaps stop over possibly on his way over to Newquay for the G7 Summit.\n\"It is a great opportunity for the president to meet the personnel and their families.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The lesions can cause scarring.\nThe infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.\nMost cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks.\nMonkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, and has been reported to have caused deaths in west Africa.\nSources: PHE England and World Health Organization"

The modern agreement, based on a declaration during World War Two, will focus on a number of challenges including a way of relaunching travel between the two countries \"as soon as possible\", a No 10 statement said. Almost all passengers from the UK are currently banned from travelling to the US. However, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, Shai Weiss, said the announcement, which sees a new taskforce being created to make recommendations on easing travel, \"falls short\".\nMatt Hancock will address a number of accusations levelled against him over the government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic when he answers questions from MPs later. It comes after the prime minister\u2019s former adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the health secretary should have been fired on several occasions for \u201clying\u201d to the cabinet during the crisis. Mr Hancock denies the claims, saying he has been guided by science throughout.\nThere are still \"serious problems\" among private Covid testing firms, with rogue operators making misleading claims, says consumer group Which?

      "text": "More than 90 schools in Wales have been named on a website where girls have shared allegations of sexual harassment or abuse.\nA review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges in England concluded sexual harassment had become \"normalised\" among school-age children.\nThe Welsh Conservatives called on the Welsh government to find out the scale of the problem in schools across Wales.\nEducation Minister Jeremy Miles said the issue was a priority.\nUK ministers asked English schools inspectorate Ofsted to begin a review in England after the Everyone's Invited website began publishing anonymous testimony of sexual abuse allegations in schools.\nIt also launched a helpline run by the NSPCC.\nSchools in Wales are the responsibility of the Welsh government.\nLaura Anne Jones, education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives, called on ministers in Wales to act after the \"troubling references to 91 schools in Wales\" by asking its own schools watchdog to investigate.\nShe said: \"It's vital the Welsh government now instructs Estyn to look at the prevalence of the problem in Wales, assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges, and publish its findings.\n\"Schools must be a safe place for our children.\"\nMr Miles told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Ginio the issue \"is a priority for us here in Wales too\".\nAsked if he would commit to an inquiry by Estyn, the minister replied: \"We are looking at the best way to respond to this.\n\"We want to make sure we take deliberate steps to ensure this doesn't happen.\"\nMr Miles said the Welsh government would say more \"in due course\".\nThe Ofsted report, which questioned 900 staff and pupils in 30 schools and colleges in England, found more than two-thirds of girls said they endured unwanted touching \"a lot\" or \"sometimes\", while eight in 10 said they had been put under pressure to share sexual images of themselves.\nThe report said data on children sexually harassing or abusing other children was scarce, saying: \"It is hard to get an accurate picture of the scale and nature of sexual harassment and violence between children and young people in schools and colleges.\n\"Although anyone can experience sexual harassment and violence, research indicates that girls are disproportionately affected,\" the report said. \n\"For example, 90% of recorded offences of rape in 2018-19 of 13 to 15-year-olds were committed against girls. In the past year, girls aged between 15 and 17 reported the highest annual rates of sexual abuse for young people and children aged 25 and younger.\"\nThe report was prompted by the Everyone's Invited website, which has attracted more than 16,000 posts.\nIt publishes anonymous allegations which mostly refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university.\nWales' children's commissioner Professor Sally Holland said: \"Whilst I would welcome Estyn's expertise in gathering more information about this, we already know that this is an issue here in Wales.\n\"I've been hearing harrowing experiences from children and young people for years - which we've dealt with as individual cases - and I wouldn't want to delay taking action on this now by having to wait for a review.\"\nShe called for government to make a \"wider package of support and resources\" available, with \"high quality professional learning that gives all teachers the understanding and skills needed to prevent sexual harassment\"."

      "text": "Travel industry figures have dismissed the latest moves by the US and UK to reopen travel.\nA new taskforce will be set up to make recommendations on easing restrictions as part of an \"Atlantic Charter\", set to be agreed on Thursday.\nA Number 10 statement said the prime minister and president would \"work to relaunch UK-US travel as soon as possible\".\nBut the boss of Virgin Atlantic said the announcement \"falls short\".\nChief executive Shai Weiss said: \"The creation of the Atlantic Taskforce is positive recognition of the importance of the UK-US travel corridor and a first step towards reopening the skies.\"\nBut he said the lack of a specific time frame for reopening travel meant airlines, businesses and passengers faced a lack of certainty.\nAhead of the start of the G7 summit in Cornwall, Mr Weiss urged Mr Biden and Mr Johnson to allow trans-Atlantic travel no later than 4 July.\nNearly all passengers from the UK are currently banned from travelling to the US.\nUnder a presidential decree introduced last March, non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days cannot enter the country unless a specific exemption applies.\nMeanwhile, travellers from the US to the UK must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival as the country is on the \"amber list\".\nRead more on restrictions when travelling to Amber list countries here.\nClive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, also called for a firm commitment on a date.\n\"We welcome the formation of the Atlantic Charter 2021 as a step in the right direction for transatlantic travel. \n\"However, this is the latest in a long line of travel taskforces which so far have only wreaked further devastation on our industry. Jobs won't be saved, nor livelihoods protected, until we are given a certainty on dates for the resumption of international travel.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Association of British Travel Agents said that \"steps to get travel restarted are very welcome\". But she also pointed out the lack of detail in the announcement.\nShe added: \"Consideration should also be given to capitalising on the success of the UK vaccine rollout by relaxing rules for fully vaccinated individuals when travelling between low-risk areas, as the US, and many other countries, are already doing.\"\nThe taskforce will be overseen in the UK by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and will be chaired by senior officials in the US and UK.\nIt will \"work to explore options for resuming US-UK travel and ensure that the UK and US closely share thinking and expertise on international travel policy going forward\", Downing Street said in a statement.\nIt added: \"Links between the UK and US are not only crucial for our people, they create and sustain jobs across and throughout our two countries.\"\nIn a letter calling for trans-Atlantic travel to reopen on Monday, airline bosses and Heathrow Airport estimated that UK businesses are losing \u00a323m each day that the route remains closed.\nBoris Johnson and Joe Biden will also agree to work together on issues such as the post-pandemic recovery, climate change and security as part of Atlantic Charter, which is expected to be agreed when they meet on Thursday in Cornwall.\nThe original Atlantic Charter was a joint statement made by Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt in 1941, setting out joint goals in the wake of the Second World War."

      "text": "A mum and her three children died when she steered her car on to the wrong side of the road and crashed head-on with a lorry, an inquest has heard.\nThe crash on the A40 in Oxfordshire caused the deaths of Zoe Powell, 29, and her children Phoebe, eight, Simeon, six, and four-year-old Amelia. \nMrs Powell's husband Josh and their daughter Penny, who was 18 months old, survived the crash on 12 October 2020. \nA coroner said fatigue and distraction may have caused her to swerve the car.\nMrs Powell was driving the family home from her in-laws' house when the collision with the 36-tonne lorry happened near a railway bridge at 21:50 BST, Oxfordshire Coroner's Court heard. \nHer Subaru people carrier was fitted with an onboard computer, which showed it had been in cruise control and was steered sharply to the right moments before the collision. \nWitnesses reported the car had been driving normally and within the 60mph speed limit immediately before the crash. \nLorry driver Adao Patricio, who suffered only minor injuries, said he had no time to react to the car crossing into his path. \nThe court was told Mr Powell, who had been in the passenger seat, had no recollection of the crash and so it could not be known for certain what caused his wife to swerve. \nDarren Salter, Oxfordshire's head coroner, said he had considered whether Mrs Powell had been fatigued or asleep, distracted by the children in the backseat, or if it was a deliberate act. \nHe said although the possibility of it being deliberate could not be ruled out, there was no evidence she had ever considered harming herself or her children. \n\"I think it is more likely that there was fatigue or distraction, or a combination of the two,\" the coroner said. \nHe added that Mrs Powell, a writer and artist, had been described as \"devoted to her children, marriage and faith\". \nA conclusion of death by road traffic collision was recorded. \nIn a statement released following the hearing the family said: \"Whilst there is much that we will never fully understand about the crash, it is helpful to comprehend some of the potential explanations of what led to it.\n\"The possibility that such a small distraction may have caused such a horrific accident should act as a painful reminder for everyone that roads are dangerous places; the actions of a single moment have wrecked an entire family and had a lasting impact on everyone around them.\"\nThe family added that Mrs Powell, Phoebe, Simeon and Amelia had left them with \"an abundance of happy memories\" and they were now taking comfort from their faith in Christianity. \nThe deaths occurred just months after the family lost everything in a fire at their home.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Boris Johnson has described US President Joe Biden as a \"breath of fresh air\" after they met for the first time on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall.\n\"There's so much that they want to do together with us, from security, NATO, to climate change,\" Mr Johnson said.\nHe also said there was \"complete harmony\" with Mr Biden over Northern Ireland.\nThe US, UK and EU all want to protect the Good Friday Agreement, the PM said. \nIt comes after Mr Biden had earlier warned that the UK-EU dispute over border controls should not risk the peace process in Northern Ireland.\nThe Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998, helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\nMr Johnson said he was \"optimistic\" the peace process would be kept going and that there is \"absolutely common ground\" on the issue between the two leaders. \nDuring their meeting, the two men also established a taskforce to re-establish travel across the Atlantic, after the US banned most British people from entering at the start of the pandemic.\nAnd they agreed a deal - labelled the \"Atlantic Charter\" - which commits the two countries to work together on global challenges.\nMr Johnson said: \"It's incredibly important that we should affirm that [relationship] and the talks were great, they went on for a long time, we covered a huge range of subjects, and it's wonderful to listen to the Biden administration and to Joe Biden.\"\nMr Biden said the \"Atlantic Charter\" would address the \"key challenges of this century - cyber security, emerging technologies, global health and climate change\".\n\"We affirmed the special relationship - that is not said lightly - the special relationship between our people and renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share,\" he added.\nEarlier, the leaders posed for photographs with their wives and the four exchanged gifts, with keen cyclist Mr Johnson receiving a US-made bike and helmet. \nMr Johnson gave the president a photo of Frederick Douglass - a former slave who campaigned against slavery in the 19th Century - and a first edition of Daphne du Maurier's The Apple Tree, a collection of short stories, to First Lady Jill Biden.\nThe G7 summit begins on Friday and will be the first time world leaders have assembled in person since the coronavirus pandemic.\nThey will be joined by the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who will all attend the G7 leaders' reception on Friday evening. \nAfterwards, Prince Charles will host a reception for the G7 leaders and CEOs from the world's largest companies to discuss how the private sector can work with governments to tackle the climate emergency, with Prince William also attending.  \nCovid vaccines and climate change will be among the main issues on the G7 agenda. \nBut the on-going disagreement between the UK and the EU over post-Brexit regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from Great Britain also look set to feature heavily in diplomatic discussions.  \nThe arrangements were agreed in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal, but the UK has since sought more flexibility.\nAsked about the dispute on Thursday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"I think it's not serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December.\n\"We have a trade deal - it has been painfully discussed for years... if six months later, they say: 'What we negotiated with you, we don't know how to respect it', then that means that nothing is respectable anymore.\"\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the Northern Ireland protocol - the name for the post-Brexit trading rules - was the \"only solution\" and should be implemented fully.\nNorthern Ireland was given special status as a result of the 2019 Brexit \"divorce\" settlement between the UK and the EU.\nWhile England, Scotland and Wales no longer follow EU rules, Northern Ireland still does, because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nIn order to avoid a physical border between the two countries - and thereby protect the peace process - it was agreed that customs checks would take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK.\nBut unionists say this has effectively put a border down the Irish Sea instead - something they are ideologically opposed to - and business say supply chains have been complicated and disrupted. \nTalks on Wednesday between Brexit minister Lord Frost and the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to try to resolve the standoff ended without a breakthrough.\nSince becoming president, Mr Biden has frequently stressed the importance of the Good Friday Agreement, which was brokered by the US.\nAnd speaking before the summit, the president's national security adviser told the BBC that Mr Biden has \"deep\" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in the region.\nAsked if Mr Biden made his alarm about the situation in Northern Ireland clear, Mr Johnson replied: \"No, he didn't.\"\nBefore the meeting, Mrs Biden and Mrs Johnson joined their husbands in Cornwall for a walk in Carbis Bay.\nAdmiring the view, Mr Biden said: \"It's gorgeous - I don't want to go home.\"\nThe two women dipped their feet in the sea and later had tea together.\nDr Biden told reporters: \"It's really nice to be here in Cornwall. It's my first time. Obviously it's beautiful for those of you who have been here before.\"\nMr Biden suggested that both he and the prime minister had \"married way above our stations\" - something with which Mr Johnson agreed.\nThe prime minister married his partner Carrie in a low-key wedding in Westminster Cathedral, at the end of May."

      "text": "A convicted terrorist who was shot by police following the Fishmongers' Hall attack was lawfully killed, an inquest jury has found.\nUsman Khan fatally stabbed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones during a prisoner rehabilitation conference at the London venue on 29 November 2019.\nHe was chased from the hall on to London Bridge by three men, before being shot at 20 times by armed police.\nThe inquest heard police feared Khan might detonate a suicide belt.\nSix police officers from the Met and City of London fired 20 times at Khan, including 18 shots in a 90-second period. \nThey had been sanctioned to carry out a so-called \"critical shot\" amid fears he was about to detonate his device. It turned out to be a fake.\nTwelve of the 20 bullets hit Khan. A forensic pathologist gave the cause of death as haemorrhage due to multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen.\nThe post-mortem examination also showed several other injuries, including from a narwhal tusk taken from the wall of Fishmongers' Hall by those who tried to thwart Khan. \nOne tusk jab had nearly killed him, passing within a centimetre of the carotid artery and jugular vein, the inquest heard.\nThe first team of firearms officers from the City of London Police had arrived seconds after Khan was pursued out of Fishmongers' Hall to find a m\u00eal\u00e9e on London Bridge. As they tried to take control of Khan, he said to one of them: \"I've got a bomb.\"\nThe officer - named only as YX99 in the inquest to protect his identity - then realised Khan had some sort of belt with wires around his waist. As soon as he could do so safely, he opened fire twice.\n\"Literally the first second the shot became available, I took it,\" YX99 told the inquest, \"to save myself and to try and save the people around me.\"\nJurors at London's Guildhall concluded that Khan had been lawfully killed by anonymous police officers.\nThey were directed to return a short-form conclusion of lawful killing by coroner Mark Lucraft QC on the grounds that each of the officers who shot Khan believed it was necessary to do so to protect themselves and others.\nIn a longer, narrative conclusion, the jury said that when the police shot Khan dead, the officers \"believed he was trying to find a trigger\" on a suicide vest, and that when they opened fire, they feared Khan was moving to detonate the device.\nThe coroner Mark Lucraft QC praised the work of Ms Jones and Mr Merritt, whose lives were \"tragically cut short\" by Khan. The standard of first aid performed on the day could not be faulted, he added. \nHe further praised the efforts of the three people who showed \"great bravery\" in chasing Khan out of Fishmongers' Hall.\nKhan had been released 11 months before the killings despite being viewed as an \"influential\" inmate who mixed with high-profile terrorists.\nA Court of Appeal ruling meant Khan, from Stafford, had to be automatically released on licence from prison, with the Parole Board having no say as to whether he was safe to be freed.\nUpon his release, Khan was assessed as being more dangerous than when he went into prison, and there was seen to be an imminent risk of him causing serious harm to the public.\nMet Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said he would await the coroner's Prevention of Future Deaths report and praised the \"heroic\" speed and professionalism of his officers.\n\"But my final words are reserved for Jack and Saskia,\" he said. \"They were two wonderful and talented young people who already achieved so much in their lives, which were tragically cut short.\n\"My thoughts and the thoughts of everyone in policing are with the friends, families and loved ones of Jack and Saskia, and they are with everyone who was injured, traumatised or affected by this attack.\""

      "tags": "Colombo,Pollution,Ocean pollution,Shipping industry,Sri Lanka",
      "text": "Earlier last month, a cargo ship carrying chemicals caught fire off the coast of Sri Lanka - leaving in its wake an environmental disaster that the island will likely have to live with for decades. \nFor days it stood burning off the Sri Lanka coast, plumes of thick dark smoke that could be seen from miles away. But the X-Press Pearl has now fallen silent, lying half sunken off the coast of Sri Lanka, its hull resting on the shallow ocean bed.\nBut though the flames have now been doused - the problems have only just begun. \nOnboard the ship, there are still towers of containers stacked upon each other, many containing chemicals highly dangerous to the environment - some of these have already leaked into the water, sparking fears that it may poison marine life. \nAdditionally, tons of tiny plastic pellets have already washed up on local beaches nearby. And then there's the hundreds of tonnes of engine fuel sealed in the sunken hull that could also potentially leak into the sea. \nAside from the environmental threats, there are also devastating consequences for the local communities, fishermen who overnight lost their livelihoods and will likely suffer for years to come. \n\"We are small time fishermen and we go to sea daily. We can only earn something if we go to sea - otherwise our entire family will starve,\" one local fisherman, Denish Rodrigo, told the BBC.\nOne thing stands out when looking at photos of the disaster - tiny round pieces of plastic that stretch out almost as far as the eye can see. \nThese plastic pellets, also called nurdles, are used to make nearly all plastic goods.\n\"There were some 46 different chemicals on that ship,\" Hemantha Withanage, a Sri Lankan environmental activist and founder of the Centre for Environmental Justice in the capital Colombo, told the BBC. \n\"But what's been most visible so far are the tonnes of plastic pellets.\" \nSince late May, such pellets from the X-Press Pearl cargo have ended up on the Negombo beaches while fish have already been washed up with bloated bellies and pellets stuck in their gills. \nThe plastic can take between 500 to 1000 years to decompose and is likely to be carried by ocean currents to shores all around Sri Lanka and even to beaches hundreds of kilometres away from the shipwreck. \nYet while the plastic might be the most visible impact so far, it's not the most dangerous one. \n\"If these nurdles are within fish we eat, they're usually in the fish's digestive tract,\" Britta Denise Hardesty of Australia's CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere told the BBC. \"But we don't eat the entire fish unless it's maybe anchovies or sardines.\n\"Pellets are often sensationalised but there is no strong evidence that humans are shown to have detrimental impact from eating fish that may haven eaten plastics.\"\nBut for the fishermen of Negombo, their concern is not only what's inside the fish - but the possibility of not being able to catch any fish at all. \nFishing has now been banned in the affected area  - meaning that many of them have lost their income and livelihood practically overnight. \n\"The fish are bred in the coral reefs in the area and authorities are saying that all those breeding grounds are destroyed due to the dangerous chemicals. There is no other option than jump into the sea and die,\" says Tiuline Fernando, who's been a fisherman for the past 35 years.\nWhile the government is expecting compensation and insurance money from the Singapore-based owners of the ship, the locals aren't too optimistic that much of that money will be used to help them. \nHowever the fishermen's association told the BBC that they would desperately need help, both the fishermen and the wider community.\n\"It's not only us,\" explains Densil Fernando, the president of the group and a fisherman himself. \n\"There are other related industries that are also impacted by this. We buy nets and engines and boats, we need oil, there are people who pull the boats. There are thousands of other related jobs connected to this fishing industry.\"\nThe most long-lasting impact, likely to affect the country for decades, is that of chemical pollution. \nAmong the most dangerous elements on board the ship are nitric acid, sodium dioxide, copper and lead, says Mr Withanage.  \nOnce in the water, these chemicals make their way into the bellies of the local marine life. \nSmall fish might die quickly as a result of poisoning, but bigger ones are less likely to. Instead, feeding on smaller fish, the toxins will slowly build up in their bodies over time. \nMr Withange says fish, turtles and dolphins have already washed up dead on the beaches. Some of those had turned a greenish colour, suggesting contamination with metals and chemicals.\n\"So if in a few years you catch a tuna, it will still be contaminated - this bioaccumulation will be a serious problem.\"\nThis means fish from the area will be dangerous for humans - not just for now, but for years to come. \n\"People need to be educated on this,\" Mr Withange urges. \"It's a completely toxic ship now. Any litter coming to shore is very poisonous and people should not even touch it.\"\nThe problem is by no means limited to the immediate area around the shipwreck on Sri Lanka's western coast.  \n\"Wastes, toxins or plastics don't follow geographic boundaries,\" Britta Denise Hardesty of Australia's CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere told the BBC. \n\"They will be carried by wind, waves, currents and those things change seasonally.\"\nWhile there have been shipwrecks before, Sri Lanka has never faced one with such poisonous cargo -  and the country is not well prepared for a difficult job like this. \nActivists urge that international experts will be crucial. \nThe shipping company that owns the X-Press Pearl has already commissioned an international firm to respond to the crisis and says its specialists are on the ground in Sri Lanka. \nBut Mr Withanage doubts whether a profit-driven firm will really do its utmost to help the situation. The shipwreck has become a high-profile insurance case and the idea of a large pay out could very well trump the concern for marine life. \nThe Centre for Environmental Justice has sued both the Sri Lankan government and the shipping company over the situation, but the group acknowledges that the best outcome might just be that of raising awareness. \nFor now, Mr Withanage's biggest hope is that the disaster will at least be a valuable lesson to prevent another such disaster.

      "tags": "Medical research,Mosquitoes,Infection",
      "text": "Dengue fever cases have been cut by 77% in a \"groundbreaking\" trial that manipulates the mosquitoes that spread it, say scientists. \nThey used mosquitoes infected with \"miraculous\" bacteria that reduce the insect's ability to spread dengue. \nThe trial took place in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, and is being expanded in the hope of eradicating the virus. \nThe World Mosquito Programme team says it could be a solution to a virus that has gone around the world. \nFew people had heard of dengue 50 years ago, but it has been a relentless slow-burning pandemic and cases have increased dramatically. \nIn 1970, only nine countries had faced severe dengue outbreaks, now there are up to 400 million infections a year. \nDengue is commonly known as \"break-bone fever\" because it causes severe pain in muscles and bones and explosive outbreaks can overwhelm hospitals. \nThe trial used mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria. One of the researchers, Dr Katie Anders, describes them as \"naturally miraculous\".\nWolbachia doesn't harm the mosquito, but it camps out in the same parts of its body that the dengue virus needs to get into. \nThe bacteria compete for resources and make it much harder for dengue virus to replicate, so the mosquito is less likely to cause an infection when it bites again. \nThe trial used five million mosquito eggs infected with Wolbachia. Eggs were placed in buckets of water in the city every two weeks and the process of building up an infected population of mosquitoes took nine months. \nYogyakarta was split into 24 zones and the mosquitoes were released only in half of them. \nThe results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed a 77% reduction in cases and an 86% reduction in people needing hospital care when the insects were released.\n\"It's very exciting, it's better than we could have hoped for to be honest,\" Dr Anders told the BBC. \nThe technique has been so successful the mosquitoes have been released across the whole city and the project is moving to surrounding areas with the aim of eradicating dengue in the region. \nDr Anders, who is also the director of impact assessment at the World Mosquito Programme, said: \"This result is groundbreaking.\n\"We think it can have an even greater impact when it is deployed at scale in large cities around the world, where dengue is a huge public health problem.\"\nWolbachia are also spectacularly manipulative and can alter the fertility of their hosts to ensure they are passed on to the next generation of mosquitoes. \nIt means once Wolbachia has been established, it should stick around for a long time and continue to protect against dengue infection. \nThis is in sharp contrast to other control methods - such as insecticides or releasing large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes - that need to be kept up in order to suppress the blood-suckers. \nDr Yudiria Amelia, the head of disease prevention in Yogyakarta City, said: \"We are delighted with the outcome of this trial. \n\"We hope this method can be implemented in all areas of Yogyakarta and further expanded in all cities in Indonesia.\"\nThe trial is a significant landmark after years of research as the species of mosquito that spreads dengue - Aedes aegypti - is not normally infected with Wolbachia.\nDisease modelling studies have also predicted Wolbachia could be enough to completely suppress dengue fever if it can be established.\nDavid Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, said the method had \"exciting potential\" for other diseases such as Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya; which are also spread by mosquito bites. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "World leaders are gathering in the Cornish resort of Carbis Bay, for face-to-face meetings at the summit of G7 nations.\nAmong them are Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and President Biden, who is making his first foreign visit since taking office.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. \nRussia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014 for its takeover of Crimea.\nChina has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's biggest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are.\nRepresentatives from the European Union are present while India, South Korea and Australia have also been invited this year.\nThe G7's Cornwall meeting takes place from Friday 11 to Sunday 13 June.\nThe UK is holding the G7 presidency for 2021 so this is where the summit is taking place. \nThe meeting is taking place at the Carbis Bay Hotel near St Ives in Cornwall.\nThe region is seen as central to the UK's green technology sector. Showing off the country's green credentials is important to the government ahead of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November. \nIt is not the first time the world leaders have met in a beach resort. The last G7 summit, in 2019, was held in the French seaside town of Biarritz.\nDay-to-day life for locals and tourists in Cornwall is affected, including road and path closures.\nIn some areas of St Ives, residents have to provide proof of address in order to access their homes. \nThe UK government said it was important for world leaders to meet in person and regular Covid testing would take place.\nThroughout the year ministers and officials from the member countries hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events.\nAhead of this year's summit, the G7 finance ministers agreed to make multinational companies pay more tax.\nThe main event is when the G7 leaders come together to talk about the biggest issues of the day.\nThe agenda starts with a dinner at the Eden Project on Friday night, attended by the Queen and members of the Royal Family.\nThe main topic of conversation for the rest of the summit is Covid recovery, including \"a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics\".\nThe agenda also includes climate change and trade.\nBoris Johnson held talks with President Biden on Thursday afternoon. They covered topics including the President's concerns over the peace in Northern Ireland.\nMost of the conversations take place behind closed doors, but there are set-piece moments on camera - including the obligatory leaders' photo.\nAt the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document called a communique. This outlines what has been agreed by the leaders.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a press conference on Sunday.\nProtesting and policing are both more difficult this year because of Covid restrictions.\nMore than 5,000 extra officers - on top of 1,500 from Devon and Cornwall - will police the summit.\nA cruise ship has docked in nearby Falmouth to accommodate all the extra security officers.\nDemonstrators have been told they can gather in four approved protesting sites, including one in Exeter - more than 100 miles away.\nPolice have said they are \"not na\u00efve enough to expect that every protest will take place solely in those four sites\".\nClimate activist group Extinction Rebellion planned a number of demonstrations, including a march from Plymouth to Carbis Bay.\nIt can't pass any laws because it is made up of separate nations with their own democratic processes.\nHowever, some decisions can have global effects.\nFor example, the G7 played crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002.\nHowever, the G7 has been criticised as being an \"outdated group of countries\", partly because it does not include two of the largest countries in the world - India and China.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Recorded Covid infections among children are now the highest they have been during the outbreak in Scotland.\nWeekly infections in 0-14 year olds reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland.\nWhile there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill, growing numbers of pupils are off school.\nNicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the regulator.\nThe number of cases among the youngest age group is rising rapidly, having seen a near four-fold increase since early May.\nDespite the rise, medics have said children's wards are not seeing any significant rise in admissions due to Covid and said there is no reason for parents to worry.\nHowever, a number of schools have had to shut temporarily because of pupils testing positive, with St Peter's Primary in Galashiels among the latest to announce a short closure to allow contact tracing. \nWhile most schools are open, growing numbers of pupils have been asked to stay home because they are possible contacts of pupils who have tested positive.\nProvisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%, the lowest percentage since pupils returned after Easter. \nChildren under the age of 15 represent about quarter of the daily case numbers in recent weeks in terms of total numbers.\nHowever, when the size of the population in each age group is factored in, it is clear that infection rates are considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. \nOn 7 June, the weekly case rate among people in their early 20s was 277.2 per 100,000.\nOlder teenagers had the second highest rate, at 228.4, while for younger children it was 122.9.\nWhat is clear from the data is that infections among older age groups are relatively low during the latest outbreaks, possibly a reflection of the rollout of the vaccination programme.\nMore than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine.\nThe UK regulator has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15.\nThe Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)  on whether it should begin vaccinating children.\nOn Tuesday the first minister said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated but if the JCVI recommends vaccination of children, she said Scotland would \"move as quickly as possible to implement the advice\".\nScottish government adviser Prof Devi Sridhar has backed the rollout of the vaccine to those over the age of 12.\nSpeaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, she said: \"If we want schools to continue without disruption in the autumn and lift restrictions so children can have a normal experience, we need to vaccinate them \u2014 if we wait and watch for the evidence it will be too late in the next few weeks.\n\"We have the supply. It's not a large amount, it's a couple of million doses to cover that population of 12-plus.\n\"Given that we know children can transmit, where we are going to see problems is not going to be in care homes, it's not going to be in hospitals, it's going to be in schools.\"\nAnother leading health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, has said she \"really welcomed\" plans to vaccinate teenagers but said completing the adult age groups must come first. \nShe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"They will be next in line after we have issued vaccinations to all the 18-29 year olds, as Wales has already done. I really welcome the vaccine programme for teenagers... it will make a difference but they will not be able to receive it until older groups have. \n\"Over two million teenagers in the US have already received the vaccine, the trials suggest it's safe, so let's hope this all goes well.\" \nWith world leaders facing calls to do more to share vaccines internationally, some have argued a greater priority should be driving down infections globally, which could be the source of new variants. \nChristine Tait-Burkhard, an infection expert from University of Edinburgh, said it was a complex issue because while vaccination might help school attendance, there is little evidence of children becoming seriously ill. \nShe told Drivetime with John Beattie: \"The last question is an ethical one. If we are starting to vaccinate children in this country yet other countries haven't got any vaccines or very little vaccines to vaccinate their most vulnerable.\n\"It is not only an ethical question, it's also a message that it sends to the world that says we don't care.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has said that if enough immunity was built up through the adult vaccination programme then vaccinating children may not be justified.\nHe said: \"The issue is not that there's a problem doing it, it's just a question of whether we need to do it, given the very low incidence of serious illness in children and the fact that we're achieving so much with the adult programme at the moment with very high coverage.\n\"If indeed it turns out that children can be indirectly protected by the immunity that we induce in adults then there's clearly no justification for immunising - or at least immunising all of them.\" "

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Ireland\u2013UK border,Boris Johnson,G7 summits,Brexit,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden will tell PM Boris Johnson not to let the row over post-Brexit trading in Northern Ireland affect the peace process.\nThe two leaders are having their first face-to-face talks in Cornwall on the eve of the G7 summit. \nMr Biden will stress the need to \"stand behind\" the Northern Ireland protocol. \nThey will also discuss transatlantic travel and a new \"Atlantic Charter\" aimed at refreshing the relationship between the UK and US. \nThe US President is on his first overseas visit since being elected and the G7 summit is the first time world leaders have all gathered in person since the pandemic began. \nThe rollout of the coronavirus vaccination programme and climate change are high on their agenda.\nBut the ongoing dispute between the UK and the EU over regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from Great Britain is also likely to feature heavily in diplomatic discussions in the coming days. \nPresident Biden has a close interest in Ireland, given his ancestral roots, and had warned that the Good Friday Agreement must not be jeopardised by rows over trade. \nThe US was closely involved in drawing up the agreement - with American senator George Mitchell chairing the talks which led to the peace deal.\nBusiness and political leaders in Northern Ireland have warned that the trade dispute is causing political angst and instability in the run up to the marching season next month, a historical flashpoint between loyalist and nationalist communities. \nNorthern Ireland was given special status as a result of the 2019 Brexit \"divorce\" settlement between the UK and the EU.\nWhile England, Scotland and Wales no longer follow EU rules, Northern Ireland still does, because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nIn order to avoid a physical border between the two countries -  and thereby protect the peace process - it was agreed that customs checks would take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK.\nBut Unionists say this has effectively put a border down the Irish Sea instead - something they are ideologically opposed to - and business say supply chains have been complicated and disrupted. \nTalks on Wednesday between Brexit minister Lord Frost and the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to try to resolve the standoff  ended without a breakthrough.\nMr Sefcovic said the EU's patience was \"wearing very thin\" with the UK's attitude towards the protocol, after UK ministers said they were prepared to ignore parts of it to prevent disruption to goods like sausages and other chilled meats going to Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nAnd in a press conference on Thursday morning, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the protocol was the \"only solution\" to prevent a hard border with the Republic and must be implemented \"completely\".\nMr Johnson said on Wednesday that resolving the dispute with Brussels was \"easily doable\" and \"what we want to do is make sure that we can have a solution that...protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom\".\nBut speaking on a visit to Batley in West Yorkshire, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said President Biden had delivered an \"an unprecedented rebuke\" to the prime minister over the unresolved situation in Northern Ireland. \nSir Keir said he knew \"what it means for those communities and the way the government is going about this is undermining the peace process\", adding that the situation was also undermining the UK's relationship with the US.\n\"The government needs to make much more of an effort to settle this, to negotiate and get to a settlement for the people of Northern Ireland and for the world.\"\nLeader of the DUP Edwin Poots said Mr Biden's comments were \"not well informed\" and argued that the protocol had been responsible for a rise in violence in Northern Ireland. \nHowever Irish PM Micheal Martin said the US president was urging the UK to do \"the sensible thing\" and resolve its trade issues with the EU.\nDuring their meeting in Carbis Bay, Mr Johnson and President Biden are expected to agree to set up a taskforce to make recommendations on safely resuming international travel.\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss described its creation as \"a first step towards reopening the skies\" but warned that the \"absence of a definitive timeframe\" means airlines, businesses and consumers are still in the dark. \nThe prime minister is coming under fire for his own travel arrangements to Cornwall.\nCritics say taking a private jet rather than a train to the summit tarnishes his green credentials and Britain's claim to be a world leader on climate change. \nMr Johnson defended his decision saying: \"If you attack my arrival by plane, I respectfully point out the UK is actually in the lead in developing sustainable aviation fuel, and one of the points in the 10 point plan of our green industrial revolution, is to get to 'jet zero' as well.\"\nOrganisers have been forced to change the location of the talks between the President and Mr Johnson after bad weather ruled out holding them at St Michael's Mount, a castle on a tidal island off the coast of Cornwall.\nReports suggested their wives, Carrie Johnson and First Lady Jill Biden, were also due to tour the beauty spot but a No 10 source confirmed the visit was \"sadly off due to the weather\".\nInstead, the leaders are meeting in Carbis Bay, the location for Friday's summit.

      "title": "G7 summit: Why does it matter?",
      "text": "Do summits like this matter? \"Occasionally!\" comes the answer from a former government insider who worked for years at the very top. \nThey warn that global get-togethers - however glamorous the location, however acute any particular political emergency, however good the freebies for the thousands of attendees - can descend into 'waffelage'. \nAs the most powerful elected people in the world prepare to occupy a tiny Cornish bay for a few days, will this be an occasion that makes a difference to any of our lives or will it be waffle in the end? \nA senior diplomat closely involved in the preparation is confident, \"this will be very meaningful.\"\nIt is the first time the new American president will have met the relatively new British prime minister in person - a big moment by any measure. \nAnd it's the first time that the leaders of the world's biggest democracies have gathered like this since their countries were hit by a genuine emergency - Covid. \nThis current cast of leaders, particularly with a new boss in the White House, has given the impression in the run up to this meeting that they want genuinely to work together as the pandemic, while still with us, begins to fade. \nThe next few days will show whether they really mean it or not.  \nEven in the age of video calls and instant messages pinging their way around the world, summits do matter, because leaders and their officials can talk face to face. \nReal business can get done during \"the hallway conversations, the drinks at the bar\", the diplomat says.  \nHuge public attention puts the pressure on, and the moment where they all wave goodbye and climb back into their limos or helicopters provides a deadline to decide.   \nWithout doubt, real life contact makes a difference to what is decided. \nOne former senior figure in Theresa May's administration recalls a moment of jeopardy at a summit with President Trump. \nHe was planning to leave early, without signing up to the form of words that the other nations wanted. \nThe former official told me he was ushered into what was described as a \"secure broom cupboard\" with the then Australian leader, Malcolm Turnbull and the French President, Emmanuel Macron. \nIt's said they remained locked in argument in the tiny room, until Mr Trump agreed. \nAt a different G7 meeting in 2018, again the other nations were struggling to get Mr Trump and his officials to agree on the principles the others wanted to publish. \nThe dispute was over if and how the final document would refer to the \"international rules based order\" - the loose jargon for how democracies agree to behave and work with each other through shared institutions like the UN. \nWithout a specific definition of what the \"rules based order\" really meant though, the US was reluctant.  \nSo a small group of leaders themselves and a few key officials haggled face-to-face with the president and his powerful adviser, John Bolton, outside the formal meetings to do a deal. \nThe compromise was that the document would refer to \"a\" rules based order, not \"the\" when referring to the \"international rules based order\". \nAt a summit, leaders of the free world, and a few of their close aides, spent precious time arguing over the use of the definite or indefinite article...\nAnd some of the broader tensions during that meeting were captured in a classic photograph.\nSummits are the product of months and months of work by the hosts, and are carefully planned to within an inch of their lives and are huge opportunities for countries to show off. \nCovering the meetings over the years I've witnessed astonishing firework displays in China, the Argentine first lady hosting an elaborate tea party for leaders' spouses where even the air kissing seemed to be choreographed, parades, concerts, and plenty of the events themselves that are designed to show the leaders' interactions to the world. \nSummits have their own language too - the 'family photos' - the moments where the leaders have to take pre-appointed places for official snaps to be taken. \nThe 'bilats' or 'trilats' - one-to-one, or one-to-two meetings where the bond, or lack of, between the politicians is so blindingly obvious. \nThe 'communique' - the final document that leaders sign up to that's published at the end; prepared for months in advance by the 'sherpas', senior officials for each country, but the final version agreed only by the leaders themselves at the last minute. \nBut when the most senior politicians in the world and their most senior staff are in essence locked down together for a few days it is those unscripted moments that stick in the mind. \nBumping into a European prime minister who was wandering around a corridor in Brussels, who seemed lost, but said yes to an interview then and there in the dingy basement, filmed on a phone - that made the news.\nOne very early morning in a hot, foreign clime when trying to get some sea air to wake up after only a couple of hours of sleep, I encountered a very prominent official on the beach who rather mysteriously had company at that time of day. \nOne of their colleagues, seconds later, came leaping out of the sea having been confronted by some jellyfish - ending the need for a longer, awkward conversation. \nWhen a tense European summit dragged on with David Cameron, while we hacks were still hanging around inside waiting for news, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had had enough and popped out with her team for chips. \nAnd at the prime minister's own first summit in charge in Biarritz he went for his own swim off the French Atlantic coast. \nOf course, Boris Johnson being Boris Johnson, he didn't keep it to himself, but in classic style he used his swim out to a large rock as a metaphor for supporters for his hoped for heroics on Brexit.\nOne diplomat expressed concern at the notion of the leaders taking a dip this time round worrying about the all important 'optics'.  \nBut alongside the very serious hoped for progress on vaccines, on Covid recovery, on the climate, on reaffirming the links between the most powerful democracies in the world after the Trump Presidency, the events that have not been planned might be the ones that stay in the mind. \nThe next few days will also see the first official public engagements of the new Mrs Carrie Johnson. \nLike it or not, always nicknamed the \"leaders' wives\" summit, the \"spousal programme\" as it's officially termed is a universe all of its own. \nThis time, without question, this G7 should be an occasion that matters, for the serious discussions that are due to take place. \nThe government hopes for strong confirmation of the relationship between the UK and the US, commitments to help get vaccines to the developing world, and for progress on climate change. \nThey plan also for convincing conversations with the other nations that have been invited, what the prime minister is terming the \"football team\" - the \"D 11\" - the G7 plus India (attending virtually), South Korea, South Africa and Australia too, forging links ever more important among democracies in the face of growing influence from China. \nBut this summit will also matter for the glimpses of our leaders, and snapshots of the vital relationships they forge.

      "text": "Travel industry figures have dismissed the latest moves by the US and UK to reopen travel.\nA new taskforce will be set up to make recommendations on easing restrictions as part of an \"Atlantic Charter\", set to be agreed on Thursday.\nA Number 10 statement said the prime minister and president would \"work to relaunch UK-US travel as soon as possible\".\nBut the boss of Virgin Atlantic said the announcement \"falls short\".\nChief executive Shai Weiss said: \"The creation of the Atlantic Taskforce is positive recognition of the importance of the UK-US travel corridor and a first step towards reopening the skies.\"\nBut he said the lack of a specific time frame for reopening travel meant airlines, businesses and passengers faced a lack of certainty.\nAhead of the start of the G7 summit in Cornwall, Mr Weiss urged Mr Biden and Mr Johnson to allow trans-Atlantic travel no later than 4 July.\nNearly all passengers from the UK are currently banned from travelling to the US.\nUnder a presidential decree introduced last March, non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days cannot enter the country unless a specific exemption applies.\nMeanwhile, travellers from the US to the UK must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival as the country is on the \"amber list\".\nRead more on restrictions when travelling to Amber list countries here.\nClive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, also called for a firm commitment on a date.\n\"We welcome the formation of the Atlantic Charter 2021 as a step in the right direction for transatlantic travel. \n\"However, this is the latest in a long line of travel taskforces which so far have only wreaked further devastation on our industry. Jobs won't be saved, nor livelihoods protected, until we are given a certainty on dates for the resumption of international travel.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Association of British Travel Agents said that \"steps to get travel restarted are very welcome\". But she also pointed out the lack of detail in the announcement.\nShe added: \"Consideration should also be given to capitalising on the success of the UK vaccine rollout by relaxing rules for fully vaccinated individuals when travelling between low-risk areas, as the US, and many other countries, are already doing.\"\nThe taskforce will be overseen in the UK by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and will be chaired by senior officials in the US and UK.\nIt will \"work to explore options for resuming US-UK travel and ensure that the UK and US closely share thinking and expertise on international travel policy going forward\", Downing Street said in a statement.\nIt added: \"Links between the UK and US are not only crucial for our people, they create and sustain jobs across and throughout our two countries.\"\nIn a letter calling for trans-Atlantic travel to reopen on Monday, airline bosses and Heathrow Airport estimated that UK businesses are losing \u00a323m each day that the route remains closed.\nBoris Johnson and Joe Biden will also agree to work together on issues such as the post-pandemic recovery, climate change and security as part of Atlantic Charter, which is expected to be agreed when they meet on Thursday in Cornwall.\nThe original Atlantic Charter was a joint statement made by Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt in 1941, setting out joint goals in the wake of the Second World War."

      "text": "Regular and strenuous exercise increases the risk of motor neurone disease in people who are genetically vulnerable, say scientists. \nThe team at the University of Sheffield said nobody should stop exercising as a result of their study. \nBut they hope the findings could lead to ways of screening people who may be at higher risk and give tailored advice. \nOverall, around one in 300 people will develop motor neurone disease. \nIt affects people's ability to move, talk and even breathe as the motor neurones that carry messages from the brain to the muscles fail. It can dramatically shorten people's lives. \nWho gets it and why is a complicated, poorly-understood mix of the genetic risk you are born with and other environmental factors that build up over a lifetime. \nThere has long been a connection between exercise and the disease, but whether it was a genuine \"cause\" or just a \"coincidence\" has been the source of fierce debate. \nStudies in Italian footballers have suggested rates up to six times higher than normal. Athletes including Rob Burrow (rugby league), Stephen Darby (football) and Doddie Weir (rugby union) have all spoken openly about the disease.\n\"We have conclusively said exercise is a risk factor for motor neurone disease\", Dr Johnathan Cooper-Knock, one of the researchers, said.\n\"The numbers of high profile athletes affected with MND is not a coincidence.\"\nThe researchers analysed data from the UK Biobank project, which has detailed genetic samples from half a million people. \nThey used a technique called Mendelian randomisation to turn that data into an experiment, and showed people whose DNA makes them more likely to do strenuous activity were more likely to get MND.\nThe study, published in the journal EBioMedicine, also showed: \nStrenuous and regular was defined as more than 15-30 minutes on more than 2-3 days per week. But obviously, most people who exercise that much do not develop motor neurone disease. \nDr Cooper-Knock said: \"We don't know who is at risk and we wouldn't go as far as advising who should and shouldn't exercise.\n\"If everyone stopped exercising that would do more harm than good.\"\nThe hope is the work will eventually lead to a way of tailoring advice similar to screening footballers for heart problems.\nProf Dame Pamela Shaw, the director of the Neuroscience Institute in Sheffield, said: \"This research goes some way towards unravelling the link between high levels of physical activity and the development of MND in certain genetically at-risk groups.\"\nIt is thought low levels of oxygen in the body during strenuous exercise could be leading to a process called oxidative stress in the motor neurones - some of the biggest and most oxygen-demanding cells in the body.\nThis may lead to damage and eventually cause the cells to die in people who have that genetic vulnerability. \nDr Brian Dickie, from the Motor Neurone Disease Association said more research along these lines was needed.\nHe said the genetic and environmental components of MND were often studied in isolation whereas \"the power of this research comes from bringing these pieces of the puzzle together\".\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Deepcut,British Army,Ministry of Defence,Deepcut deaths,Surrey Police",
      "text": "A fifth soldier died at an Army base where four recruits were found dead between 1995 and 2002, it has emerged.\nPrivates Sean Benton, Cheryl James, Geoff Gray and James Collinson were all discovered with gunshot wounds at Deepcut Barracks, Surrey.\nIt can now be revealed another private, Anthony Bartlett, was found dead after a suspected overdose in July 2001.\nA former detective who investigated the later deaths at Deepcut said it was \"staggering\" he was not told about it.\nRetired Det Ch Insp Colin Sutton, who was the senior investigating officer for Surrey Police, said the death of Pte Bartlett had been hidden from him.\nThe Ministry of Defence told Newsnight the coroner had found Pte Bartlett's death was an accident and it strongly rejected any suggestion it had covered it up.\nBetween 1995 and 2002, four young recruits died of gunshot wounds at the Princess Royal Barracks, near the town of Deepcut, Surrey.  The Army insisted these were suicides, though the families disagreed.\nDCI Colin Sutton was asked to investigate two of the deaths - of Pte Geoff Gray who died of two gunshot wounds in September 2001 and Pte James Collinson who died in March 2002.\nHowever, he says he was not told that just two months before the death of Pte Gray there had been another death at the barracks, although Surrey Police had investigated it at the time.\nThe circumstances were different. Pte Bartlett, from Newton Stewart, Dumfries and Galloway, died from an overdose of Co-Proxamol - a strong painkiller that he had been prescribed by Army doctors for acute Achilles tendonitis, an injury he sustained during his five months at Deepcut.\nFormer DCI Sutton told Newsnight that Pte Bartlett's death had been \"kept hidden from me effectively\". \n\"Nobody told me about it,\" he said. \"If you're the senior investigating officer looking at the deaths of two soldiers at Deepcut and there's another death of a soldier that you're not told about, you know, it's just staggering to me. \n\"I just don't understand how that information can be kept from an investigation team that's looking at this at that barracks.\" \nThe fifth death is revealed in a new seven-part Audible podcast, Death at Deepcut, which delves into the circumstances surrounding what happened.\nIn the 19 years since the deaths at Deepcut made headlines, debate has raged over what led to four privates losing their lives in training in peacetime, all in similar circumstances.  \nThere was a review in 2006 led by Sir Nicholas Blake QC.  It criticised Army training, citing \"harassment, discrimination and oppressive behaviour\", but concluded that the deaths were probably self-inflicted. \nThere was no mention in Sir Nicholas's review of the death of Pte Bartlett. \nMost recently, fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Gray and James recorded suicide verdicts. The second hearing into Pte Benton's death confirmed the original inquest's conclusion that he had taken his own life.\nThe first inquest into the death of James Collinson ended in an open verdict. His parents dropped their bid for a new inquest in 2019 saying they did not have the strength to see it through.\nJames Collinson's mother, Yvonne, said she was \"flabbergasted\" that after years of battling for information about what happened to her son she is discovering there was another, up-to-now unpublicised death, just eight months before.\n\"All these years of experience with the Army and the police, they don't offer any truths and try and hide things from you that they think might cause them a bit of trouble,\" she told Newsnight.\n\"I also feel for the family of this young man. I suspect they didn't get very much support from the Army because I know we certainly didn't.  Only we understand how it feels. My condolences to them.\"\nThe Ministry of Defence strongly rejected claims it tried to hide a fifth death, saying Pte Bartlett's case was investigated by the police and ruled to be an accidental death by the coroner.  \nIn a statement the MoD said its \"thoughts remain with Pte Bartlett's family and all those affected by this tragic accident\".  \nIt adds that the deaths of the other four recruits were a \"tragedy\" and it sends its condolences to the families.\nThe statement continues: \"The armed forces take the responsibility for the welfare of service personnel very seriously. \n\"The Deepcut review of 2006 by Nicholas Blake QC made a number of recommendations, the majority of which were fully accepted. \n\"We will continue to support the health and wellbeing of all personnel throughout their time in the military and beyond.\"\nIn a statement, Surrey Police said the deaths of Sean Benton, Cheryl James, Geoff Gray and James Collinson were \"a tragic loss of life\". \n\"Surrey Police has previously accepted that mistakes were made during the initial stages of investigations into these deaths, including a failure to properly capture forensic evidence and to maintain primacy for the investigations. \n\"That these errors resulted in further suffering for the families remains a matter of deep regret,\" the force said. \nThe statement added that \"all the available evidence was examined\" at inquests into the four soldiers' deaths. \n\"The families of Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte Cheryl James have since sought new inquests... We hope that the conclusions of these new inquests provided their families with the clarification they had been seeking.\"\nThe statement concludes: \"Unless any new evidence comes to light, the investigations remain closed. If any further evidence is forthcoming, it will, of course, be thoroughly explored.\""

      "text": "The town of St Ives and neighbouring village of Carbis Bay are in full view of the world this week.\nThe G7 summit is being held in these often tranquil, and beautiful coastal communities less than 20 miles (32km) from Land's End in Cornwall.\nPreparations have been ongoing since the shock announcement in January, and now the reality has arrived.\n\"It is exciting and impressive, but intimidating,\" Carbis Bay resident Mary Tincombe, 63, said.\nShe lives within the so-called ring-of-steel, a black metal fence which is about 10ft (3m) high and surrounds the village locking out all but the locals, the special guests, and lots of police.\n\"I walked to the post office this morning, a 15-minute walk and we must have walked past about 100 police officers. \n\"It is very, very real. It feels like another lockdown.\"\nFor more than a month the police have been in the village, inspecting drains, installing CCTV and lights, but this week it has been ramped up.\nBusses and lorries carrying hoarding materials frequently pass to get to the Carbis Bay Hotel, where the leaders will meet.\nIt is at the bottom of the one, very steep, road through the village to the beach.\nOut to sea naval ships are now regularly scouring the coastline, while in the skies there has already been an impressive show of military and diplomatic planes and helicopters.\nMs Tincombe's partner Chris drives a minibus taxi and has been taken off the rota for five days due to the difficulties of getting out of the village, and back again.\nThey are not planning to get in the car and leave the village until after the summit on Monday.\nThe Bean Inn at the top of the village has got just one booking on each of Thursday and Friday nights, \"a complete contrast to normal\".\n\"We have had hundreds of inquiries but as soon as we are honest about the difficulties they will have getting to us, most of them are put off,\" Kate Horrill said.\nThe scenic option for getting from Carbis Bay to St Ives would be the South West Coast Path or the train along the coast, but both have been closed off for the summit.\nThe town of St Ives, from this vantage point, is full of pretty buildings wedged around the harbour which, when the sun shines, glows aqua with light that makes it a haven for artists.\nIt is also this that attracts second home owners and tourists - and perhaps G7 summit hosts.\nIts population is about 12,000, and on an average summer day an extra 15,000 people will squeeze into the narrow streets, according to Visit Cornwall.\nAt the harbour there are people milling about, some eating ice creams or pasties, despite the signs warning of hungry seagulls.\nAlthough 5,500 extra police officers have been drafted in, there are not many around the harbour, and delivery vans are passing through without problems. \nThere are no signs up about the G7, and no real indication that seven of the world's most powerful people will be gathering about a mile away in Carbis Bay later this week.\n\"It is really quiet, much quieter than it should be at this time of year,\" Megan Steeds from St Ives Boat Rides says from her stand on the slip-way.\n\"We have had about 50 or 60% cancellations.\n\"We are now thinking if it is even worth staying open this weekend.\"\nDylan Lee, who works for her, adds \"maybe we should all shut down along the harbour and try to get compensation\".\n\"It's not just us but all the shops too.\"\nAlso, beside the harbour, Billy Thomas says his glass-bottomed boat trips are not viable because the reef he takes passengers over is deemed too close to Carbis Bay by the authorities.\n\"I emailed the Cabinet Office about compensation weeks ago, but was told no, because it would be 'business as usual'. Well this is anything but normal.\"\nThe BBC has also contacted the Cabinet Office for a response.\nFurther around the harbour, the lifeboat station will be manned all week due to \"concerns over crews responding to pagers, and navigating through the town and the tourists,\" senior helm George Deacon said.\nSpeaking about the G7 coming to his corner of the world, Mr Deacon said he thinks it is a \"really good thing\". \n\"It puts not only St Ives, but Cornwall on the world map.\"\nThe RNLI also provides the lifeguards on the beaches and has drafted in extra staff, including on Porthmeor Beach which is currently overlooked by two Royal Navy war ships. \nNear the lifeboat station is the Salvation Army building that was severely damaged by a fire in 2020.\nPresents and aid destined for low income families in the area were destroyed but the community stepped in to raise more than \u00a332,000.\nNathan Thomas is a volunteer and said the fundraising showed the collective spirit in St Ives, but had a message for the visiting dignitaries.\n\"From a practical point of view St Ives isn't wealthy - it's got very wealthy people here. It is impoverished and has got just as many issues as anywhere else. \n\"It is a harsh place to live because it has such a masquerade - it is so beautiful and so wonderful and the world leaders are coming to our town. And yet there is such a forgotten community out there.\"\nBehind the harbour, up the hill just a few roads, is a part of town where more than a third of children live in poverty.\nThe foodbank, run from the All Saints Parish Church, says it has seen a fourfold increase in demand since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nCornwall received large amounts of EU funding, as one of the poorest areas in Europe.\nElsewhere, St Ives resident Thomas Cocking, 64, believes the summit is a \"total and utter complete waste of money and time\".\nHe has lived in the town his whole life, is a former lifeboat coxswain, a role currently filled by his brother. His great-great-grandfather was killed in a lifeboat disaster 82 years ago.\n\"We don't need any more people here. My brother-in-law was a fisherman but had to move out of town because there was nowhere to park. \n\"We have had public toilets closed, the police station is being sold off, and the hospital has already gone. Why here?\n\"People say its just a few days but it has been more like seven weeks. \n\"I can't walk to the end of my road without someone in a yellow coat asking me what I am doing.\"\nNot everybody is against it. Amy Smith, 27, says she thinks it is \"quite positive\", but tempers that with a concern that rents are so high that people working in hospitality cannot afford to stay for the summer season.\n\"It's got a lot worse this year,\" she said.\nLeon Andrews, 19, said: \"I think it is great, it's the most interesting thing to happen in St Ives for a while. \n\"I don't know why people are complaining. \n\"I mean, I am a delivery driver for the local curry house and they have cancelled all the deliveries for this weekend, so it is disruptive. \n\"But I still think it is a good thing.\"\nJudy Garratt lives in a house overlooking the town and said while the summit is causing some inconvenience \"when you live here you expect it to be busy in the summer anyway - us locals are used to it.\"\nShe believes it may have benefits. \"I'm not sure St Ives needs the publicity, but other areas in Cornwall will hopefully get highlighted. \n\"If it brings in money to help eliminate some of the poverty then that would be the main thing.\""

      "tags": "Ellon,BrewDog",
      "text": "Former staff at Brewdog have alleged a \"culture of fear\" at the beer firm with a \"toxic attitude\" to junior employees.\nIn an open letter, signatories said a \"significant number\" of former staff had \"suffered mental illness as a result of working at BrewDog\".\nThey claimed that the firm was built around a \"cult of personality\" of founders James Watt and Martin Dickie.\nMr Watt said Brewdog was \"sorry\" and that it would not contest the letter, but \"listen, learn and act\".\nThe Scottish brewer and pub-chain rapidly rose into the mainstream after major supermarkets started stocking it in 2008.\nBut it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions. \nThe open letter, which was posted on Twitter and signed by more than 60 former staff, made a number of allegations, including a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.\nIt said Mr Watt and Mr Dickie had exploited publicity, \"both good and bad\" to further their own business goals and chased \"growth, at all costs\".\nIt added: \"You spent years claiming you wanted to be the best employer in the world, presumably to help you to recruit top talent, but ask former staff what they think of those claims, and you'll most likely be laughed at. \n\"Being treated like a human being was sadly not always a given for those working at Brewdog.\"\nAccording to the letter, toxic attitudes towards junior staff had \"trickled down\" throughout the business \"until they were simply an intrinsic part of the company\".\n\"Put bluntly, the single biggest shared experience of former staff is a residual feeling of fear. Fear to speak out about the atmosphere we were immersed in, and fear of repercussions even after we have left,\" it added.\nOne of the ex-staff members who signed the letter, Christopher Baria-Lewis, told the BBC he \"felt it was important, with former colleagues, to get a message out there\".\n\"Their [Brewdog's] external persona doesn't align with how they operate,\" he said, adding that the letter had been organised collectively.\nThe letter also questioned Brewdog's commitment to sustainability after \"years of vanity projects\" and use of a private jet.\nAlong with many breweries, pubs, and other parts of the hospitality industry, Brewdog has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Watt said: \"At Brewdog, we are focused on building the best business we can, which is why the open letter we saw on Twitter was so upsetting, but so important.\n\"Our focus now is not on contradicting or contesting the details of that letter, but to listen, learn and act.\n\"As a fast-growing business, we have always tried to do the best by our team - we do have thousands of employees with positive stories to tell as a result.\"\nBut he said the tweet by former staff proved that \"on many occasions we haven't got it right\".\n\"We are committed to doing better, not just as a reaction to this, but always; and we are going to reach out to our entire team past and present to learn more.\n\"But most of all, right now, we are sorry.\"\nHe said it had been \"hard to hear\" the comments, but added: \"It must have been harder to say them. \n\"We appreciate that and we will endeavour to honour that effort and courage with the real change it deserves. We aren't going to make excuses, we're going to take action.\"\nBrewdog started out in 2007, being passionate about craft beer and contemptuous of rival big brewers. It's become at least as passionate about growth, by unconventional \"punk\" means. \nSo far, there is a big brewery in Aberdeenshire, plus others in Berlin, Brisbane and Columbus, Ohio. There are more than 100 Brewdog bars, dotted across the world map. And a new project is beer-themed hotels, in Ohio, Manchester and Edinburgh.\nThis has been funded through the sale of a big chunk of the business to private equity and several rounds of crowdfunding. The AGM in Aberdeen has become something of a party.\nBut it seems the combined publicity-thirsty passion for beer and growth has been bruising. Every employer has disgruntled ex-employees. Usually, once dispersed, they moan into their beer. But in this case, these ex-staff signatories have taken their passion for beer and applied it to improving working conditions in their industry.\nCo-founder James Watt concedes he didn't always \"get things right\".  He dispensed with the usual combative defiance. His response is chastened, recognising that the accusations could be damaging to the brand and to recruitment. \nHe has become very successful by inviting drinkers to buy into products infused with the passion of beer people. So this runs counter to the values of clubby comradeship. Repairing the damage will take more nuance than Brewdog usually deploys."

The US president and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet for the first time on Thursday, ahead of the G7 summit in the south-western corner of England.\nAlso in his eight-day trip Mr Biden will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and join his first Nato summit as president. He has said the visit is about \"America rallying the world's democracies\". \nThe US president is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at the end of his travels in Europe.\nThe US government will donate the vaccines to 92 lower-income countries and the African Union, Reuters news agency reports. \nDistribution will go through the Covax scheme, which was set up last year to try to ensure fair access to vaccines among rich and poor nations. \nThe US had previously said it would donate 60m vaccine doses through Covax.\nPeople familiar with the deal told the New York Times that the US would pay for the doses at a \"not-for-profit\" price.\nAlbert Bourla, chief executive of Pfizer, is expected to appear with Mr Biden when he officially announces the initiative on Thursday.\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson said he would urge G7 leaders to commit to vaccinating the world against Covid-19 by the end of next year.\nThe UK and Canada have not yet said how many doses they will provide to the Covax scheme.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - plus the EU.\nOther G7 leaders will arrive in Cornwall on Friday, and meetings will get under way the following morning.\nThe main topic of conversation will be Covid recovery, including \"a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics\".\nThe agenda also includes climate change and trade.\nMr Biden is expected to warn that the ongoing UK-EU trade row could imperil peace in Northern Ireland. He will call on fellow leaders to protect the gains of the Good Friday agreement.\nAt the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document outlining what has been agreed by the leaders.\nThe first US-Russia summit of the Biden presidency will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June.\nIt comes at the tail end of Mr Biden's trip, giving the president plenty of time to hear from US allies beforehand.\nThe White House has indicated that he intends to cover a \"full range of pressing issues\" with his Russian counterpart, including arms control, climate change, Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Russia's cyber-hacking activities and the jailing of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.\nThree organisations linked to Mr Navalny were outlawed by a Moscow court on Wednesday as \"extremist\".\nMr Putin threw cold water on the Biden meeting last week, saying he hoped to improve the \"extremely low level of relations\" between the two countries but expected no breakthroughs.\nSpeaking in Suffolk on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said that the US was not seeking conflict with Russia but wanted a stable, predictable relationship.\n\"I've been clear: the United States will respond in a robust and meaningful way if the Russian government engages in harmful activities.\"\nHe said he would tell Mr Putin there were consequences for \"violating the sovereignty of democracies in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere\".\nThe transatlantic alliance (Nato) would remain a vital source of strength for the UK, Europe and the US, the president said.\nThe White House said Mr Biden's meeting with Mr Johnson ahead of the summit would \"affirm the enduring strength\" of the countries' \"special relationship\".\nBoth leaders took part in a virtual climate action summit hosted by the US in April but have not yet met in person.\nThe president and First Lady Jill Biden will also be received by the Queen at Windsor Castle.\nIt will be the 95-year-old monarch's first meeting with a foreign leader since the death of her husband Prince Philip.\nThe next leg of Mr Biden's trip takes him to Brussels, where he will meet leaders of other Nato countries.\nUS relations with Nato were strained under his predecessor Donald Trump, but Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg - in a White House visit on Monday - hailed Mr Biden's \"powerful commitment\" to US allies."

      "title": "US-UK special relationship: How goes it under Biden and Johnson?",
      "tags": "US election 2020,Boris Johnson,Brexit,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Boris Johnson and Joe Biden will meet near the cliff tops overlooking the magnificent Carbis Bay in Cornwall, the waves from the Atlantic crashing below.\nIt won't have the bodice-ripping tension and tempestuousness of an encounter between Ross Poldark and Demelza - until now the most famous pairing from these parts thanks to the BBC hit drama - but this is an important relationship to watch as it develops.\nThe reasons why it might get off to a horrible start are all too easy to enumerate. Biden firmly supported Britain remaining in the EU; Johnson was the leading architect of Brexit. \nBiden is perhaps the most \"Irish\" (I put it in inverted commas because a lot of Americans in public life like to play up their Irish roots - though Biden's are very clear) of recent US presidents, and the Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct for him - and so he will make clear to his British host there can be no tinkering with the Northern Ireland protocol if it puts that long-fought-over agreement in jeopardy. \nBoris Johnson clearly wants to get out of the binding agreement - freely signed by the British to get Brexit done - that in effect puts a trade barrier down the Irish Sea between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. \nIn a pre-visit interview, Joe Biden's national security adviser told me that Britain should not underestimate the strength of Biden's feelings on this subject.\nAnd then there is the back story of the two men - Boris Johnson was seen by many in the US as Britain's Donald Trump (certainly by Donald Trump himself) - a bit chaotic, populist, unpredictable, a rabble rouser. And in return Boris Johnson was lavish in his praise of the former business tycoon occupying the White House - he was Making America Great Again said the British PM; he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in North Korea.\nAnd no-one would say that Joe Biden is cut from the same privileged cloth as Boris Johnson. Somehow I can't quite imagine the young working class Joe from Scranton, Pennsylvania, in Bullingdon Club white tie. Indeed Biden went as far as describing Johnson as a \"physical and emotional clone\" of Donald Trump.\nBut equally, if you delve back into the manila folder of yellowing newspaper cuttings - or just used your search engine - you will find plenty of disobliging comments from BoJo from when he was mayor of London, talking about Trump's \"stupefying ignorance\". \nAll of which leads to an obvious point. That was then. Now is now.\nIf we're talking of presidents and PMs not being cut from the same cloth, you would have to say that David Cameron and Barack Obama were hardly obvious soulmates, yet they forged a close working relationship. To Cameron's credit - he didn't obsess and fret about the special relationship in the way that some others have done. Remember Gordon Brown chasing Barack Obama through a kitchen at the UN so desperate was he to have a face to face with the American president?\nIf you're the British prime minister you make it your business to get on with whoever the elected US president of the day is. In the days after the 2020 presidential election when Donald Trump was insisting it was all a fraud and he would overturn the result (actually, come to think of it, seven months on he is still saying the same thing), the Johnson government was very speedy to note that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor and was duly congratulated by the British. Some countries havered on doing the same, fearful of incurring the wrath of Donald Trump. \nOn some of the biggest ticket items facing the world, Biden and Johnson are completely aligned. Perhaps most notably, on climate change and the upcoming COP26 UN climate change conference being hosted in Glasgow in November - but also on national security issues, defence co-operation and intelligence sharing, Britain and the US are very closely aligned.\nGo back in history, and few would have imagined that after the apparent bromance between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, with all their windy rhetoric about The Third Way (I really can't decide whether the idea deserves capital letters or not - I'll leave them there for now), that the British PM would have transitioned so effortlessly into forging such a close relationship with George W Bush - of course many then criticised Blair for becoming too close to Bill Clinton's successor. \nI think the only relationship where there was lasting damage came when Bill Clinton was elected president and John Major was prime minister. Major's efforts to help George HW Bush win re-election by allowing the Home Office to look into whether there was any \"dirt\" on Bill Clinton from when he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford was a big mistake, and probably had a lasting impact.\nIt's hard to believe that Biden and Johnson will be a recreation of the Thatcher and Reagan relationship - or going back further, Churchill and FDR - Churchill during the terrifying blitz in 1940 would talk about courting and cultivating the US leader, endlessly finding ways to capture his attention - and critically support - to bring the US into the Second World War.\nThe other week on our podcast Americast, I spoke to Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's former deputy national security adviser, and joked about the special relationship. Remember this is something that the British political class talk much more about than the Americans. \nBut Rhodes made the point that there is such a commonality of interest, so many shared values, that when you sit down with the British to discuss major issues, you invariably find yourself starting from the same point. How you get to the end point might differ, but being of like mind is a good start for the relationship between Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. On most things they are.\nAnd with Britain forging a post-Brexit future that is critically important.\nOne thing the two men do have in common is that both men are Roman Catholics - though as one wag noted drily - one is a practising Roman Catholic; the other is in need of a lot more practice."

      "tags": "Culture,Statues and sculptures,Oxford,Students,University of Oxford",
      "text": "About 150 Oxford University academics are refusing to teach at one of its colleges after it decided to keep its controversial statue of Cecil Rhodes.\nFor years campaigners have been calling for the statue at Oriel College to go, saying Rhodes stood for white supremacy and racism.\nBut last month the college decided not to take it down for practical reasons.\nNow, some academics are boycotting Oriel and have signed a petition saying the statue \"glorifies colonialism\".\nThey are refusing to give tutorials to undergraduates from Oriel or attend talks there, as first reported by the Daily Telegraph.\nThe college expressed \"sadness\" at the decision, while the head of Oxford University said she was \"deeply disappointed\".\nA No 10 spokesman said the government would expect \"appropriate action\" to be taken if the teaching of students was disrupted by the dispute, such as providing compensation.\nRhodes was a businessman and politician who played a big role in southern Africa in the 19th Century. \nHe thought of the English as a master race, and his critics see him as the ultimate representation of colonialism and one of the people who helped pave the way for apartheid.\nHe had been a student at Oriel, and his statue is now above a doorway of a building named after him.\nOriel's governing body said last year that the majority of its members wished the statue to be removed. \nBut after an inquiry, the college decided not to remove it due to the cost and complex planning processes.\nThe Oxford lecturers say the college's decision not to remove the statue \"undermines us all\", and that the whole university can only work to eradicate racism if all its colleges do so.\n\"Faced with Oriel's stubborn attachment to a statue that glorifies colonialism and the wealth it produced for the college, we feel we have no choice but to withdraw all discretionary work and goodwill collaborations,\" a statement from the boycott organisers said.\nAs well as refusing to tutor Oriel students, the dons will also not help the college when it interviews admissions candidates or attend talks sponsored by it.\nThe boycott does not include work which is not discretionary, such as exams, delivering lecturers and supervising postgraduate students.\nThe dons said the boycott was done \"with regret\" but would continue \"until Oriel makes a credible public commitment to remove the statue\".\nDanny Dorling, professor of geography at Oxford and one of the signatories, said: \"Having your university associated with a statue of a racist is deeply upsetting and puts a smear on the whole university.\"\nBut a No 10 spokesman said: \"Students rightly expect to get a good deal for their investment in higher education and we would expect universities to take appropriate action should any student be seriously affected by these actions - which could include compensation.\n\"We fully believe in protecting academic freedom but universities have a duty to maintain access to good-quality tuition as a priority, especially given the disruption the pandemic has caused students already.\" \nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was \"half tempted to say you should be lucky not to be taught by such a useless bunch\".\nHe suggested the academics had not \"bothered to look up the history of Rhodes in any detail\", describing him as a \"figure of importance and of interest and of enormous generosity to Oxford\". \n\"We must not allow this wokeness to happen,\" he added.\nLord Wharton, chair of the Office for Students, said: \"Oriel College took a decision to retain the Rhodes statue after carefully considering all of the evidence.\n\"It would be utterly unacceptable if any 'boycott' of Oriel led to students, or prospective students, at the college being disadvantaged in any way.\"\nUniversities minister Michelle Donelan said: \"We fully believe in protecting academic freedom, but universities have a duty to maintain access to good quality tuition as a priority - especially given the disruption the pandemic has caused students.\"\nRegarding the Rhodes statue, she said universities \"make their own decisions as autonomous institutions but our position is that a retain-and-explain policy is always best\".\nThere have been some creative ideas of what to do with controversial statues, if they are removed.\nSome have suggested just leaving the space empty, while sculptor Antony Gormley proposed turning the Rhodes statue to face the wall. \nRobert Gildea, one of the academics to sign up to the boycott, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was a way of putting pressure on the college after alternative attempts had not worked.\nThe professor emeritus of modern history at Oxford University said taking no action was \"not acceptable\".\nHe added: \"If the college put up a notice explaining who Cecil Rhodes was that would be fine, if the college put a placard round his neck at lunchtime today saying 'sorry' that would also be fine.\"\nA graffitied statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, that was toppled during a Black Lives Matter protest last year, is now on display at a museum.\nAny decision to remove the Rhodes statue would require listed building consent from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government.\nIn a statement, the college said it had undertaken \"an extensive, academic and rigorous process advised by a 10-month long independent commission of inquiry\".\nIt added: \"The commission did not make a recommendation on the removal of memorials.\n\"We note with sadness that some fellow academics from other colleges at Oxford University have chosen not to respect the decisions of our governing body, not least because of the commensurate impact on our students and the wider academic community at Oriel, to whom we all have a duty of care.\"\nProf Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, said: \"Oxford's brilliant academics are rightly renowned for their dedication to teaching, so I am deeply disappointed that some of my colleagues would choose to punish students, and prospective students, for the actions of their college's governing body, especially after the prolonged disruption of teaching during the pandemic.\" "

      "text": "Hackers have stolen valuable information from major game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), the company said.\nThe attackers claimed to have downloaded source code for games such as FIFA 21 and for the proprietary Frostbite game engine used as the base for many other high-profile games.\nNews of the hack was first reported by news site Vice, which said some 780GB of data was stolen.\nEA said no player data had been stolen in the breach.\nThe firm is one of the largest games companies in the world. It counts major series such as Battlefield, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, The Sims, and Titanfall among the titles it develops or publishes - as well as a vast array of annual sports games.\n\"We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,\" an EA spokesperson said in a statement.\n\"No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy,\" she added.\nThe company said it had already improved security and stated that it did not expect \"an impact on our games or our business\".\nLaw enforcement has also been contacted.\nThe \"network intrusion\" was not a ransomware attack and had happened recently, EA added.\nIn its report, Vice said it had seen screenshots of the hacking forums used by the attackers, who are advertising the stolen data for sale.\nSource code is a version of computer software which is usually much easier to read and understand than the end version in a finished product, and could be used to reverse engineer parts of the product.\nFor example, the Frostbite engine, which hackers claim to have the source code for, is a powerful game creation tool used in dozens of games, from FIFA to the Battlefield series and several recent Star Wars games from EA.\nThe source code for the engine could hold significant value for an unscrupulous developer willing to copy it, or for those making cheat codes and hacks for games.\nBut it is unlikely that any mainstream competitor to EA would ever use such stolen data.\nIt is the latest in a string of high-profile gaming company hacks.\nIn November last year, Capcom, the maker of Street Fighter and Resident Evil, suffered a ransomware attack which may have revealed the personal information of up to 350,000 people.\nAnd in February, Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red suffered another ransomware attack which resulted in the source code for several games being stolen and auctioned off online.\nIn that case, the hackers claimed to have sold the data for more than $7m (\u00a34.9m), though it is not clear if the sale actually happened."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,David Frost,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU says its patience is \"wearing very thin\" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war.\nTop EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit \"divorce\" settlement.\nThe UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation.\nBoris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was \"easily doable\".\nAnd he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was \"not worried\" it would overshadow the G7 summit.\nThe prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have \"deep\" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland.\nAsked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be \"absolutely clear\" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to \"uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland\".\nHe said he was \"optimistic\" a solution could be found that \"protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom\". \nTalks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement.\nMr Sefcovic said he was \"positive we can find a solution\" but added: \"Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal.\"\nThis could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained.\nHe said \"trust\" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol.\nA key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nGreat Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nEU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules.\nIn January, the two sides agreed a six month \"grace\" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June.\nThe UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and to begin legal proceedings.\nMr Sefcovic said: \"If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations.\"\nA UK source close to the negotiations said: \"Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it.\"\nIt was \"much better to find agreed ways forward\", added the source, and \"the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats\".\n\"But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats.\"\nAsked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said \"we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open.\"\nThere's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. \nThe EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. \nThe British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to \"Get Brexit Done\". \nBut those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland.  \nDuring the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be.\nNow his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. \nThe practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. \nThe EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. \nBoth sides talk about \"considering all our options\" if a compromise can't be found. \nIn public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. \nMr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards.\n\"Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,\" he added.\nSpeaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was \"being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation\".\n\"There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,\" he added.\n\"What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal.\"\nLord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides \"operate the protocol in an extremely purist way\" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats.\n\"We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB.\"\nNorthern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to \"honour its commitments\" on the Brexit protocol.\n\"Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,\" she added."

      "title": "Covid: Matt Hancock defends timing of first lockdown",
      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has sought to justify the timing of the first national Covid lockdown after claims a delay cost thousands of lives.\nHe told MPs locking down earlier than 23 March 2020 would have gone against the scientific advice at the time.\nMinisters did challenge the scientists, he insisted, but overruling their advice would have been \"much harder\".\nHe denied claims by Dominic Cummings at the same committee two weeks ago about his handling of the pandemic.\nHe rejected Mr Cummings's criticisms - including that he had lied to Prime Minister Boris Johnson about care home testing - and gave a very different version of events to that set out by the PM's former aide.\nAfter his appearance, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said Mr Hancock \"blames everyone but himself and the government for the handling of the pandemic\".\nMr Hancock told the MPs he \"bitterly regretted\" not pushing back harder against initial scientific advice that Covid was unlikely to spread asymptomatically. \nThis assumption was a big reason, he said, why the government advice on routinely testing hospital patients before they were discharged into care homes did not change until April.\nWhen pressed that government scientists had concluded on 28 January \"early indications\" implied asymptomatic transmission, he maintained the \"recommendation for policy advice\" at that point was that it was unlikely. \nHe said he had asked scientists in January to look into evidence from China that the virus could transmit in this way - but was told during a World Health Organization call this was \"highly likely\" to have been down to \"translation issues\".\nHe added he had an \"instinct\" the advice was wrong, but said it was hard to overturn this when \"you don't have the evidence that you're right, and the scientific consensus is wrong\".\nRegrets? Matt Hancock has a few. \nSuch as not challenging the assumption within Whitehall early last year that the public wouldn't tolerate a lockdown to contain Covid. \nHe \"bitterly regretted\" that he had not overruled scientific advice at the start of the pandemic that assumed coronavirus could not be transmitted asymptomatically. \nMr Hancock said the death rate in care homes \"weighed heavily\" on him. \nBut over four and half hours the health secretary defended the government's actions on several fronts - from PPE provision to care homes - making claims that will be scrutinised further. \nDominic Cummings sat in the same chair two weeks ago and heaped scorn on blame on his former colleagues (most venomously on Mr Hancock). \nIn contrast, the health secretary said ministers and officials largely did their best in unprecedented circumstances. \nMr Hancock strenuously avoided mentioning Mr Cummings by name but swatted away his allegations when they were put to him by MPs. \nWhile assiduously praising those he worked with Matt Hancock also gave the impression that what the crisis really needed was more Matt Hancock. \nAfter having his name trashed by Mr Cummings a fortnight ago this was quite a bounce back. \nMatt Hancock ended his evidence saying the government was now better prepared to handle another pandemic. \nIt had better be because Mr Hancock's testimony added to the picture of a government stunned, sometimes inert and often overwhelmed as the Covid crisis engulfed it at the start of last year.\nTwo weeks ago, Mr Cummings had told the committee that delays to lockdowns and mistakes by Mr Hancock and others had needlessly cost \"tens of thousands\" of lives. \nFormer government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson has said deaths in the UK would have been halved if the first lockdown had been introduced a week earlier.\nQuizzed by MPs on the decisions that led up to the first lockdown, the health secretary said he had instructed the NHS to plan on a \"reasonable worst case\" basis, from January, that 820,000 people could die from Covid.\nBut it was not until 9 March that data \"started to follow\" this trajectory, and not until a week later that \"updated modelling\" showed the UK was broadly on track to meet it.\nThe public was told to avoid non-essential social contact on 16 March, with a full UK-wide national lockdown introduced on 23 March. \nAsked why a lockdown was not implemented earlier, he said: \"The clear advice at the time was there was only a limited period that people would put up with lockdown.\"\nHe added: \"That proved to be wrong.\"\n\"Challenging the advice is one thing, but overruling a scientific consensus is much harder, especially when the costs of the lockdown of the lockdown are immediate and are obvious,\" Mr Hancock told the committee.\nMr Hancock also said he had known Mr Cummings wanted the PM to fire him last year, claiming the ex-aide had \"briefed the newspapers at the time.\"\nAnd in a swipe at the PM's former aide, he said government had \"operated better\" since his departure from Downing Street in December. \nDefending the government's initial advice that all hospital patients did not need to be repeatedly tested before being sent to care homes, he said ministers had \"followed the clinical advice\" at all times.\nHe said clinicians at the time were worried about people picking up Covid in hospital while they waited for test results and false negatives from patients without symptoms providing \"false assurance\". \nBut Labour's shadow care minister Liz Kendall accused Mr Hancock of \"selectively\" quoting clinical advice \"instead of admitting his abject failure to protect care homes\".\n\"He has now used multiple excuses for failing to test those discharged to care,\" she said. \nThe health secretary was giving evidence to the Commons health and science committees, as part of their joint inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.\nThe committees asked Mr Cummings to provide documents to back up his allegations about Mr Hancock. \nAsked by a reporter waiting outside his home when he would produce this material, Mr Cummings said: \"I'm dealing with a TV repair van, I'm afraid.\""

      "tags": "France,Emmanuel Macron",
      "text": "A medieval combat enthusiast has been given four months in jail after he admitted slapping French President Emmanuel Macron.\nDamien Tarel told the court it was an act of impulse, but the prosecutor said it was a \"deliberate act of violence\".\nThe court heard that Tarel subscribed to right-wing or far-right politics and was close to the yellow-vest movement.\nPresident Macron said the attack should not be trivialised but had to be kept in proportion.\nHe had just left a hotel school in the south-eastern town of Tain-l'Hermitage when he ran towards a crowd waiting behind a metal barrier. \nAs he slapped the president, Tarel was heard to shout \"Montjoie and Saint-Denis! Down with Macronism\", using an obscure medieval battle-cry.\nThe incident was immediately condemned across France's political spectrum, less than a year before presidential elections.\nProsecutors had called for 18 months in prison for assaulting a public official. The three judges said Tarel should be given 18 months, with 14 months of the sentence suspended. His four months in jail will start immediately but the rest will only be enforced if he commits another offence.\nA second suspect who filmed the incident is facing prosecution for illegal possession of weapons after local authorities searched his home. He comes from the same town as Damien Tarel.\nAccording to AFP news agency, the defendant appeared in court in Valence wearing the same green T-shirt he wore on the day of his arrest.\nAsked why he had attacked the president, he replied that while waiting with his friends in the car beforehand he had considered doing something notable. He had earlier considered throwing an egg or cream tart, but insisted he had not considered slapping Mr Macron.\n\"When I saw his friendly, lying look, which sought me out as a voter, I was filled with disgust,\" he was reported as saying to the court.\nCondemning the president's politics, he added that he felt he was part of the anti-establishment gilets jaunes (yellow-vests) movement, which staged anti-Macron protests during the early years of his presidency. \"I acted instinctively,\" he claimed.\nFriends had earlier described Tarel as apolitical and Le Parisien had quoted one source who summed up his politics as \"ideological mush\". His Instagram page described him as a historic European martial arts enthusiast, complete with sword and armour. \nHis battle-cry is perhaps better known nowadays for its use in a 1993 French comedy film called Les Visiteurs.\nThe French president had earlier dismissed the assault as isolated, while emphasising that \"ultra-violent people\" should not be allowed to hijack public debate.\nIn a news conference on Thursday ahead of France's involvement in the European football championships, he went further. \n\"There have been moments of very high tension and violence in our country which I've had to experience as president, during the gilets jaunes crisis. But society is in a different place today.\"\nHe said he had decided not to take legal action himself, preferring to leave it to the judicial system."

      "tags": "Elton John,Live music,Brexit,Music",
      "text": "Sir Elton John has warned MPs that the UK music industry could lose \"a generation of talent\" because of post-Brexit restrictions on touring the EU.\nThe musician accused ministers of being unwilling to fix a \"gaping hole\" in the current Brexit deal which means artists need costly visas to play in the bloc.\nThe government says the EU rejected its attempts to negotiate visa-free travel, while the EU claims the opposite.\nSir Elton called the situation a \"looming catastrophe\" for the UK.\n\"I want to be clear that the issues of visa-free and permit-free touring aren't about the impact on me, and artists who tour arenas and stadiums,\" he said. \n\"This gravest of situations is about the damage to the next generation of musicians and emerging artists, whose careers will stall before they've even started due to this infuriating blame game. \n\"If I had faced the financial and logistical obstacles facing young musicians now when I started out, I'd never have had the opportunity to build the foundations of my career and I very much doubt I would be where I am today.\"\nThe star's statement was read to MPs during a hearing by the Digital, Culture, Media (DCMS) and Sport Committee on EU visa arrangements for those in the creative industries. Sir Elton later posted the letter in full on Instagram.\nThe DCMS committee was also due to hear from Brexit Minister Lord Frost - but he pulled out unexpectedly, drawing fierce criticism from committee chairman Julian Knight.\n\"Parliamentary scrutiny in front of select committees is of crucial importance in our democratic system and is particularly important when we have a government with a majority of over 80,\" he said in a statement, calling Lord Frost's failure to attend the hearing unacceptable.\n\"I, and this committee, look forward to Lord Frost joining us at the rearranged date and we will not truck any further cancellation.\"\nHowever, the committee did hear from live music agent and promoter Craig Stanley, who warned that the UK's live music industry \"is facing annihilation\".\nHe noted that the majority of European tours by pop and rock bands originate in the UK - meaning they employ stage crew, drivers, caterers, sound engineers, lighting technicians and backing musicians to work across the 27 EU member states.\n\"American acts when they come over, the vast majority of the time, take on British staff and use British equipment 85 to 90% of the time,\" he told MPs. \"They will start to move to Schiphol, to Frankfurt, to warehouses in the middle of Germany, and take on the gear there, and all of that will be lost.\"\nHe added that there was a \"real danger\" British orchestras may have to stop touring internationally. \nThey not only face visa requirements, but new limits on road haulage - which mean trucks transporting instruments from the UK must return home after visiting two EU member states.\n\"They can't just put their very, very expensive and delicate instruments into any truck,\" Stanley explained. \n\"If they can't drive it [themselves], they can't tour. So you're going to stop the Royal Philharmonic from touring. It's as bold as that.\"\nThe government was previously accused of treating live music as \"an afterthought\" in Brexit negotiations compared with the much smaller \u00a31.2bn fishing industry. \nCulture Minister Caroline Dinenage rejected that characterisation, saying: \"No, I wouldn't accept that. This is something that's huge for our economy. It's an international calling card for us.\"\nA UK government spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday: \"We want musicians and others to be able to tour easily both inside and outside the EU.\n\"Short-term, temporary visits for paid performances by UK musicians are possible in at least 17 EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, without needing visas or work permits.\"\nHowever, Noel McClean, leader of the entertainment union Bectu, told the DCMS committee there are still \"varying degrees of bureaucracy still associated with those 17 member states\".\nThe government's statement does not \"quite match up to the expectation that you can do what you could before\", he added.\nAnother rock star, Noel Gallagher, echoed those sentiments when talking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row on Thursday, saying his European touring plans will now have to be scaled down.\n\"You can't just get on a train and go to Paris and do a gig [anymore],\" the former Oasis singer-songwriter said.\n\"You've got to apply to do a gig and you've got to declare what equipment you're bringing.\n\"And that's things that never cost us any money two or three years ago, which is going to cost a fortune.\"\nHe continued: \"So I just think, ultimately, like most things, the fans are going to lose out because instead of bands going to Europe for four weeks now and doing three gigs in Germany, there'll be one. And there will be one in France, and one in Spain, and one in Belgium, and then it'll be a whistlestop, scaled-down show.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Joe Biden has \"deep\" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland, his national security adviser has told the BBC.\nThe US president will tell fellow leaders at this week's G7 summit that gains since the Good Friday Agreement must be protected, Jake Sullivan said.\nThe UK and EU are at loggerheads over checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nIf no compromise is reached, there are fears of potential violence in NI.\nMr Sullivan's comments also come as the UK is trying to secure a free-trade deal with the US.\nHe insisted he was not trying to \"negotiate in public\" or issue a \"warning\" to Boris Johnson's government, but merely stating \"how the president feels about this issue\".\nThe UK and EU are in talks over simplifying the Northern Ireland Protocol, which set up a post-Brexit trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border.\nSome checks are taking place on British goods going to Northern Ireland, causing some disruption to food supplies and online deliveries.\nUnionists are strongly opposed to these because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nSinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its \"rigorous implementation\".\nOne loyalist group has written to Mr Johnson to withdraw support for the Good Friday Agreement - signed in 1998 following heavy involvement by the US - which helped bring an end to the Troubles.\nIn an interview with BBC North America editor Jon Sopel, Mr Sullivan said the success or failure of the Northern Ireland Protocol was \"critical to ensuring that the spirit, promise and future of the Good Friday Agreement is protected\".\nHe urged the UK and EU to \"work out the specifics\" and \"find a way to proceed that works for both\", adding: \"But whatever way they find to proceed must at its core fundamentally protect the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and not imperil that.\"\nThat was the \"message President Biden will send\" at the G7 summit, which runs from Friday to Sunday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, Mr Sullivan said.\nThe conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles lasted almost 30 years from the late 1960s, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people.\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921 and remained part of the UK, while the rest of Ireland became an independent state.\nThis created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestants and were happy to stay in the UK - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholics and wanted to join the new Irish state.\nMany Catholics faced discrimination in jobs and housing and in the late 1960s began protests which were met with a crackdown from the Northern Ireland government.\nIn 1969, after violence across Northern Ireland, the UK government deployed troops to restore public order.\nThey were largely welcomed, but later armed groups from both sides, like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), began carrying out bombings and shootings.\nPeace talks started in the early 1990s, and culminated in the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which ended the worst of the violence. \nIssues including climate change and post-pandemic recovery are set to dominate the meeting of leaders of most of the world's biggest economies.\nThe G7 summit also comes as the UK is keen to reach free-trade deals with other countries, including the US, as it readjusts its economy following Brexit.\n\"I'm not intending to send any warnings,\" Mr Sullivan said.\nBut he added: \"Our concern [on Northern Ireland] does run deep. That is simply a statement of principle. That's how the president feels about this issue.\n\"What it does to a US-UK free-trade agreement, I don't want to sit here and negotiate in public... or make some claim or threat,\" Mr Sullivan said.\n\"We want to make sure that the work that the US, UK, and Ireland have all done, in addition to the key parties in NI, has got to be honoured and respected and protected as we go forward,\" he added.\nA senior UK government source said the government was \"positive\" about President Biden's engagement with Northern Ireland and the peace process, saying: \"We welcome the balanced tone from the US.\"\nJake Sullivan was very keen to impress upon me that, if the administration were a rock-'n'-roll band, this would be the \"America is back\" tour.\nHe wants the world to know that the isolationist, poke-your-allies-in-the-eye Trump years are gone, that the familiar, multilateral America is returning.\nMr Sullivan argues that on climate change, the global economy and leading the world out of the pandemic, the US will play a leading role.\nThis will be welcomed by the other G7 nations after the bumpiness that came with his predecessor. But Mr Sullivan is aware that will be met with some scepticism too.\nAfter the scarring events of 6 January, when Washington's Capitol building was stormed, how can America be the role model of functioning liberal democracy? How reliable a partner will it be? Could the go-it-alone America re-emerge in four years' time? \nThe UK has pushed back the full implementation of checks on supermarket goods and parcels travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland to ease disruption to supplies.\nThis has prompted the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the Northern Ireland Protocol and begin legal action.\nThe next phase of controls, on chilled meat products including sausages and mince, is due to begin on 1 July.\nThe UK's Brexit minister, Lord Frost, is meeting his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in London to discuss ways to reduce trade disruption.\nHe has urged the EU to show \"common sense\", but Mr Sefcovic has warned against \"quick fixes\" to border issues."

      "tags": "Companies,Clothing industry,Retailing,Asos,Boohoo",
      "text": "Nearly half of of women's clothes for sale on some of the leading online websites are made entirely from new plastics, according to a study.  \nThe research by the charity the Royal Society for the Arts (RSA) looked at 10,000 items being sold by  Boohoo, Prettylittlething, Missguided and Asos. \nIt found on average 49% were made of polyester, acrylic, nylon and elastane. \nThe RSA said the numbers varied by outlet with Asos using comparatively less new plastic than the others.\nThe study found that 60% of Boohoo's women's clothing and 57% of Boohoo-owned Prettylittlething's were made entirely from new plastics.\nMissguided had 42% of its items made entirely from new plastics and Asos 36%. \nThe RSA also said that the study found that on average, just 3% of clothes which contained any plastics used recycled plastics - \"although this rises to 6% among items from Asos\".\nMissguided's head of sourcing and product technology Paul Smith said the company was \"proud of the progress it had made\" and that all its own brand products were packaged and despatched in 100% recycled plastic. However, it added: \"We agree there's more to do.\"\nThe company said it had \"committed to making sure 10% of our products will use recycled fibres by the end of 2021 and 25% by the end of 2022\".\nAsos said the figures reflected positively on it, but like the rest of the industry it recognised more needed to be done.\nThe study for the report Fast Fashion's Plastic Problem, was carried out between 11 and 29 May. The researchers looked at more than 2,500 recently added items from each website, spread across different product categories.\nThe RSA said the plastic used large amounts of energy and created environmental damage in their production and could take thousands of years to break down.\nIt added that a \"throwaway culture\", meant that \"the bulk of these garments are ending up in landfill\".\n\"The sheer volume of clothing produced by these websites is shocking - we should see many of these items, which go for rock-bottom prices, as akin to other short-lived plastics. The nature of fast fashion trends means they are not designed to have long lives in our wardrobes,\" said the report's co-author Josie Warden.\nThe RSA is calling for action to cut down on the use of plastic in fashion items. \nIt wants to government to look at introducing a plastics tax on clothes imported into or produced in the UK.\nIt says websites should come  up with ways of promoting second-hand clothing, \"along the lines of Depop and Asos' marketplace\" and to publish figures on how much plastic they use.\nAnd it is encouraging consumers to buy less and keep clothes for longer, rather than only wearing garments a \"handful of times\". \nAsos, said its prices were not at \"throwaway\" levels and disputed the report's description of it as a fast-fashion retailer. \nIt pointed out it does publish information about fabrics and their care, including on a new page on its website about how to care for clothes in a more environmentally-friendly way.\nIt said it is encouraging that the RSA figures reflected positively on it because shifting to more sustainable materials was a key element of its Fashion With Integrity programme.\nHowever, it said like the rest of the industry it recognised there was much more work to do and that it was continually reviewing and developing programmes to minimise its impact on people and the planet.\nBoohoo has published its Up Front strategy which sets an \"ambitious\" goal of all polyester and cotton being recycled or more sustainable for 2025.\nHowever, the RSA report said the company had a \"mountain to climb\" to meet this target. \nBoohoo said: \"Solutions to these complex challenges require collaboration which is why we are delighted with the response from our existing and new suppliers to help us identify innovative solutions to achieve this target,\" a spokesperson said.\nBoohoo is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and a signatory of Textiles 2030.\n\"We've engaged with our customers extensively through focus groups and a recent survey, that received over 14,500 responses, to understand their attitudes to textile waste,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"What they tell us is that the price they pay does not determine how long they keep an item of clothing and 88% said that they use either charity shops or resale sites as a responsible form of disposal, throwing an item away is an absolute last resort for them.\""

      "tags": "Human rights,Employment tribunals,LGBT,Transgender people",
      "text": "A woman who lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex has won an appeal against an employment tribunal.\nMaya Forstater, 47, did not have her contract renewed after posting tweets on gender recognition.\nShe lost her original case at a tribunal in 2019, but a High Court judge ruled her \"gender-critical\" beliefs fell under the Equalities Act.\nThe appeal said the tribunal had erred in law and another should take place.\nMs Forstater, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, did not have her contract renewed at the think tank Center for Global Development (CGD) in March 2019, after posting a series of tweets questioning government plans - which were later scrapped - to let people declare their own gender.\nShe claimed she was discriminated against because of her beliefs, which include \"that sex is immutable and not to be conflated with gender identity\".\nIn the initial tribunal employment judge James Tayler said that her approach was \"not worthy of respect in a democratic society\".\nHe concluded that Ms Forstater was \"absolutist\" in her view and said she was not entitled to ignore the rights of a transgender person and the \"enormous pain that can be caused by misgendering\".\nBut the Honourable Mr Justice Choudhury said her \"gender-critical beliefs\" did fall under the Equalities Act as they \"did not seek to destroy the rights of trans persons\".\nMs Forstater said she was \"delighted to have been vindicated\" but CGD said the decision was a \"step backwards for inclusivity and equality for all\".\nIn a video statement, Ms Forstater said: \"I'm proud of the role I've played in clarifying the law and encouraging more people to speak up\". \nAmanda Glassman, executive vice president of CGD, said: \"The decision is disappointing and surprising because we believe Judge Tayler got it right when he found this type of offensive speech causes harm to trans people, and therefore could not be protected under the Equality Act. \n\"Today's decision is a step backwards for inclusivity and equality for all.\"\nMaya Forstater won her case because the Employment Appeal Tribunal concluded that her belief that biological sex is real, important and immutable met the legal test of a genuine and important philosophical position that is protected under the UK's equality laws. \nThe test for such a protection was that her belief touched on an important part of human life, would be accepted by others and - this is the important bit - could not be shown to be a direct attempt to harm others. \nThe appeal panel found that while her words were offensive to some, they fell far short of the violent and oppressive views of \"Nazism or totalitarian\". There was not even any evidence that she had harassed anyone at work. \nWhere does this leave employers? Equality and employment law require them to recognise and uphold the rights of all in the workplace. \nMs Forstater's speech and beliefs are protected - but so are the rights of trans people. And if speech crosses the line from an honestly held belief to bullying, attacks and intimidation, then the scales very obviously tip in favour of protecting the victim. \nMr Justice Choudhury acknowledged that some transgender people would be disappointed by this judgement, but said it had not \"expressed any view on the merits of either side of the transgender debate\".\nThe judgement does not mean \"that those with gender-critical beliefs can 'misgender' trans persons with impunity\", he added. \nAnd he said it does not mean \"that employers and service providers will not be able to provide a safe environment for trans persons\".\nCGD said it was considering various paths forward with its lawyers and said it disputed Ms Forstater's version of events.\nThe sole issue considered by the appeal tribunal was whether the original tribunal had been wrong not to consider Ms Forstater's views as a philosophical belief protected by the Equality Act.\nOther matters of the case, such as her employment status or whether she was discriminated against, would have to be decided at a fresh tribunal.\nBaroness Falkner, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said there was a difference between holding a belief and how it was expressed.\nShe said: \"Some may see the beliefs of others as questionable or controversial, but people must be free to hold them.\n\"This is why this case is so important.\" \nMonica Kurnatowska, employment partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said the ruling meant that \"individuals are entitled not to be discriminated against because of gender critical beliefs... and gives those beliefs the same legal protection as religious beliefs, environmental beliefs and ethical veganism\".\n\"Employers will be watching closely for any guidance on how to handle employee conflict fairly and lawfully, while respecting the rights of all involved,\" she added.\nLui Asquith, director of legal and policy at Mermaids, a charity that supports transgender, non-binary and gender-diverse children and young people, said: \"This is not the win anti-trans campaigners will suggest in the coming days. \n\"We, as trans people, are protected by equality law and this decision in the Maya Forstater case does not give anyone the right to unlawfully harass, intimidate, abuse or discriminate against us because we are trans.\"\nMs Forstater's case gained public attention, including some high-profile supporters such as Harry Potter author JK Rowling and presenter Jonathan Ross."

      "text": "Opposition MPs have called on the home secretary to resign after documents suggested she misled Parliament over her decision to house asylum seekers at Kent's controversial Napier Barracks.\nHealth officials, inspectors and a High Court judge have examined concerns dormitory use led to a Covid outbreak. \nPriti Patel said in February that \"use of the accommodation was all based on Public Health England (PHE) advice\". \nHowever, a Home Office email said PHE advice viewed dorms as unsuitable.\nAmid calls in the Commons for Ms Patel to resign, SNP MP Joanna Cherry said: \"What she said - that the department had previously followed public health guidance regarding Napier Barracks in every single way - was simply not factually correct.\"\nShe asked: \"Why isn't the home secretary tendering her resignation as Amber Rudd (the former home secretary) had the grace and decency to do?\"\nHome Office minister Chris Philp said the department followed PHE guidelines \"where possible\".\nA Home Office email from last September said: \"Public health advice is just that - we don't have to follow it, but should we choose not to and then have an outbreak of Covid, the fallout would be significant.\"\nIt said: \"Their advice is that dormitories are not suitable.\"\nDocuments published by the Home Affairs Committee showed how the Home Office detailed specifications in September and said \"dormitories which can be adapted to be Covid-19 compliant are acceptable\".\nHowever, a note from a PHE official at the time said: \"I don't know how dormitories can be Covid-compliant.\"\nThree months later, further PHE guidance sent to the Home Office said: \"All guests (asylum seekers in Home Office accommodation) should be treated as potentially infectious. They should have individual rooms with en-suite to avoid need to leave the room.\"\nBut in February, Ms Patel told MPs that PHE and local authorities gave guidance which her department had been following \"in every single way\".\nFollowing questions from the BBC, the Home Office provided further background information on why the home secretary told MPs she was following PHE guidance \"in every single way\" when using dormitories at Napier Barracks.\n\"While the advice to officials from PHE was that dormitory style accommodation was not suitable,\" a spokesman confirms, \"it also set out how congregate residential settings should be used if other accommodation is not available\".\n\"We believed we were taking reasonable steps to give effect to the PHE advice as to the steps that should be taken to make dormitory accommodation as safe as possible.\"  \nThe Home Office also states that throughout the setup and operation of the site, it has engaged with health officials to ensure it is fully aware of the most thorough and up-to-date advice and continues to make improvements to ensure the safety of those in asylum accommodation.\nIn the High Court in April, a witness statement by a senior Home Office official said: \"Health agencies continue to have serious reservations about use of the site.\"\nIn the statement, Philomena Creffield quoted an unnamed health official and said \"she/he has not been provided with evidence that Napier now provides a Covid-safe environment\".\nThe official was said to have warned the Home Office \"that the accommodation and configuration of Napier is not in line with the guidance and that another outbreak is inevitable\".\nMs Creffield's statement accepted \"congregate or communal settings give rise to an increased risk of transmission of Covid-19\" but said, rather than close the accommodation, the Home Office was \"working towards taking steps to improve our processes in terms of identifying and managing any outbreak\".\nHundreds of men were housed at the disused barracks, as the Home Office faced an urgent need to accommodate asylum seekers arriving in boats across the Channel.\nAs the pandemic raged, up to 20 asylum seekers slept in dormitories with sheets separating beds.  \nIn January, nearly 200 men caught Covid-19 in an outbreak at the site.\nLast week, the High Court ruled the decision to house asylum seekers at Napier was unlawful, however the Home Office said the site would continue to operate.\nMany residents were moved out in April, but lawyers said the number of residents has since gone back up to more than 265, with men sleeping in dormitories of up to 12."

      "text": "The EU says its patience is \"wearing very thin\" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war.\nTop EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit \"divorce\" settlement.\nThe UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation.\nBoris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was \"easily doable\".\nAnd he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was \"not worried\" it would overshadow the G7 summit.\nThe prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have \"deep\" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland.\nAsked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be \"absolutely clear\" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to \"uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland\".\nHe said he was \"optimistic\" a solution could be found that \"protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom\". \nTalks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement.\nMr Sefcovic said he was \"positive we can find a solution\" but added: \"Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal.\"\nThis could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained.\nHe said \"trust\" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol.\nA key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nGreat Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nEU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules.\nIn January, the two sides agreed a six month \"grace\" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June.\nThe UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and to begin legal proceedings.\nMr Sefcovic said: \"If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations.\"\nA UK source close to the negotiations said: \"Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it.\"\nIt was \"much better to find agreed ways forward\", added the source, and \"the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats\".\n\"But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats.\"\nAsked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said \"we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open.\"\nThere's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. \nThe EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. \nThe British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to \"Get Brexit Done\". \nBut those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland.  \nDuring the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be.\nNow his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. \nThe practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. \nThe EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. \nBoth sides talk about \"considering all our options\" if a compromise can't be found. \nIn public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. \nMr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards.\n\"Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,\" he added.\nSpeaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was \"being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation\".\n\"There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,\" he added.\n\"What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal.\"\nLord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides \"operate the protocol in an extremely purist way\" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats.\n\"We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB.\"\nNorthern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to \"honour its commitments\" on the Brexit protocol.\n\"Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,\" she added."

      "text": "\"Normality, as we knew it in 2019, is still some way off,\" the health minister has said. \nThe remarks by Robin Swann were in a briefing document from the Department of Health to the NI Executive. \nMr Swann said Northern Ireland is \"not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing\".\nThe health paper also said testing for coronavirus over the past few days has indicated that up to 25% of new cases here may be the Delta variant. \nThe document warns of another possible \"significant fresh surge\" of positive cases and hospitalisations by late summer or early autumn. \nIt says the Delta variant, which originated in India, is more transmissible, and is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission.\nVaccination is working, it states, and \"the more people we can get fully vaccinated the stronger our protection will be\".\nThe Public Health Agency has said 111 probable and confirmed cases of the Delta variant have been detected throughout all 11 local council areas in Northern Ireland, 28 of them are in Kilkeel.\nCases of the variant were first confirmed in Northern Ireland in early May.\nThe NI Executive met on Thursday to discuss further relaxations of Covid restrictions.\nMr Swann said while the number of Delta cases remained small, there were \"grounds for concern\", and evidence from Great Britain showed its potential to spread quickly. \nThe use of face coverings was also expected to continue, he said. \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there was cause for \"worry\". \n\"We're naturally worried whenever we look at predictions and modelling for what could potentially happen,\" she said.  \n\"Some of the modelling suggests we will have a significant rise in positive cases.\"\nMs O'Neill said Chief Medical officer Dr Michael McBride said there should be clearer picture by mid July. \nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the Delta variant is more transmissible and \"we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens\". \nStormont ministers have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music to resume across venues in NI. \nHowever, it will need to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. \nNo live music is permitted in pubs, hotels and clubs under current Covid-19 regulations, with many venues closed to audiences since March 2020.\nIt is understood the Executive also agreed proposals to raise limits on social contact at home from 21 June.\nThis would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home.\nThe number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date.\n21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment.\nAlong with the other proposals on rules regarding live music in licensed and unlicensed venues, the changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer.\nTheatres may also be set to reopen on 21 June, if the executive gives the green light next week.\nQueen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford has said delaying the easing of restrictions may \"put us in better stead going into the coming months\".\nHe said some modelling of the new Delta variant suggested its spread could result in a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths, despite a large portion of the adult population being vaccinated.\n\"There are still a lot of people at risk, without vaccines, with one dose of vaccine, and this is, of course, more transmissible,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"I think that possibly delaying the relief of these restrictions might be the best thing to do in the next couple of weeks, until we have more information and more time for that public health acting to act and also to get more people with two-dose vaccinations.\"\nLiam McFeely, singer with The Goodfellas, one of the north west's best-known wedding bands, said it was vital the return of live music got the go-ahead.\n\"People are on aeroplanes, they are in cinemas tonight, which is fantastic, but still no dancing, no signing, no music,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"For some reason, for music and entertainment there was no happy medium, it was just stop, no dancing,\" he said.\nMusicians, he added, have endured an \"absolutely brutal, horrendous\" time since March 2020. He estimated lockdown cost him \"thousands of pounds\" in lost earnings.\n\"We lost 60 weddings in three weeks, that's my livelihood, that was the beginning,\" he said.\n\"You keep things for a rainy day but when you have three kids at uni, the rainy days are every day\".\nThursday's executive meeting was also Arlene Foster's last as Northern Ireland's first minister, as she prepares to step down.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons are also due to leave their posts, as DUP leader Edwin Poots prepares to move his new team into office.\nOn Wednesday, the incoming Economy Minister Paul Frew said he wanted to see a \"stocktake\" of the coronavirus restrictions.\nHe said: \"There are some restrictions that are still in place and have been in place over the past month that are not logical.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,G7 summits,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson says the UK will start donating coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks.\nMore than 100 million surplus doses will be delivered in the next year, he announced ahead of the G7 summit.\nUS President Joe Biden has promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union.\nFive million doses will be given by the UK by the end of September, with 25 million more by the end of the year.\nThe prime minister said: \"As a result of the success of the UK's vaccine programme we are now in a position to share some of our surplus doses with those who need them.\n\"In doing so we will take a massive step towards beating this pandemic for good.\"\nHe said he hoped his fellow leaders at the summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, which starts on Friday, would \"make similar pledges so that, together, we can vaccinate the world by the end of next year\". \nThe group of leaders of wealthy nations is expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of coronavirus vaccines in a collective effort to end the pandemic. \nThe leaders of Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy as well as the US and the UK, are also setting out a plan to expand vaccine manufacturing to help hit that goal.  \nSpeaking in Cornwall, Mr Biden said: \"The United States is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached. No strings attached.\n\"Our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions. We're doing this to save lives.\"\nIt is not the first contribution to global vaccination by the UK government - it has already donated more than \u00a3500m to Covax, the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest countries.\nAnd it helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is available at cost price - with two-thirds of the 400m doses going to low and middle-income countries, including 170m to India. \nMr Johnson wants the G7 leaders to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to also provide vaccines at cost price, while the pandemic continues. \nAbout a fifth of the doses being donated by the UK will be delivered through specific agreements with countries in need, with the rest being donated through Covax. \nSpeaking to the BBC, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi agreed that even with the G7 donation pledges \"fundamentally, there's a shortage\" to vaccinate everyone and called on manufacturers to scale up production across the world. \nHe also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global effort.\nHe added that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June.\nThe government has ordered more than 500m doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIt is hoped that the surplus doses of vaccine could help prevent the spread of the virus around the world and in doing so, restrict the emergence of more new variants. \nThe donations announcement comes after the UK went back on a commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, instead cutting that to 0.5%, citing the pandemic's effect on public finances.\nThe donation of vaccines will count as extra aid spending on top of the \u00a310bn promised under the reduced target.\nZoe Abrams, executive director at the British Red Cross, said the promise on vaccines was \"heartening\" but added: \"While every commitment must be welcomed, more needs to be done, and fast.\"\nAnd Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was \"not happening anywhere near fast enough\", calling on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, spent four hours today being questioned by MPs over his handling of the pandemic. During his testimony, he said that the Delta variant, first discovered in India, now makes up 91% of new coronavirus cases in the UK. He also responded to claims by the former aide to the prime minister, Dominic Cummings, that delays to lockdowns and mistakes by Mr Hancock and others had needlessly cost \"tens of thousands\" of lives. Mr Hancock said locking down earlier than 23 March 2020 would have gone against the scientific advice at the time. He also rejected Cummings's claims that he had lied about care home testing. \nAnother 7,393 coronavirus cases have been reported in UK, according to the latest figures. It's the second day running cases have topped 7,000 - prior to this that number was last surpassed in late February. Seven more deaths were reported of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. In the last seven days, there have been 44,008 new positive coronavirus tests in the UK. That's a rise of 17,036 - or 63.2% - from the previous week. The data is \"not heading in the right direction\" and suggests there will be a further rise in the coming weeks, warned chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries.\nThe number of people waiting for hospital treatment in England has topped five million for the first time, NHS England data shows. There were 5.12 million people on the waiting list at the end of April. And more than 385,000 patients have been waiting for a year - down by 50,000 on the previous month. But before the pandemic only 1,600 people faced year-long waits. Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard, who led the research, said: \"Without urgent action targeting areas with the highest unmet need, we risk a generation of patients living in poorer health.\"\nThe US has overtaken the UK as worst hit by the first year of the pandemic in the G7 group of richest countries, analysis shows. The study, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. The analysis shows that between March 2020 and February 2021, there were a fifth more deaths than in a normal year for the US (+20.2%) and a little bit under a fifth for the UK (+19.6%). Charles Tallack from the Health Foundation said the countries faring best through the pandemic were Japan followed by Germany. \nFour weeks ago, Bolton became the focus of national attention as the Delta variant began to threaten the UK's unlocking schedule. In May, 155,016 Covid tests were carried out in the town - one test for every two people. The vaccine bus and other pop-up sites like it have jabbed an extra 22,000 people since 7 May, alongside 80,000 doses given at doctors' surgeries and pharmacies. But officials believe the publicity might have helped achieve something harder to measure - a subtle shift in behaviour as people became more aware of the risk of the new variant.

But what does anyone else do?\n\"In the autumn things will calm down again and these landlords will be going cap-in-hand to people who live in the area, wanting them to rent their places over the winter again, and the test will be, how many people will turn around and say 'No'?\"\nWith lockdown easing the hospitality sector is opening up, but there is a huge shortage of staff.\nUK Hospitality, the trade body that represents the industry, has estimated that there is a shortage of about 188,000 workers.\nHospitality jobs are traditionally some of the lowest paid roles, and the increasing cost of finding a place to live in areas like Cornwall and the Lake District is making it harder for hotels, restaurants and bars to recruit staff. \nEmma Stratton owns Red Hotels. She currently has at least 20 vacancies being advertised, and she says she's struggling to find workers.\n\"We've had people who've accepted employment offers with us and then haven't been able to find accommodation and have had to turn the job down,\" she said.\n\"We're lucky in that we have quite a lot of team accommodation so we're able to offer rooms to key people, but many businesses just don't have that. \n\"The wider problem is, it's not making living in places like Cornwall very easy for local people, and that seems to be causing growing resentment in communities.\"\nHer business pays staff the real living wage of \u00a39.50 an hour and says she believes the industry needs to commit to the long term affordability of roles.\nNikola Kubeckova is a payroll administrator at the Red Hotel group. She and her partner rented a cottage in the Newquay area in 2014 when she moved from the Czech Republic, but in April her landlord asked for the property back.\n\"It was very difficult to find somewhere to rent. We didn't really get a chance to see many properties, because there were just way too many applicants. Every time something new came up we tried to see it but it was pretty much impossible,\" she says.\nKate Nicholls, the Chief Executive of UK Hospitality, says the shortage of affordable accommodation is affecting staff in tourism hotspots across the UK.\nShe says businesses are having to pay more to attract staff and that will have an impact in the price consumers pay.\nShe says: \"We are starting to see wage rate inflation coming through in certain parts of the country and in certain roles, where the local labour market does need to have high wages to attract the staff to those roles, and that's feeding through into customer prices.\""
