      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Imagine if, at the first coronavirus briefing in Downing Street last year, Boris Johnson had said that he would put limits on our lives and the economy for 15 months. \nImagine that he had, a week later, instead of saying that the tide could be turned in 12 weeks, said we should prepare for kids to be out of school, that most shops would be closed on and off for months, that families who don't live near each other might not be able to see each other either, that some of the most vulnerable would have to shield at home, from the disease, for all of that time. \nYou would hardly have believed it. He would hardly have believed it either.\nThe prime minister's trademark used to be optimism - accused often of bluffing over detail to hope for the political best. \nYet as Mr Johnson tries to steer the country towards the exit in the second year of this pandemic, that habit is not much in evidence. \nHe has accepted, at the insistence of the chief medical officer, there will be long gaps between the steps out of lockdown. \nAlso, despite the remarkable progress, and excited rhetoric around the vaccine, there was an important acknowledgement from Mr Johnson too, that it will never reach everyone. \nThe \"significant minority\" who will never take the vaccine will still therefore pose a risk. \nAnd while he has repeatedly promised the steps out of lockdown will be \"irreversible\", inside government of course there is an awareness that is just not the case. \nEveryone fervently hopes this is the last time but an aggressive and unforeseen variant of the disease could interrupt that plan.  \nSome massive upset with the vaccine rollout could knock things off course. \nEven the limited easing up will lead to an increase in cases, and if that is more dramatic than hoped, the brakes could of course go back on. \nDramatic changes in the public's behaviour could also make a difference in the wrong way. \nAnd the government also retains the right to bring back aggressive local lockdowns if infections surge in particular areas. \nBut Mr Johnson's strongest motivation for the go-slow is the determination that this national lockdown can, should, and will be the last. \nWith a belief too that much of the public will be perhaps not content, but willing, to wait that bit longer for a drink with friends if it means children can go back to school and stay there. \nHis calculation is that people, after all this time, will prefer certainty over haste. \nThat's why the prime minister won't be persuaded to go faster by some of his own restless backbenches. \nThat's why other parts of government, even those eager to pull back restrictions, worried about the costs of all this, concede to hurry would be wrong this time. \nAnd that's why Mr Johnson, right now at least, is playing the role of a leader for whom caution is number one. \nA mantle this long pandemic has lent him - a political persona that also, would have been almost impossible to imagine last year. \nP.s. A huge amount of information did emerge today about the road ahead for England, but there were also really big gaps. \nThere was no firm advice on when the millions of people who have been working at home will be expected to go back into the office. \nNo solid expectations of when foreign travel will come back, when the social distancing rules could be relaxed, or whether the government might really introduce some kind of vaccine certification after all (despite previous suggestions that they would not). \nAlongside the plans are several reviews that will shape much of what happens in the next few months. \nThe government, as well as Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff, still has many big decisions to take.

      "text": "Schools in Wrexham will delay opening classes to children aged three to seven due to concerns over coronavirus rates.\nFoundation phase pupils are due to start a phased return to school from the Monday after half term. \nWrexham still has the highest rate of Covid infections in Wales, and will not be sending children back until Friday, 26 February.\nAnglesey, Denbighshire and Gwynedd are also delaying the immediate return of younger pupils.\nThe Welsh Government announced last week that primary schools would begin the process of reopening for the first time since Christmas on 22 February.\nWrexham council said: \"Although coronavirus levels are falling in Wrexham, the figures are still very high, so the council and headteachers are carefully considering plans, while continually monitoring the local situation.\n\"In light of this cautious approach, children will not be returning to schools in Wrexham until Friday, 26 February at the very earliest - depending on local coronavirus levels after half-term.\"\nWrexham and Flintshire still have six of the 10 highest localised rates in Wales, when they are broken down by community - or what are known as middle layer super output areas (MSOAs).\nAlthough these case rates too have dropped back in recent weeks.\nThe highest in Wrexham - Wrexham West - has seen 35 actual positive tests over the last week.\nThere are local hotspots too in Holywell and Bagillt and part of Connah's Quay in Flintshire\nFlintshire council, which currently has the second highest case rate in Wales, said it would review a decision to reopen schools on 22 February \"should the public health situation become a cause for concern\".\nSchools on Anglesey, which has the third highest rate of coronavirus infections in Wales, said it would also be delaying pupils returning, phased from Thursday, 25 February.\n\"Our aim is that all foundation phase pupils are back in their classrooms by Wednesday, 3 March at the latest,\" Anglesey officials said.\nMeanwhile Denbighshire said its primary schools would reopen to foundation phase pupils from Wednesday, 24 February, as long as \"all necessary safety measures\" are in place. \nIn Gwynedd, the council has confirmed the Monday and Tuesday of that week will see schools remain closed for staff to prepare for pupils' return.\n\"Gwynedd's Education Authority has met with head teachers this week to ensure they are fully aware of the latest development and our officers continue to offer help and advice regarding the planned phased opening for foundation phase pupils during the week beginning 22 February,\" a spokesman said.\nFree school meals and school transport will be available for all eligible pupils when those schools reopen, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nChildren classed as vulnerable and those of critical workers have been able to remain in school during lockdown. No timetable has yet been given for the return of other children.\nIn an open letter to headteachers, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the Welsh Government had \"always said\" schools should be \"last to close and first to open\" when safe to do so.\nShe said \"much lower\" rates of transmission of Covid-19 and advice from its Technical Advisory Group had allowed the \"partial and phased return to face-to-face learning in schools\".\nMs Williams explained\u00a0there would be some flexibility to the arrangement over the first week, but with all foundation pupils in school by the end of the week.\nAny further phased return for other year groups will be considered as part of the next 21 day review on 19 February.\nThe Welsh Government has also issued detailed guidance on the return to classes, with teachers told they will be expected to face masks in some circumstances."

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: How will the phased return to school work?",
      "tags": "Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's schools will open up to more pupils later this month, as part of plans for a phased reopening. \nAll pupils in P1-P3 and pre-school children can return to the classroom full-time from 22 February. \nThere will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time.\nHere are the answers to some of the questions you may have about how the return to the classroom will work. \nOne reason for this is the concern that younger children potentially lose out the most from so-called remote learning. The government still feels that a full return of primary pupils is not possible, and the younger classes are being prioritised. Of course some older children are still in primary school buildings because their parents are key workers or because they are deemed vulnerable.\nOlder pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed - but the definition of practical work isn't prescriptive. \nIt is designed to cover the kind of work which cannot be done from home - notably in practical and vocational subjects. It might include work in practical subjects such as art or woodwork. It might also include laboratory work in science subjects. However, the work does not need to be related to the assessments teachers will be carrying out to estimate grades for those who should have sat exams.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hopes to set out the second phase of school re-opening on 2 March. However, she said it was unlikely that there will be any further return to school before 15 March.\nThe key thing will be whether community transmission is under control or not. It is worth watching the daily case numbers to see if they continue to fall.\nThe likelihood is that any decisions on the return will be taken on a Scotland-wide basis.\nTeachers have until the middle of June to submit estimated grades. They need to be signed off by headteachers. The presumption is that candidates will get these grades in August unless the SQA has any cause to question them. There will be no algorithm so a school's previous record should not lead to a candidate's grades being revised up or down. \nDetailed guidance on just what sort of evidence teachers need to gather to justify their estimates has been published by the SQA. The evidence will be needed should grades be queried. Often this could involve what are, in effect, class tests using the kind of questions normally set in exams.\nThe government says the National Qualifications 2021 Group will publish further details soon on how qualifications will be awarded in a way which fairly reflects pupils' experience of remote learning.\nThis could depend on just when secondary pupils may be back in full-time. However, it is worth noting that after Easter, students are often on study leave or consolidating their courses. With no exams - and the June deadline for estimates - this time may be used to actually finish off the courses.\nIt certainly won't have a direct impact or set a precedent. The decision will be taken by the Scottish government and it will be driven purely by the data for Scotland.\nHowever, as a general rule, case numbers in Scotland are lower than in England. How might parents might react if older primary children and early secondary students returned earlier in England than Scotland, even if case numbers south of the border are higher?\nOne challenge for politicians is to try to weigh up whether there is public support for ongoing restrictions and whether the public believes their benefit balances out the harm they cause to so many areas of life. \nSo far, improving case numbers north and south of the border are largely down to lockdown restrictions. Once the impact of the vaccination programme is clearer - especially if, as expected, it substantially cuts deaths and hospital admissions - it will be interesting to see if public attitudes change.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Cwmbran,Cardiff,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Secondary school pupils could all be back in school after the Easter break, the Welsh Government says.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said it was \"her preference\" older pupils return after the holidays, which end on 12 April.\nThe news comes as three-to-seven year olds return to classrooms in Wales in a phased return to face-to-face teaching.\nOther primary pupils, and years 11 and 13, are due to return on 15 March if Covid case rates continue to fall.\nHowever, on Anglesey, the return has been delayed until 1 March, with the infection rate on the island the highest in Wales - 112.8 cases per 100,000 people, compared to a national average of 80 per 100,000. \nIn England, all schools are expected to reopen from 8 March, but a more phased approach is planned in Wales.\nMs Williams told a press conference her plans for schools were \"consistent with UK-wide advice\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives said many parents would be \"frustrated\" and questioned why some other sectors, such as non-essential retail, were earmarked for opening before all pupils go back.\nPlaid Cymru backed the phased return, but the NAHT union said suggestions of an Easter return were \"premature\". \nMs Williams had said on Sunday she hoped more pupils would return if cases continued falling.\nMeanwhile, pupils in years 11 and 13, and those in further education settings, will be tested twice a week, alongside education staff.\nThe Covid case rate in Wales is currently 80 per 100,000 people - the lowest of the UK nations - and Wales' R number is between 0.7 and 0.9, Public Health Wales estimates.\nUnder current proposals non-essential Welsh retailers may begin reopening from 15 March, which is before the bulk of secondary school pupils return.\nAsked about this, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government would \"balance needs\" for the entire population when lifting restrictions. \nThe government would \"use what available headroom we have to prioritise children and young people - that will not change\", she said.\nBut, there \"may be other headroom that allows us to do other things\".\nA decision on when older pupils can return will be taken before the Easter holidays.\nStudents in years with exams may return from 15 March, but Ms Williams said it would not \"necessarily be a return to full time on-site learning\".\n\"That potentially is looking at rotas, cutting class sizes, different types of timetabling so that children can get the face to face contact that they need, but looks to minimise the impact of opening up on the overall public health situation,\" the minister added.\nLisa Freeman's four-year-old son Ethan was returning to his reception class at Ysgol Hamadryad in Cardiff.\nShe said he was \"very nervous\" and he did not really talk about going back to school, so they had \"broached the subject slowly\".\n\"He's struggled with the online lessons,\" Ms Freeman said.\n\"I think, as a four-year-old, being sat behind a computer screen has been very difficult for him. He just didn't engage as much as we would have like him to.\"\nMs Freeman said she was concerned there would be further school closures as it had \"very much affected him\".\n\"Hopefully this is the last time - I think it would be really harmful to pull him out of school again,\" she said.\n\"He hasn't left my side since the beginning of December really. I think it's quite frightening, we try to keep the news off as much as possible [around him].\n\"Just to be around his peers I think is huge for his age group.\"\nVictoria Rosser, from Cwmbran, whose five-year-old son will return on Thursday, said she was not sure if it was the right time for children to return.\n\"I'm a little anxious as I'm a shielding parent who hasn't received the second vaccine, however, I feel more confident than I did in September,\" she said.\nMs Rosser, a former teacher, said her son was excited but also \"a little nervous\" to return to school.\n\"Even though he's in Year 1, he's only spent just over half a year in school,\" she said.\n\"Children of similar age, who haven't had the opportunity to learn at home, could have had changes made to their neuro pathways forever. \n\"So even though I'm scared to send my son back to school, I will, because we are yet to learn the damage it has done to them.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said many parents will be \"frustrated\" after hearing that some students will not return to school until after Easter.\nThe party's education spokeswoman Suzy Davie added the Welsh Government \"can't really claim to have school students as its priority when it eases other restrictions before the return of all pupils to the classroom\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price repeated his call for teachers to be vaccinated.\nBut he added: \"I think the Welsh approach, which is also the Scottish and the Northern Irish one, is the right one and that's taking it in a step by step cautious way rather than doing it all at once\".\nBut Laura Doel, director of headteachers union NAHT Cymru, said ministers should guard against moving too quickly.\n\"Given that many schools are only reopening their doors to foundation phase this week, we need to be careful about giving parents and learners false hope,\" she said. \n\"Statements about a full return after Easter are premature and unhelpful at this stage.\"\nThe Welsh Government said under the current circumstances punitive measures, including fines, would not be appropriate.\nIt said some authorities might deem it necessary to pursue \"a small number of cases relating to persistent absence\" which were unrelated to the pandemic and where there were concerns about the welfare of the child. \nTeaching staff will now be tested twice weekly for Covid, and \u00a35m will be spent on face coverings and other equipment.\nTy Golding - head teacher at Ysgol y Ddraig in Llantwit Major and Holton Primary School in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan - said his staff were \"excited\" at returning to school and \"addressing those wellbeing and learning needs\".\nBut he acknowledged some parents and staff still needed reassuring.\n\"The biggest challenge for us - which hopefully will be incident-free and quiet and all about settling back in - is winning hearts and minds in the community with parents and staff, making sure everyone feels safe and secure,\" he told BBC Radio Wales..\nAsked whether he felt teachers and school staff should be prioritised for a Covid-19 vaccine, Mr Golding said he did, adding it was important they felt \"a sense of prioritisation\".\nMinisters said children aged three to seven had been prioritised to return to school first, due to evidence showing Covid spread less quickly among the youngest children, who can also be more difficult to teach remotely.\nThe Welsh Government had said it expected to see pupils returning from Monday but it would be \"done in a phased and progressive way\".\nPrimary schools in some parts of north Wales have said they would not have children back until later in the week, after concerns over higher case rates.\nWrexham, Anglesey, Denbighshire, Gwynedd and Flintshire are delaying the immediate return of younger pupils - with pupils back in class by Friday.\nCeredigion, the county in Wales with the lowest case rate, is also operating a phased return where children will attend for one day in the first week with a full return expected from 3 March.\nMs Williams said at the weekend the next Welsh Government review would look at whether older exam year pupils could return, alongside the remaining primary school year groups. That includes Years 11 and 13, and college students.\nIn the same interview Ms Williams said: \"Our priority will be to use whatever headroom we have to maximise face-to-face learning for Years 11 and 13, and many head teachers that we're consulting with would like some flexibility to get some Year 10 and Year 12 students in as well.\n\"But we might have to do that on a routine basis, allowing us to cut the number of children in the class down, helping to keep those schools as Covid-secure as possible.\"\nMs Williams also said some university students were due to return to campus this week for practical assessments.\nShe said the Welsh Government was working with universities \"to bring back students when it's safe and appropriate to do\"."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "DJ Jo Whiley says it has been \"the worst week of our lives\" as her sister, who has a learning disability and diabetes, is in hospital with Covid.\nThe BBC Radio 2 presenter said Frances, 53, had been offered a vaccine on Saturday but it was \"too late\" and she was now \"fighting for her life\". \nAnd she urged ministers to \"forget the classifications\" and protect all those with learning disabilities. \nThe government said it was working hard to vaccinate those most at risk.\nWhiley said her sister had become very ill since testing positive for coronavirus following an outbreak at her care home in Northamptonshire.\n\"Twenty-four hours ago we were talking palliative care and yesterday she rallied round and we are seeing her oxygen levels rise, so at the moment we have got hope.\n\"Twenty-four hours ago we didn't have any hope at all, so she is an amazing fighter, she always has been a great fighter and I'm just hoping that her spirit gets her through.\"\nBut she said it was particularly difficult to treat people with learning disabilities because they had complex needs and often struggled to communicate.\nShe said Frances had been so frightened that she would not allow medical staff to give her oxygen, adding: \"That is why her oxygen levels plummeted, that is why she ended up fighting for her life.\"\nWhiley said her parents had not slept \"for days\" but fortunately had been allowed to be with Frances in hospital.\nShe said: \"The idea of Frances having to do this on her own is unthinkable, and also actually people couldn't cope with Frances.\"\nHer sister was so terrified when she was admitted that \"she actually rampaged through the hospital and people couldn't contain her and security guards had to be involved, they had to restrain her\", Whiley explained.\nShe added: \"The fact that my mum was there and was able to talk her down and to be there with her and to try and give her oxygen was crucial.\"\nWhiley has previously questioned why she was offered the vaccine before her sister, who has the rare genetic syndrome Cri du Chat, but said it was possibly because she was deemed a carer for her sister.\nPeople with diabetes and those with a \"severe or profound\" learning disability are in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine, along with unpaid carers for those with disabilities and the elderly.\nSpeaking to Andrew Marr, Whiley said: \"It felt like the cruellest twist in the world because I've been asking for her, wanting for her to have her vaccine for a year... to be protected.\n\"Then, for me to suddenly get a call to say that I've got the vaccine, it just felt hideously unfair. \n\"And she was actually called in for her vaccine last night, my mum got a message to say that she could get vaccinated, but it's too late, she's fighting for her life in hospital. It couldn't be crueller.\"\nWhiley said she hoped speaking about her sister would underline the need to get people with learning disabilities vaccinated \"as quickly as possible\".\nShe said: \"Forget the classifications, forget the cohorts, just protect these people. They are so precious, they're so vulnerable and they have no way of fighting for themselves - we have to fight for them. Get them and their carers vaccinated, stop them dying.\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock, also speaking to Andrew Marr, said: \"My heart goes out to Jo and to her sister and her whole family.\"\nAsked if he found it odd that Whiley was offered the vaccine before her sister, he said it was \"very important that we follow clinical advice in terms of the order of prioritisation\". \n\"And in group six, as it's called, that's where we vaccinate both those with learning disabilities and also their carers. And that group is being vaccinated right now.\"\nEdel Harris, CEO of learning disability charity Mencap, said the story of Whiley's sister had highlighted that people with learning disabilities \"suffered huge health inequalities\" in England and should be prioritised for vaccination.\nMs Harris told the BBC: \"The virus is not deciding if you are profound or severe, or mild or moderate - GPs don't even use those definitions. That's why we think they're arbitrary, they don't mean anything.\" \nNearly six out of every 10 people who died with coronavirus in England last year were disabled, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.\nThe Department of Health said in a statement: \"We understand this is an enormously challenging period for many people and the NHS is working hard to vaccinate those most at risk, as quickly as possible.\"\nIt said the government was following the recommendations of independent experts at the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on which groups to prioritise for Covid-19 vaccines.\nIt added: \"The committee advised the immediate priority should be to prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the biggest factor determining mortality.\""

      "text": "\"Climate change is a threat to our security,\" Boris Johnson told world leaders as he chaired a United Nations Security Council session.\nIt is the first time a British PM has chaired such a meeting since 1992.\nOther speakers included broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and Sudanese climate activist Nisreen Elsaim.\nThe UK holds the presidency of the Security Council this month and hosts the COP26 climate summit in November.\nThe summit in Glasgow will be attended by dozens of world leaders and is likely to be the most significant round of talks since the global Paris Agreement to tackle climate change was secured in 2015.\nAt the council meeting, Mr Johnson said some would argue \"all this green stuff from a bunch of tree-hugging tofu-munchers\" is not a suitable subject for a UN meeting.\n\"I couldn't disagree more profoundly,\" he said adding that the council need to act to protect \"peace, security and stability\" around the world.\n\"Whether you like it or not it is a matter of when, not if, your country and your people will have to deal with the security impact of climate change,\" he said.\nHe also highlighted measures the UK was taking to reduce emissions and stressed the importance of helping vulnerable countries \"adapt and build resilience\".\nA Greenpeace spokesperson accused the PM of \"weapons-grade hypocrisy\" for demanding action while \"planning new coal mines at home and stripping funds for carbon-cutting energy efficiency measures\". \n\"Until the government starts taking the prime minister's advice, his climate leadership will lack any credibility,\" they said.\nThis is the latest in a series of prime ministerial rallying calls on climate change. \nThe year is providing a remarkable stage for Boris Johnson's ambition on the topic - from the Security Council to the chairmanship of G7 in June, culminating in the vital Glasgow climate summit in November.\nBut as he bestrides the global stage, the PM is under fire for his performance at home.\nHis crucial project to cut emissions from home heating - the Green Homes Grant - is in disarray, with the chancellor pulling out funds.\nHis government is building the high-speed rail HS2, which is likely to be adding to carbon emissions until the back half of the century. And he's promoting a \u00a327bn road-building programme.\nWhat's more, the PM is risking his international reputation by permitting a new coal mine in Cumbria while urging other nations to relinquish coal. \nEnvironmentalists say it's time for him to match words with deeds.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\nSpeaking at the start of the meeting, Sir David said climate change posed \"threats to security of a new and unprecedented kind\".\nHe said changes in patterns of weather would \"turn forests into deserts and drown great cities\".\nAnd he warned that the world is \"perilously close to tipping points that once past will send global temperatures spiralling catastrophically higher\".\n\"If we continue on this path we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security - food production, access to water, ambient temperatures and ocean food chains,\" he said.\nHowever he also said the COP26 conference, new technologies and public support for change offered \"grounds for hope\".\nMs Elsaim - who chairs the UN's Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change - told the meeting that her country of Sudan was top of the list \"when it comes to climate instability\". \nShe said drought and food insecurity would lead to large-scale migration making \"conflict inevitable\".\nThe UN Security Council is made up of five permanent members  - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - and 10 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Australia",
      "text": "Australia's deputy prime minister has condemned the \"disgusting\" behaviour of some Australian Open tennis final fans who loudly booed mention of the country's Covid-19 vaccine rollout.\nThe booing happened during an awards ceremony after the men's final, when a tennis official referred to global vaccine efforts as a sign of optimism.\nAustralia started its national inoculation programme on Monday.\nSome cities saw anti-vaccination protests held at the weekend.\nThe men's number one player Novak Djokovic won the final against Russian Daniil Medvedev on Sunday. \nDjokovic has been criticised in the past for appearing to have a casual attitude towards virus-related restrictions and faced scrutiny last year over comments he made about vaccinations. \nThe demonstration was criticised by Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack on Monday.\n\"I don't like booing at any event, and certainly any sporting event,\" he told reporters in Canberra.\n\"This vaccine is going to get our country back to some sort of pre-Covid normality.\"\nAustralia kicked off the first stage of its vaccine programme on Monday. Frontline, health and quarantine workers are in line to get the first of 60,000 Pfizer vaccine doses this week.\nWhile the vaccine has broad support locally, it has also sparked protests. On Saturday, small crowds of anti-vaccination demonstrators marched in cities, including Melbourne and Sydney, to protest against its rollout.\nIn Melbourne, where the Australian Open was held, the crowd also booed mention of the Victorian state government when Tennis Australia chief Jayne Hrdlicka thanked authorities.\nLast week, the government ordered Victoria residents into a snap five-day lockdown amid fears of an outbreak. The tennis event was allowed to proceed and the virus did not spread.\nThe vaccine is not mandatory in Australia but is highly encouraged by health authorities. Australia aims to inoculate four million people - about a sixth of the population - by early March.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison was among the first to get his jab on Sunday, broadcasting the event in an effort to boost national confidence.\nGovernment polling has shown that close to two-thirds of Australians say they will \"definitely\" get vaccinated, while just over one quarter are \"unsure\".\nAustralia has received doses of the Pfizer vaccine and last week approved the AstraZeneca jab.\nBoth have undergone extensive safety checks and are already being used in several countries.\nCritics have suggested the relative delay of the vaccine's roll-out in Australia - compared to other Western nations - could explain a recent small uptick in people \"unsure\" about receiving it.\nThe government has defended the slow roll-out, saying it wanted all elements fully approved by regulators, and that the low infection rate meant it didn't warrant urgent distribution.\nAs of Monday, Australia had under 40 active cases, with most in its hotel quarantine programme. The nation has recorded about 29,000 cases and 909 deaths in the pandemic - far fewer than many nations."

      "text": "A terror suspect who caused nine hours tailbacks at British ports after absconding has been jailed for breaking counter terrorism rules.\nThe man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is a senior member of the banned group al-Muhajiroun.\nHe triggered a manhunt in September after cutting off an electronic monitoring tag and fleeing his home.\nJudge Anthony Leonard QC said the actions had caused \"significant disruption for legitimate travellers\".\nAppearing at the Old Bailey by video link from prison, the man was jailed for three years and two months after previously admitting six breaches of his Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) order.\nTPIM notices allow the authorities to monitor and control people considered to be terrorists - but who are not facing criminal charges.\nSubjects face measures including being made to wear an electronic tag, curfews, relocation, bans on internet use, and limits on who they can meet and where they can go.\nA TPIM can currently be imposed on a person for a maximum of two years.\nMinisters are seeking to lower the standard of proof needed to impose a TPIM.\nThree people were the subject of TPIMs in the last official figures.\nProsecutor Kate Wilkinson said that, on 15 September last year, the man - known only as LF for legal reasons - cut off his tag, burned documents, ordered a taxi to London, and left his home at 01:00 BST.\nHe was arrested in central London around 36 hours later having arranged to hand himself in.\nMs Wilkinson said the manhunt for LF resulted in Operation Stack being introduced - a traffic management procedure that involves lorries departing from Dover being parked on motorways - and checks at UK ports generated \"nine hours tailbacks\" for travellers.\nShe said the operation took place to ensure \"that he could be found and not leave the jurisdiction\".\nThe court heard that prosecutors accepted that LF's actions in absconding did not have a terrorist motive.\nCatherine Oborne, defending, said her client had no plan during his \"short-lived\" flight.\nThe barrister said he had spent the night in the \"open air\" in London, and that he has experienced \"better mental health\" since being remanded in custody because he is less socially isolated or worried about breaching his TPIM measures.\nEarlier this month LF was one of two men who lost an appeal against the measures placed on them. \nThe pair were the first people to be made the subject of a TPIM for the second time.\nLF is a leading radicaliser in al-Muhajiroun, an outlawed organisation that has been linked to multiple attacks and plots, including Westminster Bridge, Fishmongers' Hall, and the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.\nHe was an associate of Khurum Butt, the ringleader of the London Bridge attackers who murdered eight people in June 2017.\nIn 2019 LF was convicted of breaching his first TPIM, but was handed a suspended sentence by a judge at Kingston Crown Court.\nA breach of this suspended sentence added 10 months prison time to the one imposed today.\nFollowing the 2019 court case, he continued to engage with other al-Muhajiroun members. He was subsequently placed under the new TPIM in November that year after he was found to be involved in fresh \"terrorist related activity\", including encouraging terrorism by saying that attacks are permissible."

      "text": "The maker of Fortnite, Epic Games, will not be able to take Apple to court in the UK as part of a high-profile row, a tribunal has ruled.\nFortnite was pulled from Apple and Google's app stores worldwide after it broke rules - which it claims are unfair - about in-app purchases.\nEpic had wanted to take both US companies to court in the UK, alleging they broke competition law.\nBut the Competition Appeal Tribunal gave it permission to pursue Google.\nThat case will relate to specific claims about how Fortnite was pulled from Android's Google Play store.\nThe focus of the case was whether the \"out of jurisdiction\" US companies could be dealt with by British courts, which requires permission of the Tribunal.\nAll three companies are US-based.\nFortnite makes vast sums of money from in-app purchases, when players buy its virtual currency, V-Bucks.\nBut when a player did that on an iPhone or Android version of the game, Apple or Google took a 30% cut of the payment.\nEpic had long argued such a cut was unfair, and inflated prices for players. So last year, it offered players the chance to buy the virtual currency direct from its own website, circumventing Apple and Google.\nThat was explicitly against both companies' app store rules - so both removed Fortnite from their stores.\nEpic had legal cases already prepared against both tech giants, along with an elaborate media campaign attacking Apple.\nThe judge, Justice Roth, said he was \"far from persuaded\" that the UK was the best place for the Epic-Apple dispute.\nBut Google was different, he found, for complex legal reasons involving the corporate structure, Google's Irish subsidiaries, and how much input the different branches of the two tech firms had in implementing the decisions.\nOn balance, Justice Roth found that the US divisions of Google were \"proper parties to those claims\".\nApple also has a presence in Ireland, but it was not involved in Epic's case.\nThe result leaves Epic in the position of being able to pursue Google in the UK, but not Apple - and Apple has been the main focus of its ire.\nThat is partly because Google's Android system is not as tightly locked down as Apple's, and Fortnite can still be downloaded to Android, with extra steps and bypassing security warnings.\nBut Epic Games highlighted that the tribunal said that if US courts would not rule on relief in the UK, that could be a \"powerful factor\" in revisiting the decision regarding Apple.\nEpic Games said it was \"pleased\" about the decision regarding Google, and that it \"will reconsider pursuing its case against Apple in the UK after the resolution of the US case\"."

That includes doing the right thing and waiting your turn.\"\nThe executive is due to publish a pathway to recovery for coming out of lockdown.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the NI executive had been watching what other parts of the United Kingdom were doing.\nShe said she would be looking at the impact the reopening of schools in  Scotland and Wales had on the reproduction (R) number.\nShe also said she would follow England's plan closely as \"our transmission rates are probably similar to theirs and we will want to take that into account\".\n\"What I must do is make sure that we don't go back into lockdown again and that of course is a balancing act,\" she said.\n\"We have to do it in a way that makes sure that we don't step back again.\""

      "tags": "Aviation accidents and incidents,Boeing,Aviation safety,United Airlines,Air travel",
      "text": "US plane manufacturer Boeing has recommended grounding all of the 777-model aircraft which have the same type of engine that suffered failure and shed debris over Denver on Saturday.\nIt said 128 jets should be suspended until inspections are carried out.\nUnited Airlines and Japan's two main operators have already stopped using 56 planes with the same engine.\nFlight 328, carrying 231 passengers, was forced to make an emergency landing at Denver airport. No-one was injured.\n\"While [an] investigation is ongoing, we recommended suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines,\" the company said in a statement.\nPratt & Whitney said it had dispatched a team to work with investigators. \nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United is the only US airline flying this model of 777, with the others being in Japan and South Korea. \nKorean Air, which has six planes in operation and 10 in storage, said it was awaiting instruction from South Korean regulators regarding any measures for its 777 jets.\nUnited Flight 328, bound for Honolulu, suffered a failure in its right-hand engine. Debris from the jet was found scattered over a nearby residential area after it returned to Denver airport.\nThe agency has ordered extra inspections of Boeing 777 jets fitted with the Pratt & Whitney 4000 engine following the incident. \"We reviewed all available safety data following [Saturday's] incident,\" said FAA administrator Steve Dickson in a statement. \n\"Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.\"\nThe FAA met representatives from the engine firm and Boeing on Sunday evening.\nThe initial finding of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is that most of the damage occurred in the right engine, where two fan blades were fractured and other blades also impacted. The main body of the aeroplane suffered only minor damage. \nThe engine failure is the another blow for Boeing after its 737 Max aircraft was grounded for 18 months following two aviation accidents that left 346 people dead.\nAircraft engine failures are rare. Uncontained failures, where debris can erupt from the engine in any direction are mercifully very rare indeed. But an uncontained failure is also much more dangerous.\nA modern twin-engine airliner is designed to be able to fly safely for hours using a single engine.\nThe shrapnel from an uncontained failure, however, can cause serious damage to the rest of the plane, and if it passes through the cabin, it can be lethal. Experts say the failure in the Denver incident appears to have been uncontained, but the damage to the aircraft itself was thankfully minor.\nAlso worrying is that the incident itself appears to have a number of similarities with another failure that occurred on a United Airlines flight in 2018.\nIf the cause in this case is found to be the same - and remember, it may not be - that would raise questions about why the response to that incident from the manufacturer and regulators was unable to prevent a repeat.\nPassengers on board the Denver flight described a \"large explosion\"  shortly after take-off.\n\"The plane started shaking violently, and we lost altitude and we started going down,\" David Delucia said. He added that he and his wife placed their wallets in their pockets so that \"in case we did go down, we could be ID'd\".\nPolice in the town of Broomfield posted pictures of what appeared to be the front of an engine-casing in the front garden of a home. Other fragments were seen around the town, including on a football field.\nNo-one was injured by the falling debris.\nIn Japan, all 777s with the Pratt & Whitney 4000 model engines are to avoid its airspace until further notice. This includes take-offs, landings and flights over the country. \nThe government there has also ordered JAL and ANA airlines to suspend the use of its 777s with the same model engine.\nLast December a JAL flight was forced to return to Naha Airport due to a malfunction in the left engine - the plane is the same age as the 26-year-old United Airlines plane from Saturday's incident. \nIn 2018, the right engine of a United Airlines plane broke shortly before it landed in Honolulu. Following an investigation, the NTSB said the incident was caused by a full-length fan blade fracture. "

      "text": "Canada's House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly to declare China's treatment of its Uighur minority population a genocide.\nThe motion - which passed 266 to 0 - was supported by all opposition parties and a handful of lawmakers from the governing Liberal Party.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and most members of his cabinet abstained. \nThe motion makes Canada just the second country after the United States to recognise China's actions as genocide.\nLawmakers also voted to pass an amendment asking Canada to call on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics from Beijing \"if the Chinese government continues this genocide\".\nChina responded late on Tuesday, saying it condemned and rejected Canada's motion, according to a Reuters report. It quoted foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin as saying that China had lodged \"stern representations\" with Canada. \nMr Trudeau has so far been hesitant to label China's actions against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang a genocide, calling the term \"extremely loaded\" and saying further examination was needed before a decision could be made. \nJust one member of his cabinet, Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau, appeared in parliament for the vote. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Garneau said he had abstained \"on behalf of the government of Canada\".  \nSpeaking ahead of the vote, opposition leader Erin O'Toole said the move was necessary to send a \"clear and unequivocal signal that we will stand up for human rights and the dignity of human rights, even if it means sacrificing some economic opportunity\".\nIn an open letter to Mr Trudeau earlier this month asking him to \"stand up to China\", Mr O'Toole noted the recent banning of BBC World News from China - a decision that followed a BBC report alleging systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture in China's \"re-education\" camps in Xinjiang. \nMonday's non-binding motion marks the latest escalation in Canada-China relations, which have soured over recent years. \nChina's ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu had earlier told the Canadian Press that the motion was \"interfering in [China's] domestic affairs\".\n\"We firmly oppose that because it runs counter to facts,\" he said. \"There's nothing like genocide happening in Xinjiang at all.\"\nRights groups believe that China has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as \"re-education camps\".\nBBC investigations suggest that Uighurs are being used as forced labour.\nCanada's symbolic motion does not lay out next steps, but says the Canadian government needs to follow the lead of its US neighbours.\nBoth the current and former US Secretaries of State, Anthony Blinken and Mike Pompeo, have declared that China's policies against Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in its western Xinjiang region constitute genocide."

      "text": "All schools in England are to reopen on 8 March as part of the prime minister's \"cautious\" four-part plan to lift the coronavirus lockdown.\nBoris Johnson will share his finalised roadmap with ministers later, before unveiling it to MPs and then leading a news conference at 19:00 GMT.\nUp to six people or two households will be allowed to meet outdoors from 29 March, the vaccines minister said. \nRules will be lifted in stages and four conditions must be met at each stage.\nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the prime minister would set out more details on the plan in a Commons statement, which is expected at around 15:30. \nThe first stage of easing will be split into two parts:\nAlthough schools are set to reopen to all pupils on 8 March, it is thought a few days' flexibility may be built in to allow measures like testing to be put in place. \nAlso on 8 March, new rules will allow each care home resident in England to have one regular visitor, with whom they can hold hands. \nAnd from 29 March it is also understood that people will once again be able to travel out of their areas - although guidance will likely still recommend staying local, and overnight stays will not be permitted.\nThe gap between each stage of restrictions being eased is expected to be five weeks, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\nIt comes as children aged three to seven in Wales return to the classroom, along with some students on practical college courses.\nScotland's youngest pupils are also returning to face-to-face teaching in the first step of the phased reopening of schools there. \nMeanwhile, vaccination has had a significant impact on the risk of serious illness from Covid-19, analysis by Public Health Scotland shows. \nFigures for England are expected later. \nData will be used to inform \"every step\" of lifting restrictions, Mr Johnson said.\n\"We will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe,\" he added.\nThe roadmap will outline four steps for easing restrictions. But before proceeding to each next step, the government will examine the data to assess the impact of previous changes. \nThe four conditions that must be met at each phase of lockdown easing are:\nDowning Street said the four tests are currently being met so the first step of lockdown easing in England will proceed as planned on 8 March.\nThe first stage of easing restrictions will be across the whole of England, Downing Street added, due to the current uniform spread of the virus. \nMPs will be given the chance to vote on the regulations enabling England's roadmap in the coming weeks.\nSir Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said the government needed \"flexibility\" if infections levels dropped more quickly than expected. \n\"You can't have a timeline and say you you're going to be data driven. You can either have one or the other,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \nThe rules of combat are beginning to change.\nNo longer is controlling infection and keeping R below 1 seen as the be-all and end-all.\nThat much is clear from the government's four tests for its roadmap to lift lockdown in England.\nInfection rates are only being seen as a problem if they risk a surge in hospital admissions.\nThe reasons for that change can be found from the early results published on the UK vaccination programme.\nScottish researchers have found a \"spectacular\" reduction in the risk of serious illness four weeks after the first dose of the vaccine is given.\nThe link between infections and serious illness is being broken.\nThat is not to say a surge in infections can or will be tolerated - the number of Covid patients in hospital is still only just below where it was in the first peak and not all vulnerable people have been vaccinated yet.\nBut it does give ministers some room for manoeuvre. That is important. Schools are not seen as a significant driver of infection, but reopening them for all could push infection levels up.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted the prime minister \"to learn the lessons of the last two lockdowns\" when \"he came out too quickly\". \nHe told LBC that with restrictions in place for longer, businesses \"desperately\" needed more support, including the extension of business rates relief and VAT cuts for the hospitality sector. \nAll four UK nations have been in lockdown for weeks, after hospitals were put under unprecedented pressure due to the rapid spread of a variant of the virus, first detected in Kent.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. She added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. \nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of restrictions being eased in time for Easter. A review of current measures will take place on 18 March.\nPre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school.\nChildren of key workers and vulnerable pupils have been able to attend school in all parts of the UK throughout the lockdown. \nOn Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was \"early data\" suggesting a reduction in transmission of the virus in people who have had a vaccine, adding that hospital admissions were falling \"much more sharply\" than they were in the pandemic's first wave.\nBut he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the number of people in hospital - currently around 18,000 - was still \"far too high\".\nSir David Spiegelhalter, professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge, said the data on factors like hospital admissions and deaths were \"extremely positive\" and \"better than people would have predicted\". \nHowever, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government would need to \"keep in reserve\" the option of using local measures to tackle outbreaks because of the big difference in infection rates in different parts of the country. \nThe government has set a new target of offering a coronavirus jab to adults aged 50 and over and those in the top nine priority groups by 15 April, followed by all adults by the end of July.\nSo far, more than 17.5 million people in the UK have received a vaccine dose.\nThe order of priority for the under-50s to receive jabs has yet to be outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, told the BBC on Sunday that he expected an announcement to be made on vaccine priorities at some point this week."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM.\nFrom 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs.\nIt requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be \"cautious but irreversible\" and at every stage decisions would be led by \"data not dates\".\nThere was \"no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world\", he said.\nMr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be \"seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all\".\nHe described the plan as a \"one-way road to freedom\" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible \"but the intention is that it should be\".\nIt comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout suggested it was having a \"spectacular\" impact on stopping serious illness.\nAs part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England:\nSecondary school pupils can access tests and will be required to wear face coverings in classrooms and shared spaces like corridors.\nThere will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe second step from 12 April would see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen:\nBut wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed.\nMr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol.\nHe said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest.\nFunerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests.\nThe third step will come from 17 May - if the data allows - and will see the \"rule of six\" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people:\nUp to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes.\nMr Johnson said this step would also \"consider the potential role of Covid status certification\" - which could refer to so-called \"vaccine passports\" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely.\nBefore the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other \"long-term measures\" designed to reduce transmission, including the \"one metre plus\" rule and the wearing of face coverings.\nThey will also consider whether to lift the \"work from home\" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed.\nThe fourth step from 21 June will potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs.\nThe government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished.\nMusic and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector, with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is \"at the back of the queue to re-open\" once restrictions are lifted.\nMPs will vote on the roadmap in late March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers.\nProf Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the \"right balance\" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day.\nSpeaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was \"very important\" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid \"flying blind\".\nSir Patrick also said \"baseline\" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter.\nThe vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year.\nSo why, many may ask, is there such caution?\nThe answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap.\nAmong the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London.\nIt showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022.\nThere is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus.\nThe gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased.\nIt means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. \nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England.\nThe prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight.\nHe faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions.\nOne participant suggested he was talking \"gibberish\" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey.\nAnother said the PM had been \"rattled\".\nWhat annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted \"before\" certain dates.\nHe was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was \"no backtracking\" on the five-week wait between steps.\nThe prime minister also said that \"a debate had to be had\" on domestic vaccine passport certificates.\nIt came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures."

      "text": "People in England are no longer legally required to wear face masks in almost all public spaces, although they are still recommended in some settings. \nThe change is part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures in England.\nMasks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nFrom Thursday 27 January:\nWhat are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?\nFace mask changes: 'We hope customers aren't discouraged'\nIn Scotland, masks must be worn in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).\nThey must be worn in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, and in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. \nThey are compulsory for all school staff as well as secondary school pupils and are required in indoor public spaces in universities.\nLike England, under-12s are exempt.\nFrom Friday 28 January, adults running organised sessions with under-5s will no longer need to wear face coverings. \nIn Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils must wear face coverings inside school buildings, as must staff if they can't socially distance.\nMasks must also be worn on public transport, in shops and hospitality venues unless you're sitting down to eat or drink.\nMasks aren't required in gyms or other exercise venues.\nHowever, people no longer have to show proof of exemption if they're not wearing a mask.\nUnder-13s don't have to wear masks in public indoor places, and primary school pupils are exempt from the rules on public transport.\nPeople no longer have to wear face masks by law in cafes, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, but face coverings are required on public transport and  most public spaces, including shops.\nSecondary school pupils are being asked to wear masks in class until the end of half term. \nThe guidance in Wales applies to everyone aged 11 or over.\nIn England, Transport for London (TfL) officers and police can currently fine people \u00a3200 for their first offence. This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

      "tags": "United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has addressed the nation as the US passed the figure of 500,000 Covid-related deaths, the highest number of any country.\n\"As a nation, we can't accept such a cruel fate. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,\" he said on Monday.\nThe president and vice-president, and their spouses, then observed a moment of silence outside the White House during a candle-lighting ceremony.\nConfirmed US infections now stand at 28.1 million, also a global record.\n\"Today I ask all Americans to remember. Remember those we lost and remember those we left behind,\" President Biden said, calling for Americans to fight Covid together.\nThe president ordered all flags on federal property to be lowered to half mast for the next five days.\nAt the White House, he opened his speech by noting that the number of American deaths from Covid was higher than the death toll from World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined.\n\"Today we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone - 500,071 dead,\" he said.\n\"We often hear people described as ordinary Americans,\" he went on to say. \"There's no such thing, there's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary. They span generations. Born in America, emigrated to America.\"\n\"So many of them took their final breath alone in America.\"\nHe drew on his own experience with grief - his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 and one of his sons died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\"I know what it's like to not be there when it happens. I know what it's like when you are there holding their hands; there's a look in their eye and they slip away,\" he said.\n\"For me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose.\"\nMr Biden's approach to the pandemic is different to his predecessor, Donald Trump, who cast doubt on the impact of the deadly virus and was viewed as having politicised the wearing of masks and other measures needed to prevent the spread of the virus.\nOn 19 January, one day before Mr Biden took office, he held an event to mark 400,000 Americans dying of the disease.\nMonday's event, marking the latest death toll, comes about one month later.\nElsewhere in Washington, the bells at the National Cathedral tolled 500 times, once for every 1,000 Americans lost during the pandemic.\nAlthough numbers are now going in the right direction, hospital admissions - and deaths - remain high, as the key statistics show:\nDr Ashish Jha, dean of the school of public health at Brown University, told BBC News: \"A year ago I could not have imagined that half a million Americans would lose their lives to this disease.\n\"We have so much capability, so many resources... this was all preventable and should not have happened. And yet here we are.\"\nThe nation's top immunologist, Dr Anthony Fauci, told CNN on Sunday: \"People decades from now are going to be talking about this as a terribly historic milestone in the history of this country, to have these many people to have died from a respiratory-borne infection.\"\nAmericans' average life expectancy has dropped by one full year due to Covid-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week. The change has been most acute among racial minorities, who have been disproportionally affected by the deadly virus.\nBlack men suffered the largest decline, with life expectancy dropping by three years between January and June 2020.\nAnd Hispanic men saw a fall in life expectancy of 2.4 years during that period. \nWhen did you first say 'coronavirus'?\nAbout a year ago, the pandemic hit. We're asking you to search through old text messages and find the first time the term coronavirus (corona or Covid) came up in your conversations.\nWhat do you remember from that exchange?

      "tags": "Texas,United States,Severe weather,Houston",
      "text": "The mayor of Houston has called for the state of Texas to pay the huge electricity bills racked up by residents due to the freezing weather.\nSylvester Turner told CBS News it was not the fault of residents that the system could not cope.\nSome residents reported bills of up to $16,000 (\u00a311,500) for just a few days of usage, as temperatures hit 30-year lows of 0F (-18C) last week. \nAt least 70 people died as the freeze swept several southern US states.\nTexas has since seen a return of its usual milder winter weather, with temperatures as high as 64F. \nHowever, residents are still having to boil water due to fears of contamination caused by low water pressure and ruptures at water mains.\nThe deadly storm, which blanketed Texas in snow last week, knocked out power to millions of people across the region. \nBut some residents who were still able to turn on their lights and keep their fridges running found themselves with bills reaching thousands of dollars.\nDallas resident and US Army veteran Scott Willoughby told the New York Times that he faced a $16,000 bill which had obliterated his savings. \nSusan Hosford, who lives in the city of Denison, told the Associated Press she had been charged $1,346 for the first two weeks of February alone and faced bank charges when the money automatically left her account, despite not having enough funds.\nMany people who have gone public on social media about their high electricity bills are customers of electricity provider Griddy, which only serves Texas. \nTexas is one of the few US states to have an independent energy grid - so when the cold snap hit and power was in short supply, they were unable to receive support from neighbouring states. \nAs a result, the Public Utility Commission of Texas decided at an emergency meeting last Monday to raise the price of energy. \nThis change has not affected people on fixed-rate payment plans for their power. However, people on variable-rate tariffs - which can work out cheaper in the short-term, when weather conditions are consistent - have been hit hard by the increase and are now facing soaring costs. \nGriddy offers one of the most popular wholesale plans in the state. The company warned its customers of rising prices due to the storm and told them to switch to a different electricity provider - however there was not enough time for most people. \nElectricity supplies have largely been restored in Texas, but just over 15,000 customers were still without power by Monday lunchtime, according to Poweroutage.us.   \nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the power system for most of the state, is being accused of not being prepared for the shortages. \nMayor Turner told CBS that when he was in the state legislature, he had filed a bill to ensure there was \"adequate reserve\" to prevent blackouts, but it was not considered by the state's leaders. \nThe mayor of the country's fourth largest city suggested the system was not up to the challenges of storms produced by climate change. \n\"All of this was foreseeable. I wrote about it in 2011. And so for these exorbitant costs, it's not the consumers who should assume those costs.\n\"They are not at fault for what happened this week.\"\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price also told CBS that help with bills should come from Texas and the federal government. \nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has called for action to ensure Texans \"do not get stuck with skyrocketing energy bills\". \n\"We have a responsibility to protect Texans from spikes in their energy bills that are a result of the severe winter weather and power outages,\" he said after meeting lawmakers. \nPresident Joe Biden declared a major disaster in Texas on Saturday, clearing the way for more federal funds to be spent on relief efforts.\nAccording to the US National Weather Service (NWS), this was down to an \"Arctic outbreak\" that originated just above the US-Canada border, bringing a winter snow storm as well as plummeting temperatures.\nCold air outbreaks such as these are normally kept in the Arctic by a series of low-pressure systems, the NWS said. \nHowever, this one moved through Canada and spilled out into the US, reaching many southern areas."

      "tags": "Tourism,Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,TUI Travel,TUI Group,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since the plan for easing lockdown was unveiled.\nDespite questions over the return of international travel, the UK's biggest holiday firm, Tui, said bookings for foreign trips jumped 500% overnight.\nThe owner of UK-based holiday firms Hoseasons and Cottages.com said it sold a record 10,000 breaks.\nThe government said a decision on easing international travel would not happen until mid-May at the earliest.\nBut Tui said its bookings for July-onwards had soared with Greece, Spain and Turkey the most popular destinations.\nAmid uncertainty over when foreign travel will be allowed, some holidaymakers have their sights set on a UK break.\nSimon Altham, group chief commercial officer at Awaze, the company behind Hoseasons, said: \"Last year following similar announcements we saw bookings peak at one every 11 seconds, but this time demand has exceeded our expectations and comfortably broken that record.\"\nNat Sommers told the BBC she had booked a family trip to Yorkshire after Boris had announced his plans to ease lockdown.\n\"We'd been keeping our eye on a few places over the last few weeks in anticipation of lockdown being eased,\" she said.\n\"We just decided to go for it an book it in the hope that things would be back to relative normality come August.\"\nBoris Johnson has said a global travel taskforce would put forward a report by 12 April on how to return to international travel.\nThe government would then make a decision on removing restrictions on international travel, but not before 17 May at the earliest. \nAs the government has said dates could move for the start of international travel, Tui has said that anyone due to travel between 17 May and the end of June can change their booking to a later date without a fee.\nAndrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK and Ireland, described the government's steps as \"positive\".\nThomas Cook said traffic to its website was up over 100% on Monday from 15:00 GMT onwards, with bookings \"flooding in\" for countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.\n\"The government's announcement today is good news for those of us desperate to get away on holiday,\" said Thomas Cook's chief executive Alan French.  \n\"While we await more details, it's clear that the government's ambition is to open up international travel in the coming months and hopefully in time for the summer holidays.\"\nThere was a big leap in family bookings for the summer holidays, especially for August, as well as people booking for the October half term and Christmas, a Thomas Cook spokesman said.\nEasyJet reported a 337% surge in flight bookings and a 630% jump in holiday bookings for locations such as Alicante, Malaga, Palmo, Faro and Crete. \nThe airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said Boris Johnson's announcement had \"provided a much-needed boost in confidence\" for its UK customers.\n\"We have consistently seen that there is pent up demand for travel and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what UK consumers have been waiting for,\" he said. \nTour operator and airline Jet2 also reported a 1,000% increase in bookings in the 24 hours following the prime minister's announcement. Popular destinations include Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, with a notable spike in demand from July onwards.\nIts chief executive, Steve Heapy, said: \"The government's announcement is the news [holidaymakers] have been longing for, and the continued surge in bookings shows how ready our customers are to get away to the sunshine on a real package holiday.\"\nWhile bookings are high, there are still plenty of questions about how international travel will resume - and no guarantees that it will start again in mid-May.\nThe industry has seen restrictions put on top of restrictions over the last few months, with visitors from entire continents banned, the introduction of quarantine hotels and multiple tests required.  \nRemoving them will take some careful unpicking. \nThe government has said that any removal will depend on the location of concerning variants, progress of vaccine rollouts here and abroad as well as death rates and hospital admissions.\nIt's also not just about us. Other countries will need to agree to allow British tourists in. But after fears they could be left off the roadmap, the travel industry is keen to make this plan and these dates work. \nAmanda Matthews, managing director and owner of Ramsbottom-based luxury travel agency network Designer Travel, said her firm had seen double the number of enquiries and new bookings for the summer. \n\"But we've also had hundreds of calls from people who've got bookings for travel in March, April, May and June - still very uncertain about whether they will be travelling or not,\" she told the BBC. \n\"Because there's no concrete date yet for the reopening of international travel, as a travel agent, we can't answer our existing clients' questions about holidays they've already booked for spring and summer. We've got no idea.\"\nWhile the roadmap has provided hope for summer holidays, retail expert Kate Hardcastle said there was also \"huge disappointment\" for the travel industry - particularly among domestic overnight accommodation providers such as mobile home holiday parks and holiday cottage providers.\n\"Easter is obviously a critical part of the travel calendar for travel agencies and the industry, so it's a lost opportunity, one less holiday to be able to sell within,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I also know a lot of families are dependent on Easter holidays as it tends to be cheaper and more cost effective than the summer holidays. It would be awful to think that some people are completely priced out of a holiday this year.\"\nBut data from hotel technology company Avvio suggests a heyday for upmarket UK hotels, with August revenue for 4- and 5-star hotels more than tripling as would-be holiday makers bank on domestic breaks being more likely.\nOn Tuesday, global hotels group InterContinental Hotels, which owns the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands, said the sector was unlikely to see a recovery until later this year, dependent on vaccine rollouts.\n\"2021 has begun with many of these challenges still in place,\" chief executive Keith Barr said, as the company unveiled a $260m (\u00a3185m) loss."

      "text": "Large globs of tar have washed up on much of Israel's Mediterranean coastline in what officials are calling one of the worst environmental disasters to hit the country. \nThousands of volunteers and soldiers are helping to clear the pollutant which is damaging wildlife. \nIsrael is trying to track the source of the pollution, which is thought to have come from a ship spilling oil. \nThe general population has been told to avoid the beaches. \nDozens of tonnes of tar have been found on many stretches of Israel's 190km (120 miles) Mediterranean coastline and there are fears it will take months, or even years to clean up. \nNGOs have reported turtles and birds covered in oil. \nThe pollution is \"one of the most serious ecological disasters\" in Israel's history, according to the Nature and Parks Authority. \nThe source is thought to be an oil spill produced during a storm on 11 February from a ship some 50km (30 miles) off the coast. Satellite imagery and wave patterns are being used to trace the ship responsible. \nEnvironmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel said nine ships were being investigated. \nThe Israeli government is considering legal action to win compensation which could run to millions of dollars. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been inspecting the damage at one of the beaches. \nLast Thursday, a 17m-long (55ft) fin whale was found dead on a beach in southern Israel, and the Nature and Parks Authority said an autopsy had found an oil-based product - a black liquid - in its system. \nHowever, an official said it was too early to say whether the liquid came from the same oil spill.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,John Swinney,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's youngest pupils are returning to the classroom for the first time since the Christmas break.\nIt is stage one in a phased reopening of schools which have been closed to all but a minority of pupils since the beginning of January. \nEducation Secretary John Swinney insisted \"detailed clinical analysis\" assured him it is safe. \nBut concerns have been raised about the measures in place to reduce risk of transmission.\nMr Swinney told BBC's Good Morning Scotland that case prevalence data would be closely monitored to determine the impact of the phase one return.\nBut he said Scotland would not be following England, where all pupils are due to return to school on 8 March.\nAsked if it would be \"dangerous\" to send everyone back on that date, Mr Swinney said: \"I wouldn't have clinical authorisation to do that.\"\nThe deputy first minister added: \"We will move as quickly as we possibly can do but we have to do it within the scientific and clinical advice that is available to us.\"\nMr Swinney also urged parents to act responsibly during the first phase of lockdown easing.\nHe added: \"The biggest threat to the opening of schools is not outbreaks in schools. It is community transmission.\"\nEpidemiologist Dr Deepti Gurdasani told BBC Scotland at the weekend there was some evidence from England that younger children could bring infections back into homes. \nBut Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, said the return of schools was about balancing the \"risks and benefits\".\nShe told BBC Good Morning Scotland: \"There will likely be cases emerging in schools over the next few weeks but the vast majority of schools should be fine, and that we have to keep perspective on.\"\nShe said the majority of scientific evidence was that there is an \"age gradient\" in infections - with very few outbreaks in nurseries but with teenagers and university students much more prone to infection. \nProf Sridhar added: \"I think what we have to do is work back up through that gradient. We are doing that starting with primaries and early years - the approach Denmark has also taken.\" \nOn Sunday the deputy first minister pointed to documents prepared by a government expert advisory group which states that younger children are less likely to catch or pass on the virus than older children and adults. \nAre you a parent or a teacher? How do you feel about children returning to school? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nPlans to reopen schools have been welcomed by opposition parties but the Scottish Conservatives have urged the government to publish plans for helping pupils catch-up with schooling they have missed. \nAs well as the youngest children returning to school, a small number of senior secondary pupils will be allowed into school buildings on a part-time basis to complete work for national qualifications. \nOther age groups will continue to learn from home and it is unlikely they will return to the classroom before 15 March at the earliest. \nIn primary schools measures to minimise the spread of the virus include regular hand-washing, open windows, and 2m physical distancing between adults, and between adults and children. \nStaff will also be offered regular lateral flow tests. \nResources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown.\nProf Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, has written to parents asking them to play their part in the safe return.\nHe urged them to: \nAppealing to parents not to relax the rules elsewhere, he reminded them that indoor play dates are not allowed  - though children can play together outside. \nAnd he said parents should continue to work from home if they are able to do so. \nMr Swinney's safety assurance came after an epidemiology expert raised concerns about the knock-on effects of sending children back to school. \nDr Deepti Gurdasani, of Queen Mary University of London, said data from England showed primary school children were two times more likely to be the first Covid case in a household, and once infected were two times more likely to infect their contacts. \nSpeaking to BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, she said children aged six and above should wear masks in schools and more attention should be paid to ventilation. \nThe EIS teaching union has also raised concerns about school safety and have said a blended learning model - with about half of pupils in classes at any one time - would be more appropriate.

      "text": "The idea that children must \"catch up\" with learning lost due to the pandemic is heaping \"huge\" pressure on them, educational psychologists have warned.\nMany pupils have missed out on months of face-to-face teaching, and the PM has appointed a catch-up tsar to lead educational recovery in England.\nBut the British Psychological Society says children's wellbeing, rather than their learning, should be the focus.\nThe government said it was funding support for pupils' mental wellbeing.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson will set out his \"road map\" for lifting lockdown restrictions in England later, with all schools expected to reopen on 8 March.\nSome younger children will also return to classrooms in Northern Ireland that week, while Wales and Scotland begin a phased return to schools for some pupils from Monday.\nDr Dan O'Hare, co-chair of the BPS division of educational and child psychology, said it was \"absolutely understandable\" that parents are concerned children have \"been missing out on many aspects of their formal education\" - but warned against setting expectations too high.\n\"The notion that children need to catch up or are 'behind' at school due to the pandemic reinforces the idea that children have 'one shot' at their education and puts them under even more pressure to perform academically after what has been a challenging and unprecedented time for everyone,\" he told the PA News agency.\n\"Formal lessons must of course continue, but we shouldn't simply expect children and young people to pick up where they've left off and 'catch up' immediately on any gaps in their learning.\n\"This places huge and unnecessary pressure on children who have been through an extraordinary and potentially stressful time.\"\nMr Johnson has previously said that \"no child will be left behind\" because of the pandemic, and has appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner to oversee how England's schools can catch up from the disruption caused by the pandemic.\nSir Kevan said extra hours of academic learning - plus sport, music and drama - will be needed to help pupils make up ground.\nBut head teachers' leaders have warned against \"misconceived and unhelpful\" suggestions about longer schools days and shorter holidays to help pupils catch-up.\nThe BPS said children should be supported through socialisation and play, and echoed head teachers' calls for a quality-over-quantity approach to learning, saying there should be a phased return to regular schooling.\nDr O'Hare said it was \"unrealistic\" to expect children who have lived through such disruption to settle into formal learning.\n\"Whatever a child or young person's circumstances, we can't assume that the right thing to support their recovery and wellbeing is for them to be in lessons for longer each day,\" he added.\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"We know the pandemic has had an impact on many children and young people's mental health and wellbeing, and that's why we are working to fully reopen schools as soon as possible.\n\"Our guidance has emphasised the importance of pastoral support both in school and as part of remote provision and included advice and support on mental wellbeing.\n\"The \u00a3650m catch-up premium funding can be used for pastoral support activity where needed to support reengagement and recovery.\n\"To support children returning to schools, our \u00a38m Wellbeing for Education Return programme funds local expert support for education staff to respond to emotional and mental health pressures some children and young people may be facing.\" "

      "tags": "Taliban,Ashraf Ghani",
      "text": "Afghanistan's president says there is a \"window of opportunity to accelerate the peace process\" following Nato's announcement that it has made no final decision on withdrawing troops.\nAshraf Ghani made the comments in an exclusive interview with the BBC.\nThe Nato military alliance has close to 10,000 troops in the war-torn country. Under a US-Taliban deal, they were due to be withdrawn by May, after 20 years.\nBut there are concerns that Taliban violence could intensify.\nMr Ghani told the BBC's Lyse Doucet that Nato's announcement provided an opportunity for \"all parties to the conflict to recalculate and reach a conclusion that we've long reached, that use of force is not the solution\".\n\"We must reach a political settlement,\" he said.\nHe added that there needed to be a \"concerted effort\" internationally \"to send signals that certain types of behaviour are unacceptable\".\nThe Afghan president would not be drawn on how many foreign troops were needed, or for how long, saying it \"depends on the intensity of the war\".\nUS President Joe Biden is currently reviewing the deal struck by his predecessor. While most foreign troops now in Afghanistan are not US forces, the Nato operation could find it hard to continue if American support was withdrawn.\nThe current US presence in Afghanistan dates back to 2001 when soldiers invaded to remove the Taliban from power, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But the movement regrouped and by 2018 was active in more than two-thirds of the country, threatening the elected government.\nMr Ghani, who was shut out of the US-Taliban deal, told the BBC he was \"delighted\" with his relationship with the new US administration, and a new \"coherence\" among the international community's approach to Afghanistan's future.\n\"The force of coherence is what I'm counting on to avoid the tragedies. There's so many fears of collapse into civil war,\" he said, acknowledging that both sides were preparing for warfare.\nBut he dismissed fears of a Taliban military victory. \"This is not Vietnam. The government is not collapsing.\"\nHis comments came amid stalled peace talks between the two sides and high levels of violence in the country.\nBut Mr Ghani still said the context was \"one of hope, not one of despair\". \nThe Afghan leader is now facing growing calls for an interim government to bring the Taliban into power and avoid a descent into chaos and a possible civil war. \nHe said his five-year term mattered less than peace, but insisted \"the future will be determined by the people of Afghanistan, not by somebody sitting behind the desk, dreaming\". \nHe said hard decisions and sacrifices lie ahead on all sides in a year where peace would be won or lost. \n\"From our side, we have a sense of urgency, we're willing to make the hard decisions, and there are going to be hard decisions required. Forty years of violence in this country is enough,\" he said.\nThere's a new confidence in the heavily fortified palace. \nAfter years when President Trump's team seemed to send signals that the Taliban were worthier partners than the government, President Ghani feels he's now being listened to. But \"be ready to pay a price\" is also the warning conveyed to Kabul by a Washington which still doesn't want to stay a day longer than necessary. \nThat price could include President Ghani's five-year term and he seems to know that. But he's still insisting on elections - despite their tarnished history here. \nHis allies and enemies have other ideas on how to move more quickly towards a power-sharing arrangement. Some express cautious optimism a deal could be done in months. Others, including President Ghani, may believe gaps are too big to bridge so they're preparing for a hard fight. \nWhatever the change in mood, beyond palace walls Afghans are still losing their lives, day in day out."

      "text": "The first data on the UK Covid vaccine rollout suggests it is having a \"spectacular\" impact on stopping serious illness, researchers say.\nWithin weeks, one shot reduces the risk of being admitted to hospital by at least three-quarters for the over 80s.\nResearchers said this was particularly impressive as this age group was the most frail and least likely to have a strong immune response.\nMonitoring of health staff also shows vaccination helps cut transmission.\nSo far a third of adults have received a vaccination in the UK.\nBut questions had been raised about the policy of leaving a gap of three months between first and second doses.\nThe data from Public Health England (PHE) and Public Health Scotland (PHS) has been published on the day the government in England has set out its roadmap for lifting restrictions.\nThe research was carried out separately in the two nations, but both studies involved tracking those who had been vaccinated and comparing them against people who had not been.\nThe PHS study found that, by the fourth week after the first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines, the risk of being admitted to hospital had been reduced by 81%.\nIt was slightly higher when younger age groups were included.\nLead researcher Prof Aziz Sheikh said the results were \"very, very\" impressive and both vaccines were working \"spectacularly\".\n\"These results are very encouraging and have given us great reasons to be optimistic for the future,\" he added.\nIn England researchers followed up those who were vaccinated to see if they became ill, needed to be admitted to hospital and whether they died.\nThe cut off was two weeks after being given a Pfizer vaccine.\nIt found vaccination reduced the risk of symptomatic infection by 57%; for those infected the risk of being admitted to hospital was reduced by 40% and then if people were admitted to hospital it reduced the risk of dying by 56%.\nOverall this meant, the team said, the risk of being admitted to hospital and dying was reduced by at least 75%.\nThe PHE team was also able to get an idea of what the vaccine was doing in terms of slowing the spread of the virus.\nHealth staff who were vaccinated were routinely tested every two weeks whether or not they had symptoms.\nOne dose reduced the risk of catching the infection by 70% - if an individual is not infected they cannot pass it on.\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations of PHE, said: \"We should be very encouraged by these initial findings.\"\nAnd she added the findings for the over 80s were particularly impressive as they were the frailest people who are perhaps least likely to have a strong immune response. \nTrials of both vaccines had suggested they would have a significant impact at preventing hospitalisations.\nBut for the Pfizer vaccine studies, that had involved a second dose being given after three weeks.\nThe UK has adopted a policy of delaying the second jab of both vaccines by three months, which had led some to question whether the approach would give sufficient immunity.\nThe trials of the AstraZeneca looked at a longer dosing interval so there was more confidence about that vaccine.\nDr Josie Murray, of Public Health Scotland, said the findings were \"brilliant news\" and suggested the vaccine programme was working."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM.\nFrom 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs.\nIt requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be \"cautious but irreversible\" and at every stage decisions would be led by \"data not dates\".\nThere was \"no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world\", he said.\nMr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be \"seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all\".\nHe described the plan as a \"one-way road to freedom\" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible \"but the intention is that it should be\".\nIt comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout suggested it was having a \"spectacular\" impact on stopping serious illness.\nAs part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England:\nSecondary school pupils can access tests and will be required to wear face coverings in classrooms and shared spaces like corridors.\nThere will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe second step from 12 April would see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen:\nBut wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed.\nMr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol.\nHe said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest.\nFunerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests.\nThe third step will come from 17 May - if the data allows - and will see the \"rule of six\" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people:\nUp to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes.\nMr Johnson said this step would also \"consider the potential role of Covid status certification\" - which could refer to so-called \"vaccine passports\" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely.\nBefore the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other \"long-term measures\" designed to reduce transmission, including the \"one metre plus\" rule and the wearing of face coverings.\nThey will also consider whether to lift the \"work from home\" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed.\nThe fourth step from 21 June will potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs.\nThe government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished.\nMusic and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector, with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is \"at the back of the queue to re-open\" once restrictions are lifted.\nMPs will vote on the roadmap in late March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers.\nProf Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the \"right balance\" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day.\nSpeaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was \"very important\" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid \"flying blind\".\nSir Patrick also said \"baseline\" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter.\nThe vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year.\nSo why, many may ask, is there such caution?\nThe answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap.\nAmong the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London.\nIt showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022.\nThere is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus.\nThe gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased.\nIt means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. \nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England.\nThe prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight.\nHe faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions.\nOne participant suggested he was talking \"gibberish\" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey.\nAnother said the PM had been \"rattled\".\nWhat annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted \"before\" certain dates.\nHe was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was \"no backtracking\" on the five-week wait between steps.\nThe prime minister also said that \"a debate had to be had\" on domestic vaccine passport certificates.\nIt came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All schools in England are to reopen on 8 March as part of the prime minister's \"cautious\" four-part plan to lift the coronavirus lockdown.\nBoris Johnson will share his finalised roadmap with ministers later, before unveiling it to MPs and then leading a news conference at 19:00 GMT.\nUp to six people or two households will be allowed to meet outdoors from 29 March, the vaccines minister said. \nRules will be lifted in stages and four conditions must be met at each stage.\nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the prime minister would set out more details on the plan in a Commons statement, which is expected at around 15:30. \nThe first stage of easing will be split into two parts:\nAlthough schools are set to reopen to all pupils on 8 March, it is thought a few days' flexibility may be built in to allow measures like testing to be put in place. \nAlso on 8 March, new rules will allow each care home resident in England to have one regular visitor, with whom they can hold hands. \nAnd from 29 March it is also understood that people will once again be able to travel out of their areas - although guidance will likely still recommend staying local, and overnight stays will not be permitted.\nThe gap between each stage of restrictions being eased is expected to be five weeks, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\nIt comes as children aged three to seven in Wales return to the classroom, along with some students on practical college courses.\nScotland's youngest pupils are also returning to face-to-face teaching in the first step of the phased reopening of schools there. \nMeanwhile, vaccination has had a significant impact on the risk of serious illness from Covid-19, analysis by Public Health Scotland shows. \nFigures for England are expected later. \nData will be used to inform \"every step\" of lifting restrictions, Mr Johnson said.\n\"We will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe,\" he added.\nThe roadmap will outline four steps for easing restrictions. But before proceeding to each next step, the government will examine the data to assess the impact of previous changes. \nThe four conditions that must be met at each phase of lockdown easing are:\nDowning Street said the four tests are currently being met so the first step of lockdown easing in England will proceed as planned on 8 March.\nThe first stage of easing restrictions will be across the whole of England, Downing Street added, due to the current uniform spread of the virus. \nMPs will be given the chance to vote on the regulations enabling England's roadmap in the coming weeks.\nSir Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said the government needed \"flexibility\" if infections levels dropped more quickly than expected. \n\"You can't have a timeline and say you you're going to be data driven. You can either have one or the other,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \nThe rules of combat are beginning to change.\nNo longer is controlling infection and keeping R below 1 seen as the be-all and end-all.\nThat much is clear from the government's four tests for its roadmap to lift lockdown in England.\nInfection rates are only being seen as a problem if they risk a surge in hospital admissions.\nThe reasons for that change can be found from the early results published on the UK vaccination programme.\nScottish researchers have found a \"spectacular\" reduction in the risk of serious illness four weeks after the first dose of the vaccine is given.\nThe link between infections and serious illness is being broken.\nThat is not to say a surge in infections can or will be tolerated - the number of Covid patients in hospital is still only just below where it was in the first peak and not all vulnerable people have been vaccinated yet.\nBut it does give ministers some room for manoeuvre. That is important. Schools are not seen as a significant driver of infection, but reopening them for all could push infection levels up.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted the prime minister \"to learn the lessons of the last two lockdowns\" when \"he came out too quickly\". \nHe told LBC that with restrictions in place for longer, businesses \"desperately\" needed more support, including the extension of business rates relief and VAT cuts for the hospitality sector. \nAll four UK nations have been in lockdown for weeks, after hospitals were put under unprecedented pressure due to the rapid spread of a variant of the virus, first detected in Kent.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. She added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. \nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of restrictions being eased in time for Easter. A review of current measures will take place on 18 March.\nPre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school.\nChildren of key workers and vulnerable pupils have been able to attend school in all parts of the UK throughout the lockdown. \nOn Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was \"early data\" suggesting a reduction in transmission of the virus in people who have had a vaccine, adding that hospital admissions were falling \"much more sharply\" than they were in the pandemic's first wave.\nBut he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the number of people in hospital - currently around 18,000 - was still \"far too high\".\nSir David Spiegelhalter, professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge, said the data on factors like hospital admissions and deaths were \"extremely positive\" and \"better than people would have predicted\". \nHowever, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government would need to \"keep in reserve\" the option of using local measures to tackle outbreaks because of the big difference in infection rates in different parts of the country. \nThe government has set a new target of offering a coronavirus jab to adults aged 50 and over and those in the top nine priority groups by 15 April, followed by all adults by the end of July.\nSo far, more than 17.5 million people in the UK have received a vaccine dose.\nThe order of priority for the under-50s to receive jabs has yet to be outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, told the BBC on Sunday that he expected an announcement to be made on vaccine priorities at some point this week."

      "text": "A number of businesses will be able to reopen from 12 April if conditions are met, the Prime Minister has announced.\nThe news has prompted relief across the business community, although many sectors warn they remain under severe financial pressure.\n\"We are delighted to have some dates to work towards at last,\" skincare maker Gareth McKeever told the BBC.\nHe and wife Claire hand-make Pure Lakes Skin Care products at a workshop in the Lake District.\nThey supply hotels and shops, as well as sell online, but lost four-fifths of their business during lockdown, so have been desperate for some certainty about the future so they can plan.\n\"Although our online sales have been a Godsend during lockdown, 80% of our business is supplying hospitality and non-essential retail, and that disappeared almost overnight,\" said Mr McKeever. \n\"We may still have some time to wait before these customers can reopen but at least we can now start to plan ahead and prepare.\"\nHe added that for a small, family-run business with limited access to third-party finance, \"uncertainty is a huge obstacle\" to buying raw materials and maintaining stock levels, let alone future growth plans. \n\"It is a big relief that we now have something to work towards.\"\nRestaurants and non-essential retailers have given a cautious welcome to the roadmap with its offer of hope of reopenings.\nMark Smith, marketing adviser for the Franzos chicken chain in the south east of England, said the news was a relief.\n\"It is great to hear the announcement today, a clear roadmap with restaurants allowed to allow customers to dine-in again inside in May,\" he told the BBC. \n\"We, as does the wider hospitality industry, welcome this decision and can't wait to welcome customers back.\"\nIan Watson, chief executive of Hotter Shoes in Lancashire, is pleased but cautious: \"It's good to see a route map for the reopening of non-essential retail, however I worry it is still lacking in confirmed dates and reliant on many ifs and buts.\"\nHe said retailers will need to understand the confirmed dates and criteria they are working to, \"not only so that we can prepare the business internally, but in order to care for our staff and our suppliers effectively. \n\"Our retail staff have been in limbo for the majority of the past 12 months, and now need clarity on when they will be returning to work.\"\nOther business sectors have welcomed the possibility of starting up again, but have warned that they will need more help to survive.\nHaving some certainty will help the events industry, said Matthew Shaw, creative director at events company Sauveur.\n\"The events and weddings industries have been crying out for a clear framework from which to build. At long last, this roadmap offers some much-needed visibility and guidance,\" he said. But he warned that it is only the first step. \n\"The second summer season decimated by the pandemic will not be easy,\" said Mr Shaw.\n\"It's vital that the Budget includes extensive support for freelancers and the self-employed, a clear plan for small businesses, and a substantial commitment to the events industry.\"\nSarah Haywood, spokesperson for the UK Weddings Taskforce, warned that 400,000 jobs in the industry remain at risk.\n\"It is disappointing that for the next four months we will only gradually get to 30 guests permitted at a wedding. This is simply unviable for most businesses,\" she warned. \n\"The infrastructure at the heart of our sector is close to collapse and until weddings can proceed normally, 400,000 jobs across 60,000 businesses remain in jeopardy.\"\nThe hospitality sector is also on a knife-edge, said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls.\n\"The sector is devastated that its reopening will be so far away. From the start of November, the sector will have been closed for nearly 200 days, with just a couple of weeks of heavily-restricted trading in December,\" she said. \n\"A major package of financial support is imperative if hospitality is to survive.\"\nThe gym sector too will need support, said Neil Randall, chief executive of Anytime Fitness UK.\n\"Today's announcement is a positive step and we acknowledge that leisure and gym facilities been given next priority after education and outdoor sport,\" said Mr Randall. \n\"However, we urge the chancellor to provide a comprehensive relief package for our sector which was endured over eight months of closure in the past twelve months.\"\nJonathan Geldart, director general of The Institute of Directors said: \"It is crucial that businesses have clarity around how the government perceives the UK is meeting its four key tests to help them plan, taking into considering the lead time's they need to ensure workplaces are Covid-safe and so they can start rehiring.\"\nMike Chery, national chairman, The Federation of Small Businesses said: \"It's important for this plan to protect against a fourth Covid wave and accompanying lockdown, the imposition of which would be devastating for the 250,000 firms that fear closure this year. The Chancellor must deliver on the Prime Minister's 'whatever it takes' pledge at next week's Budget.\"\nIan Wright, chief executive of The Food and Drink Federation said: \"For a great many of the food and drink manufacturers supplying the hospitality and food service sectors, a return to 'business as usual' seems an awful long way off. As such, it is only correct that the Chancellor outlines significant extensions to the furlough and credit insurance schemes as part of his Budget announcement next week.\"\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK said: \"We're grateful to the Prime Minister and Department for Transport for providing the clarity the whole sector was looking for that international travel can reopen this summer, as soon as it is safe to do so.\"\nMike Hawes, chief executive of The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: \"The fact that retail showrooms must remain closed until April at least, is deeply disappointing given these facilities are Covid-secure, large premises with low footfall and able to operate on an appointment-only basis.\""

Then he uttered the words that we never really want to hear on an online lesson: 'My dad is having a seizure.\"\nMr Cannon-Jones lives in Cardiff, a 30-minute drive from where the boy, Rhys, lives.\n\"I felt utterly helpless because I'm so far away, but I had to do something,\" he explained.\n\"First, I asked Rhys to remain calm. At this point I could hear dad in the background was having difficulties breathing.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nMr Cannon-Jones' attention then turned to making sure the other children on the call, watching a \"show and tell\", could not see or hear what was going on.\nHe asked Rhys if he could call any family living nearby, and called the school himself to see if staff were available to go to the boy's home.\n\"As the situation developed, they had managed to get hold of grandpa who had come around and was assisting,\" said Mr Cannon-Jones.\n\"Then about five minutes later or so, the child came back on the video call to say dad was okay, they had managed to get him on the sofa, he was comfortable and was breathing normally.\"\nHe added: \"That was a huge relief.\"\nAsked how he managed to remain calm, Mr Cannon-Jones said: \"Honestly, I don't know. In the moment my teacher brain activated - the calm kicked in and I just did what I felt like I had to do.\"\nTeachers have been using video call technology to deliver lessons since schools closed were shut in December amid a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, with the youngest children returning to classrooms on Monday in a phased reopening of schools.\nThe episode, on February 10, was not the first time Rhys's father, Dean Williamson, has had a seizure, having developed epilepsy following surgery for a brain tumour in 2018.\nMr Williamson said the last thing he remembered was being on his knees looking for a card.\n\"My eldest son said, 'I'm going to ring my mum', but she wasn't answering. Then James tried his nanny. She said she would ring his bampy [grandfather] and luckily he was doing some work at my cousin's house which is near here.\"\nJames said he had done his best to help his father when he collapsed. \n\"I managed to lift him up, then I kept on trying to call my mum,\" he said.\n\"I felt like I was able to do it but I think Rhys felt way too scared to come [too close].\"\nMr Williamson was full of praise for his sons and everyone who helped that day, reserving special mention for the school.\n\"The boys were amazing and the school have been fantastic. They looked after James and Rhys the next day as they went into school.\n\"The headmaster called [my wife] Claire and said they were looking to recognise how Mr Cannon-Jones reacted.\""

      "text": "Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday.\nIt is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions.\nStay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time.\nAs part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March.\nThe first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve.\nSome non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon.\nThe government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week.\nBut the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen.\nPlaid Cymru said a \"stay local\" message was needed for as long as necessary.\nMr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was \"permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise\".\n\"It does mean exercise, not socialising,\" he said.\nThe rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles.\nFrom 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices.\nMore elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered.\nTalks are taking place about reopening tourism in time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority.\nFriday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Wales before Christmas.\nChildren aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - are returning to school from Monday.\nThe next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March.\nThat includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a \"safe and flexible way\", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said.\nShe added there could be some \"flexibility\" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications.\nThe next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March.\nMr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: \"If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'.\"  \nHe said it was \"too uncertain\" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a \"stay local\" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. \nThe managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was \"really happy\" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks.\nBut Sarah Bruton said: \"We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much.\n\"I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet.\"\nBut a caravan park owner said he was \"buzzing\" at the prospect of an Easter reopening.\nEd Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: \"It's the best news we've had all winter.\"\nDiscussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. \nMr Drakeford warned there would not be a \"wholesale\" reopening of shops.\nCardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. \nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly.\n\"I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission.\"\nElsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown \"cautiously\" - a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday.\nIn Northern Ireland lockdown has been extended to 1 April, while in Scotland most lockdown measures are due to remain in place until the end of February.\nSpeaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes.\nHe said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks.\nHe added the hospitality industry did not want a \"stop-start\" reopening: \"They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close.\"\nThere are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales.\nMr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so \"more challenging\".\nBoth gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown, published on Friday.\nThe  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus.\n\"The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,\" the plan said.\nEarlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool.\nThe Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales.\nThe case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas.\nIt now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days.\nWales went into lockdown on 20 December, after a rise in cases blamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus.\nThe rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons.\nPubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut.\nSpeaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being \"baked into what will happen during this year\".\nHe said he was \"not going to say to anybody\" that another lockdown would not be needed.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. \n\"We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway\".\n\"What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work\".\n\"I think that's an opportunity that's been missed\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the \"direction of travel is an incredibly positive one\" but he was still concerned about Covid variants.\n\"We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,\" he said.\n\"The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths\".\n\"So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales\".\nPrior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers.\n\"At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,\" he said.\nWhile Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential \"if reasonably practicable\", English stores can keep them open.\nHow has coronavirus affected you?

And while it's still early days, the data indicates that a first dose of either vaccine prevents most people becoming seriously ill.\nThere are limitations of course. The study only tracked those who were admitted to hospital and whether they had had a vaccine or not.  \nIt didn't count anybody who had died from Covid in a care home, for example.  And it didn't look at transmissibility, only the risk of becoming seriously ill.   \nOther similar studies are being conducted across the UK but this data will be seen as extremely encouraging."

And Boohoo, another fast-growing online retailer, bought Arcadia brands Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton. \nNeither deal included the shops."

      "text": "Italy's ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo has been killed in an attack in the east of the country, its foreign ministry has said.\nLuca Attanasio, 43, died in hospital on Monday after the United Nations convoy he was travelling in came under fire near Goma, a statement said.\nThe convoy reportedly belonged to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).\nAn Italian military police officer travelling with the envoy and a Congolese driver were also killed.\n\"It is with deep sadness that the foreign ministry confirms the death, today in Goma, of the Italian ambassador,\" the ministry's statement said.\nThe attack in North Kivu province is believed to have been an attempted kidnapping, according to officials at the nearby Virunga National Park.\nMr Attanasio was a passenger in one of two vehicles travelling about 15km (nine miles) north of Goma when the attack happened on Monday morning. \nThe vehicles were \"ambushed by a group of six attackers, who fired warning shots before taking all the passengers into the Virunga National Park\", the governor of North Kivu province, Carly Nzanzu, told the BBC.\n\"That's when a patrol of Virunga National Park rangers intervened and managed to free four people,\" he said. \n\"Unfortunately, before they ran away, the assailants shot the ambassador and his bodyguard, and they killed the Congolese driver at the start of the attack,\" the governor added.\nThe WFP said Mr Attanasio was travelling from Goma to visit a \"schools programme\" in the village of Rutshuru in eastern DR Congo. \n\"The attack... occurred on a road that had previously been cleared for travel without security escorts,\" the Rome-based agency said in a statement.\nThe two other fatalities were military police officer Vittorio Iacovacci, 30, who had been serving at the embassy since last September, and their Congolese driver, who has been named as Moustapha Milambo in media reports.\nA number of other passengers were reportedly injured. \nIt is not clear who was behind the attack, but the interior ministry has accused a Hutu rebel group known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). \nMany armed groups are known to operate in and around the park and militias clash regularly in the east of the country, where a large UN force is struggling to keep the peace.\nThe DRC army has deployed troops to help search the area.\nAnalysis by Emery Makumeno, BBC News, Kinshasa \nMr Attanasio is the first ambassador to be killed in the country since French ambassador Philippe Bernard was shot dead during riots in the capital, Kinshasa, in 1997. \nNormally, aid convoys travelling in eastern DR Congo are heavily guarded by UN troops, and questions are bound to be asked about the level of security that Mr Attanasio's convoy had.\nHe was travelling in the east - the most unstable part of DR Congo. Many local armed groups - as well as those from Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Uganda - have established themselves in the region over the last 25 years. \nThe attack highlights the fact that stability to the region will return only if a solution is found to political issues in all these countries. \nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi issued a statement offering his \"deepest condolences\", while President Sergio Mattarella condemned the \"cowardly attack\".\nForeign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed his \"great shock and immense sorrow\" at the \"brutal\" killings.\n\"Today Italy mourns the loss of two of its sons and embraces their families,\" he said, adding: \"No effort will be spared to shed light on what happened.\" \nDR Congo's Foreign Minister, Marie Tumba Nzeza, said an investigation into the killings was under way. \nMr Attanasio had represented Italy in the DR Congo since 2017. He joined the diplomatic service in 2003 and spent time in Morocco and Nigeria.\nDR Congo was for many years at the centre of a brutal civil war that drew in several neighbouring countries. \nThe conflict led to the loss of some five million lives between 1994 and 2003, with some observers branding it Africa's Great War.\nBut the end of the conflict did not mark an end to the violence. Dozens of militias and rebel groups continue to operate in eastern areas.\nThe UN's peacekeeping mission has been in DR Congo since 1999. It is one of the biggest peacekeeping operations in the world, with more than 17,000 personnel on the ground.\nVirunga - which stretches across 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) - is one of the most dangerous parks on the continent.\nIn 2018, a ranger was killed and three people - including two British tourists - were kidnapped when their vehicle was ambushed in the Virunga National Park. Those kidnapped were later released. "

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe prime minister will announce later how England's third national lockdown will end - but those hoping for a quick return to the pub may be disappointed. All schools in England are set to reopen on 8 March, with a few days' flexibility built in. At the same time, two people will be allowed to meet outside in public - for example, for a picnic in a park. Currently, two people can only meet for exercise. By 29 March up to six people, or two households, will be allowed to meet outdoors, including in gardens, it is understood. Grassroots sport will also restart. However, Boris Johnson has said the reopening will be \"cautious\" and will depend on four conditions - including the vaccination programme and any new variants. You can read more about the routes out of lockdown here. And here's a reminder of how Mr Johnson announced the latest lockdown, back on 4 January.\nYounger pupils in Scotland and Wales will begin returning to the classroom today. Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney has insisted it is safe for the reopening to begin - watch his comments below.\nAustralia's government has criticised fans at the Australian Open for booing the mention of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. The booing happened during the awards ceremony at the men's final. Australia is just beginning its national inoculation programme and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack called the crowd's behaviour \"disgusting\". While the vaccine has broad support in Australia, it has also sparked protests. On Saturday, small crowds of anti-vaccination demonstrators marched in cities including Melbourne and Sydney - see footage below.\nMore than half of UK employers intend to recruit in the next three months, according to new research, as the economy slowly reopens. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and recruiter Adecco say about 56% of the 2,000 firms surveyed plan to hire in the first quarter of 2021 - the highest figure in a year. The sectors with the strongest hiring intentions include healthcare, finance and insurance, education and ICT. \"These are the first signs of positive employment prospects that we've seen in a year,\" said the CIPD's Gerwyn Davies.\nOnce limited to bank robbers, eccentric pop stars and health-conscious (and conscientious) Japanese tourists, the wearing of face masks in public is now common enough to be dubbed \"the new normal\". Normal it might be - but it's not new.

      "text": "Much talked-about cryptocurrency Bitcoin has continued to hit record highs having broken through $50,000 (\u00a335,700) last week.\nOn Sunday, Bitcoin hit another peak rising above $58,000 as it continues its strong momentum this year.\nThe cryptocurrency has risen more than 90% since the start of January, pushing its total market value above $1tn.\nThe recent spike has been fuelled by Tesla and other big companies accepting it as payment.\nHowever, Bitcoin has a track record of wild price swings and has fallen sharply a number of times since it was created in 2009.\nBitcoin started the year at roughly $28,900, according to figures from cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk.\nWhen it broke through the $40,000 mark in early January, it triggered a downward trend that saw it drop to around $30,000 by the end of the month.\nHowever, having passed $50,000 on 16 February, it has continued its upward momentum breaking through $58,000 on Sunday.\nThe Bitcoin rally has been largely spurred on by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment.\nElon Musk revealed last week his electric carmaker Tesla had bought $1.5bn worth of Bitcoin and would be accepting it as payment for its cars in future. \nMastercard also plans to accept certain cryptocurrencies as a form of payment while BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is exploring ways it can use the digital currency.\n\"Who's next and what will tip (Bitcoin) over the edge and trigger the next surge?\" said Craig Erlam, an analyst at New York-based foreign-exchange firm Oanda.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has also played its part in Bitcoin's price rise, as more people go online for shopping, moving further away from physical coins and notes. \nBut critics have argued Bitcoin is less of a currency and more of a speculative trading tool that is open to market manipulation.\nProminent economist and Bitcoin critic Nouriel Roubini has said it has very little practical use and doesn't provide a steady income like a bond or a share.\n\"Elon Musk may be buying it but that doesn't mean everyone else should follow suit,\" he tweeted recently. \nNovice investors still need to be aware of the risks involved said Matt Dixon, founder of cryptocurrency rating platform Evai.\nTalking about January's slide from $40,000 to $30,000 in a matter of weeks, he said: \"Though undoubtedly panic-inducing for the uninitiated, this isn't anything particularly remarkable for long-term holders. \n\"New investors need to ensure their hands remain steady to avoid any undue loss from Bitcoin's regular shakeouts. The upside potential may be vast, but the risks can be just as high.\"\nKurt Wuckert is a long-term Bitcoin investor having stumbled upon it in 2012, when he accepted it as payment for a small side project. \n\"I agreed to accept the Bitcoins fully expecting them to be some kind of video game tokens or something, but decided to be cool about it. Then I got to reading about it online and doing my own research.\"\nSince then, he has been regularly investing in the cryptocurrency and considers himself an \"investor in the more proper sense\". \nBut he warns others to do their research first before jumping onto the Bitcoin rollercoaster.\n\"To this day, I tell curious friends to set aside their beer money but not their rent money because it is what I have always done.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Cwmbran,Cardiff,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Secondary school pupils could all be back in school after the Easter break, the Welsh Government says.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said it was \"her preference\" older pupils return after the holidays, which end on 12 April.\nThe news comes as three-to-seven year olds return to classrooms in Wales in a phased return to face-to-face teaching.\nOther primary pupils, and years 11 and 13, are due to return on 15 March if Covid case rates continue to fall.\nHowever, on Anglesey, the return has been delayed until 1 March, with the infection rate on the island the highest in Wales - 112.8 cases per 100,000 people, compared to a national average of 80 per 100,000. \nIn England, all schools are expected to reopen from 8 March, but a more phased approach is planned in Wales.\nMs Williams told a press conference her plans for schools were \"consistent with UK-wide advice\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives said many parents would be \"frustrated\" and questioned why some other sectors, such as non-essential retail, were earmarked for opening before all pupils go back.\nPlaid Cymru backed the phased return, but the NAHT union said suggestions of an Easter return were \"premature\". \nMs Williams had said on Sunday she hoped more pupils would return if cases continued falling.\nMeanwhile, pupils in years 11 and 13, and those in further education settings, will be tested twice a week, alongside education staff.\nThe Covid case rate in Wales is currently 80 per 100,000 people - the lowest of the UK nations - and Wales' R number is between 0.7 and 0.9, Public Health Wales estimates.\nUnder current proposals non-essential Welsh retailers may begin reopening from 15 March, which is before the bulk of secondary school pupils return.\nAsked about this, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government would \"balance needs\" for the entire population when lifting restrictions. \nThe government would \"use what available headroom we have to prioritise children and young people - that will not change\", she said.\nBut, there \"may be other headroom that allows us to do other things\".\nA decision on when older pupils can return will be taken before the Easter holidays.\nStudents in years with exams may return from 15 March, but Ms Williams said it would not \"necessarily be a return to full time on-site learning\".\n\"That potentially is looking at rotas, cutting class sizes, different types of timetabling so that children can get the face to face contact that they need, but looks to minimise the impact of opening up on the overall public health situation,\" the minister added.\nLisa Freeman's four-year-old son Ethan was returning to his reception class at Ysgol Hamadryad in Cardiff.\nShe said he was \"very nervous\" and he did not really talk about going back to school, so they had \"broached the subject slowly\".\n\"He's struggled with the online lessons,\" Ms Freeman said.\n\"I think, as a four-year-old, being sat behind a computer screen has been very difficult for him. He just didn't engage as much as we would have like him to.\"\nMs Freeman said she was concerned there would be further school closures as it had \"very much affected him\".\n\"Hopefully this is the last time - I think it would be really harmful to pull him out of school again,\" she said.\n\"He hasn't left my side since the beginning of December really. I think it's quite frightening, we try to keep the news off as much as possible [around him].\n\"Just to be around his peers I think is huge for his age group.\"\nVictoria Rosser, from Cwmbran, whose five-year-old son will return on Thursday, said she was not sure if it was the right time for children to return.\n\"I'm a little anxious as I'm a shielding parent who hasn't received the second vaccine, however, I feel more confident than I did in September,\" she said.\nMs Rosser, a former teacher, said her son was excited but also \"a little nervous\" to return to school.\n\"Even though he's in Year 1, he's only spent just over half a year in school,\" she said.\n\"Children of similar age, who haven't had the opportunity to learn at home, could have had changes made to their neuro pathways forever. \n\"So even though I'm scared to send my son back to school, I will, because we are yet to learn the damage it has done to them.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said many parents will be \"frustrated\" after hearing that some students will not return to school until after Easter.\nThe party's education spokeswoman Suzy Davie added the Welsh Government \"can't really claim to have school students as its priority when it eases other restrictions before the return of all pupils to the classroom\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price repeated his call for teachers to be vaccinated.\nBut he added: \"I think the Welsh approach, which is also the Scottish and the Northern Irish one, is the right one and that's taking it in a step by step cautious way rather than doing it all at once\".\nBut Laura Doel, director of headteachers union NAHT Cymru, said ministers should guard against moving too quickly.\n\"Given that many schools are only reopening their doors to foundation phase this week, we need to be careful about giving parents and learners false hope,\" she said. \n\"Statements about a full return after Easter are premature and unhelpful at this stage.\"\nThe Welsh Government said under the current circumstances punitive measures, including fines, would not be appropriate.\nIt said some authorities might deem it necessary to pursue \"a small number of cases relating to persistent absence\" which were unrelated to the pandemic and where there were concerns about the welfare of the child. \nTeaching staff will now be tested twice weekly for Covid, and \u00a35m will be spent on face coverings and other equipment.\nTy Golding - head teacher at Ysgol y Ddraig in Llantwit Major and Holton Primary School in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan - said his staff were \"excited\" at returning to school and \"addressing those wellbeing and learning needs\".\nBut he acknowledged some parents and staff still needed reassuring.\n\"The biggest challenge for us - which hopefully will be incident-free and quiet and all about settling back in - is winning hearts and minds in the community with parents and staff, making sure everyone feels safe and secure,\" he told BBC Radio Wales..\nAsked whether he felt teachers and school staff should be prioritised for a Covid-19 vaccine, Mr Golding said he did, adding it was important they felt \"a sense of prioritisation\".\nMinisters said children aged three to seven had been prioritised to return to school first, due to evidence showing Covid spread less quickly among the youngest children, who can also be more difficult to teach remotely.\nThe Welsh Government had said it expected to see pupils returning from Monday but it would be \"done in a phased and progressive way\".\nPrimary schools in some parts of north Wales have said they would not have children back until later in the week, after concerns over higher case rates.\nWrexham, Anglesey, Denbighshire, Gwynedd and Flintshire are delaying the immediate return of younger pupils - with pupils back in class by Friday.\nCeredigion, the county in Wales with the lowest case rate, is also operating a phased return where children will attend for one day in the first week with a full return expected from 3 March.\nMs Williams said at the weekend the next Welsh Government review would look at whether older exam year pupils could return, alongside the remaining primary school year groups. That includes Years 11 and 13, and college students.\nIn the same interview Ms Williams said: \"Our priority will be to use whatever headroom we have to maximise face-to-face learning for Years 11 and 13, and many head teachers that we're consulting with would like some flexibility to get some Year 10 and Year 12 students in as well.\n\"But we might have to do that on a routine basis, allowing us to cut the number of children in the class down, helping to keep those schools as Covid-secure as possible.\"\nMs Williams also said some university students were due to return to campus this week for practical assessments.\nShe said the Welsh Government was working with universities \"to bring back students when it's safe and appropriate to do\"."

When you lose your business, it's terrible, but to lose two of them in one go, it's heart-breaking.\"\nGary Rees employs 12 people at his lorry repair garage in Llanybydder, Carmarthenshire, which was flooded during Storm Callum in 2018, and had come \"within an inch\" of being flooded again on Saturday.\nHe said insurance costs for his business had shot up to \u00a330,000 since the floods in 2018.\n\"Had that flood come in, I would have had no alternative but to close the garage and pack it in,\" he said.\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast, Mr Price said: \"On the evidence of the last few days, once again, the fact that the severity and the frequency of these flooding events should I think convince all of us that flooding needs to become a strategic national priority. \n\"And in particular, we are investing nowhere near what is necessary to provide the level of resilience that is required to our communities.\n\"We need urgency in terms of getting from where we are now to providing the level of investment that for example the National Infrastructure Commission has recommended.\"\nWelsh Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Janet Finch-Saunders said: \"Once again Wales is being hit by flooding, with people's homes and businesses being devastated, and yet very little has happened since the major floods last year to prevent or reduce their impact.\n\"The Welsh Government has had responsibility to protect communities from flooding for 20 years and yet year after year communities continue to be blighted.\n\"We need action not words to prevent flooding in the future.\"\nTheir calls come after 5in (127.6mm) of rain fell at Llyn-y-Fan, Carmarthenshire, between 06:00 on Friday and 08:00 on Saturday, and 4.5in (115mm) at Treherbert in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nThat compares to an average rainfall of 3.9in (98mm) for the whole of February in south Wales.\nOne year ago, communities across the south Wales valleys were devastated by floods caused by Storm Dennis.\nThe Welsh Government said: \"We know major flooding incidents are devastating for communities.\n\"Between 2016 and 2021, Welsh Government invested more than \u00a3390m in helping manage flood risk.\"\nIt said it would \"continue to pro-actively manage and respond to flood risk across Wales\" in line with its new National Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management."

      "title": "Covid: Why can't we unlock more quickly?",
      "tags": "Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The vaccine rollout is going well and cases have plummeted since lockdown began at the start of the year.\nAnd yet the road out of lockdown in England and elsewhere in the UK is slow and gradual.\nMinisters say they want to closely monitor the impact of each step before moving on to the next one. It is a process which will take four months at least.\nWhy is the government being so cautious?\nA key mantra in the lead up to the announcement is that each step forward must be irreversible. There must be no steps back. \nBut despite falling infection rates, the number of new daily cases still remains relatively high compared to summer and early autumn. It is still a very delicate position.\nPlus ministers have certainly been stung by the problems of last year, when the first unlocking saw areas in the North West and Midlands having restrictions quickly re-imposed.\nThen, during the autumn, some areas found themselves constantly moving up and down the tiers.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant such chopping and changing cannot happen again. \"What we want to see is progress that is cautious, but irreversible.\"\nThe government has achieved its target of offering everyone over the age of 70 a jab by mid-February.\nIt means by the time schools open, the most vulnerable people in society should have built up a fair degree of immunity. But that still leaves significant numbers at risk.\nNearly half of those admitted to hospital with Covid are under 70. \nAnd with the numbers in hospital only just below the level they were at during the peak in the first wave, the NHS is not yet out of the woods.\nSchools are not considered a significant driver of infection. Cases still fell in November when England was in lockdown but schools remained open.\nBut there is still a concern re-opening them for all pupils could push up the rates. One of the big unknowns is the new more contagious variant which was not dominant back in November.\nResearch by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has predicted re-opening schools for all could push the R number - the average number of people an infected individual passes the virus on to - above one, prompting a growth in cases.\nThe break at Easter will provide an opportunity to assess the impact of the move - and is why ministers resisted calls to only send some year groups back.\nMutations are to be expected. Growing levels of immunity from further rollout of the vaccine will favour variants that can sneak past the vaccine.\nThat is because of what is known as selection advantage. Viruses change all the time, and the mutations that have an advantage will spread more easily.\nIn the future, when the population has a lot of immunity, mutations that can evade some of the immune response will be in a stronger position to spread.\nThat does not mean the mutations will render the vaccines completely ineffective - coronaviruses are more stable than flu, with which we see different strains circulating each year.\nBut experts have warned everything must be done to guard against mutation at such a delicate time.\nVaccinating when there is a lot of virus circulating is pretty unusual. Normally vaccines are given ahead of exposure.\nScientists believe having high levels of infection at a time when people are building up immunity will encourage mutations even more than normal. That, they warn, would be foolish.\nModelling carried out for the government by Imperial College London has looked at what would happen if there was a quick unlocking.\nIt suggested if restrictions were lifted by the end of April, there could be a surge in deaths in the coming months.\nAnd by next summer another 80,000 Covid fatalities could be seen.\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, says: \"The sooner you open up everything, the greater the risk of a resurgence. The slower the better.\"\nBut such modelling is by its very nature full of uncertainty, because of the assumptions that have to be made.\nFor example, this modelling has not taken into account seasonality.\nWould there really be a surge in the summer when people are outdoors and respiratory viruses tend not to thrive? \nIt is a risk ministers are simply not prepared to take. \nIn taking this approach, though, it is quite conceivable the government could quickly find itself under pressure.\nThe restrictions will continue to have a huge impact on people's lives and livelihoods for months to come.\nIf re-opening schools does not prompt a rise in cases, if the warmer weather helps and the vaccine impact really begins to kick in, infections and hospital admissions could fall to very low levels.\nA key phrase used in the lead up to the roadmap being unveiled was the importance of \"data not dates\".\nThat works both ways.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Huge crowds in Myanmar's capital Nay Pyi Taw have attended the funeral of a young woman killed in protests against a military coup.\nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot in the head just before her 20th birthday, the first of at least three people to die in the protests.\nOn Sunday, thousands lined the streets to honour her, some making the three-fingered salutes used by demonstrators.\nThe military overthrew the elected government earlier this month.\nPromises to hold early elections have failed to satisfy demonstrators, who are also seeking the release of the elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.\nThe military alleges the NLD's landslide election win last year was fraudulent but has not provided proof.\nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing, a supermarket worker, was injured when police tried to disperse protesters earlier this month. She was kept on life support for 10 days but died on Friday.\nShe has become a focal point for demonstrators, with her image often displayed by people resisting the coup.\nHer coffin was driven through the streets in a black and gold hearse, accompanied by hundreds of motorbikes.\nProtesters took to the streets across the country again on Sunday, despite the previous day seeing the worst violence yet in weeks of protests.\nTwo protesters were shot dead when police used live ammunition to disperse crowds. \nThe deaths brought widespread condemnation, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres saying: \"The use of lethal force, intimidation & harassment against peaceful demonstrators is unacceptable.\" \nAlso on Sunday, the wife of prominent actor Lu Min said he had been arrested after posting a video denouncing the military leadership.\nThe two-week-old civil disobedience movement in Myanmar now has its martyrs - represented in posters, paintings and cartoons at rallies which have continued to take place across the country. \nTheir deaths will inflame public anger against the military government, but remind people too of the cost of resisting it. \nThe plan now is to escalate the daily protests into a nationwide general strike, starting next week. \nThis must damage an economy which is already suffering from the Covid pandemic - but its effect on the generals who seized power is harder to predict.\nIn the early hours of Monday, Myanmar entered its second week of nightly internet shutdowns, monitoring group NetBlocks reported.\nThe junta has been regularly blocking the web to try to stifle mass protests.\nEarlier, social media giant Facebook deleted a news site run by the military.\n\"In line with our global policies, we've removed the Tatmadaw True News Information Team Page from Facebook for repeated violations of our Community Standards prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm,\" the company said. \nThe site is the main one run by the military, used to issue warnings to protesters and push its allegations about the election results.\nFacebook is the primary source of information and news in Myanmar. An estimated 22 million of the 54 million people in Myanmar use Facebook.\nThe military's leader Min Aung Hlaing and other top army chiefs are already banned from Facebook over allegations of human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims."

      "text": "The use of a company's cladding at Grenfell Tower was \"an accident waiting to happen\", one of its bosses has agreed at a public inquiry.\nClaude Schmidt said \"maybe yes\" to a barrister's description of the risk.\nMr Schmidt, Arconic's French president, was giving his fifth day of evidence to the Grenfell Tower public inquiry.\nThe inquiry heard that even after the fire, an \"error\" on a draft product certificate for the cladding suggested it could be used on tall buildings.\nMr Schmidt was being questioned by Richard Millett QC, the inquiry's senior counsel, about the weeks after the fire on 14 June 2017, which led to 72 deaths.\nArconic's cladding panels had quickly emerged as a likely cause of the swift spread of flames across Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London.\nOn 26 June, Arconic withdrew the product from the market for buildings taller than 18m, claiming that it had realised it was being \"incorrectly used\", including on Grenfell.\nMr Millett asked him \"isn't the reality that Grenfell, as far as the use of Reynobond PE 55 [cladding] was concerned, that it was an accident waiting to happen and only then did you withdraw it from the market\".\nMr Schmidt's response, as translated from French, was \"maybe yes.\"\nBut he said the company \"were among the only ones to withdraw the product from the market. It was because we couldn't control the supply chain.\"\nArconic's case is that it realised after the fire it could not be sure customers would use its flammable polyethylene version of the cladding safely.\nMr Millett said \"wasn't that all the more reason to stop selling\".\n\"Yes\", Mr Schmidt agreed.\nHe said that the decision not to sell the cladding for high-rise buildings was not made because it was \"inherently dangerous\" but said it did \"have certain characteristics which, if it is used incorrectly, can increase the risk of fire spread\".\nThe inquiry says the cladding was a major cause of the rapid spread of flames during the disaster and this phase of its hearings are determining why it was used.\nThe inquiry has heard, and Mr Schmidt also agreed, that for 12 years before the Grenfell fire, Arconic failed to reveal poor fire test data for the cassette form of its cladding to an important British building industry body.\nThe British Board of Agr\u00e9ment had issued a standards certificate for the product, relied on by the industry, which suggested all versions of the cladding met British standards.\nThis document was sent to the contractors for Grenfell. They selected the Arconic cladding, and a design which would use it in exactly the cassette configuration which the tests suggested would allow fires to spread.\nEven after the fire, a redrafted BBA certificate continued to claim better fire test data than the company had.\nIt also emerged at the inquiry that a BBC investigation into Arconic in 2018 prompted the Board to challenge the cladding firm about what information it had been given.\nThe BBC had discovered the series of poor fire tests reports, commissioned by Arconic, which have been at the heart of this phase of the inquiry.\nThey were carried out in France, but were not published in the UK, and not passed to the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment.\nIn March 2018 the BBC shared them with the Board, which confirmed the information, crucial to the product certificate, had not been handed over.\nChallenged by the BBA, Mr Schmidt said he was \"happy\" to send them.  Brian Moore, from the BBA, responded that it was \"concerning\" to hear that Arconic had the reports.\nBut despite this exchange of emails, they were never handed over, due to legal advice, Mr Schmidt said.\nBy this point, the inquiry, and the police had begun in-depth investigations."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has challenged Alex Salmond to prove there was a conspiracy against him, saying he has made claims \"without a shred of evidence\".\nMr Salmond is due to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry into the government's mishandling of harassment complaints against him later this week.\nHe says he has \"documentary evidence\" of a \"malicious and concerted\" attempt to remove him from public life.\nBut the first minister said any claims of a conspiracy were \"not true\".\nAnd she said Mr Salmond had an \"obligation\" to \"replace the insinuation and assertion we have heard over several months now with evidence\".\nThe Holyrood inquiry was established after the government conceded an internal investigation of two harassment complaints against the former first minister had been \"unlawful\".\nHe was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses following the judicial review case, and was subsequently acquitted of charges of sexual assault in a separate High Court trial.\nIn a written submission published on Monday, Mr Salmond said there had been \"a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned\".\nHe said the government and SNP \"felt threatened\" by the judicial review case, and said he had \"documentary evidence\" that there was a \"fishing expedition to recruit potential complainants\".\nIn other letters to the inquiry he has described the behaviour of the government as a \"disgrace\", accusing it of concealing key evidence from his legal team and of leaking information to the media to damage him.\nHe has also accused Ms Sturgeon of \"repeatedly\" misleading parliament over her meetings with him, making statements which are \"simply untrue\", and of breaking the ministerial code.\nMr Salmond is to give evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday, with Ms Sturgeon expected to face MSPs the following week.\nThe first minister said she hoped Mr Salmond would \"turn up to the committee and bring the claims he has been making out into the open\".\nShe said: \"He appears to be suggesting some kind of conspiracy or concerted campaign against him, without a shred of evidence.\n\"This is his opportunity - because the burden of proof of that lies on him, to replace the insinuation and assertion we have heard over several months now with evidence. \n\"I don't believe he can do that, because I know what he is claiming about a conspiracy is not true.\n\"If he can't substantiate it, it's time for him to stop making these claims - because it's not fair to women first and foremost who came forward with complaints, or the other people who have given years of loyal service to Alex Salmond who he appears to be directing those claims to.\"\nIn an interview with BBC Scotland, the first minister said she would \"stand by what I said in parliament\" about her meetings with Mr Salmond, saying she would \"relish the opportunity\" to go into detail.\nShe said: \"I will set out what I knew and I will set out my recollection of all these things, and answer questions for as long as the committee wants to hear about that.\n\"This is a situation where I and others were faced with a really difficult scenario - allegations against someone I had been very close to. I dealt with that to the best of my ability and I think I made the right judgements overall.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the government \"did make a mistake in the application of its procedure\" for handling complaints, and said it would \"reflect on the lessons of that\".\nBut she insisted the new policy had been drawn up in response to \"the global MeToo movement\", not Mr Salmond.\nThis echoes evidence given to the committee by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans - Scotland's top civil servant - who told MSPs that the government was not out to \"get Alex Salmond\".\nMs Sturgeon said she still had full confidence in Ms Evans, and that she expected her to remain in post for the duration of her current contract."

And Boohoo, another fast-growing online retailer, bought Arcadia brands Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton. \nNeither deal included the shops."

      "title": "Daft Punk announce split after 28 years",
      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Daft Punk, who were responsible for some of the most influential dance tracks of all time, have announced their retirement after nearly 30 years.\nThe duo broke the news in a typically-enigmatic video, titled Epilogue.\nIn the clip, musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, dressed in their iconic robot costumes, bid each other farewell in the desert, before one of them self-destructed.\nThe band's longtime publicist confirmed the split to the BBC.\nFormed in Paris in 1993, the group brought the French underground house scene into the charts with hits like One More Time, Da Funk and Around The World.\nTheir debut album, Homework, is considered a landmark in dance music; while they scored a worldwide hit in 2013 with the retro-disco single Get Lucky, featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers.\nThe song was taken from their most recent record, Random Access Memories, which won the Grammy for album of the year in 2014.\nSince then, the band have kept a relatively low profile - although they collaborated with R&B star The Weeknd on two tracks, Starboy and I Feel It Coming, in 2016.\nFamously publicity-shy, the musicians were seldom seen in public without their robot headgear, and used processed, computerised vocals on almost all of their biggest hits.\n\"We're not performers, we're not models - it would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features,\" de Homem-Christo once told Rolling Stone magazine, \"but the robots are exciting to people.\"\nAs they called time on their career, dozens of artists recognised Daft Punk's impact on dance music. \n\"Eternally grateful,\" wrote Christine and the Queens on Twitter.  \"Thank you Daft Punk for everything! We will miss you!\" added Swedish DJ Alesso. \n\"Thankful to be a part of the journey,\" said The Weeknd on his Instagram Story.\nBangalter and de Homem-Christo met at school in Paris, and began making music together as teenagers alongside Laurent Brancowicz - later of the indie band Phoenix.\nOriginally called Darlin', the trio released some incredibly basic garage rock songs on a UK compilation album, Shimmies In Super 8, in 1993. \nA review in Melody Maker called the music \"a daft punky thrash\" - indirectly christening the band's second incarnation.\nPretty soon, they had abandoned rock for dance music. A subsequent Darlin' song called Untitled 18 sampled David Bowie's Starman and marked their first experimentation with robotic vocals.\nA year later, they passed a cassette of their music to Stuart MacMillan, co-founder of the Scottish techno label Soma, at a rave in Disneyland Paris. On it was the first official Daft Punk song - The New Wave, an uncompromising techno assault on the senses which Soma released in 1994.\nBut it was Da Funk's infectiously zany mix of G-funk and acid house that really put them on the map.\nOriginally pressed in a limited run of 2,000 12-inch records, it was virtually ignored until The Chemical Brothers started playing it in their DJ sets. By the end of 1995, it had sold 30,000 copies and as voted song of the year by French club magazine Soda.\nA record label bidding war ensued, with the band eventually signing to Virgin Records and releasing Homework - recorded in Bangalter's bedroom - in 1996. \nThere was something cartoonish about the band's early singles that compensated for the anonymity of the men behind them. It was an idea compounded by Michel Gondry's mesmerising video for Around The World, where every instrument is represented by a groups of dancers (skeletons represent the guitar line, mummies act out the drum pattern and synchronised swimmers are the synths).\nIt took three years for the band to record a follow-up, during which time Bangalter also scored a major hit - Music Sounds Better with You - with his side project Stardust.\nDiscovery, released in 2001, was almost wilfully anti-cool, steeped in references to 70s disco and 80s crooners. At one point it even samples Barry Manilow's Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed.\nBut the band chopped, spliced, filtered and filleted those sounds to create audacious new songs, with a sense of fun and showmanship that dance music often lacks. If you can listen to the ridiculous guitar arpeggios of Aerodynamic or the party-starting chants of Crescendolls without cracking a smile, they seemed to be saying, maybe it's you who's the robot.\nThe album's most enduring song, however, is Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.  \nBased entirely around Edwin Birdsong's Cola Bottle Baby, a forgotten 70s funk track, it adds a simple vocal line (\"Work it harder, make it better / Do it faster, makes us stronger\") that is twisted and manipulated in increasingly inventive ways until it's barely recognisable as anything but signal noise.\nKanye West later lifted the track and used it as the basis for his own song, Stronger. Daft Punk were unaware of the sample until they heard it on the radio in Los Angeles.\n\"The DJ had made an edit of our song at the beginning and then it turned into his song,\" de Homem-Christo told Billboard in 2007. \n\"Our song had a good sound, but when he put Kanye's record on, the sound was really fat. It sounds really big. It's not a collaboration in the studio, but the vibe of the music we do separately connected in what he did with the song.\"\nAnother four years passed before the release of their third and least essential album, Human After All, after which they wrote the soundtrack to Disney's sci-fi sequel Tron: Legacy.\nThey returned to form with 2013's Random Access Memories - a lush, opulent tribute to the music they grew up with, recorded entirely on live instruments, and featuring guest appearances from Chic's Nile Rodgers, Muppets composer Paul Williams and disco innovator Giorgio Moroder, who narrated his own life story over nine minutes of interlocking dance grooves.\nThe album, which cost more than a million dollars to make, was preceded by the hit single Get Lucky. Speaking to NPR, Bangalter said the song represented the record's theme of connecting the past, present and future of dance music.\n\"It was somehow maybe a child's dream to possibly one day be able to make music with one of the musicians we really love,\" he explained.\n\"So Get Lucky is really about this encounter between Nile [Rodgers] and also Pharrell Williams, [who] we've been friends with and which we've worked with in the past, but about really teaming up and getting outside of our home studio and really reaching out to other musicians and performers and making music and having fun in the studio making music together.\"\nThe album brought the duo to a whole new audience, but now it also appears to be a full stop. The end point in their disco odyssey.\nThe video announcing their split was based on an excerpt from their 2006 film Electroma. \nAs one of the robot bodies disintegrated, a caption appeared stating \"1993 - 2021\". The clip closed with one of the musicians walking into the sunset, accompanied by the song Touch, including the choral refrain: \"Hold on. If love is the answer you're home.\"\nThe band's publicist Kathryn Frazier offered no explanation for the break-up - but fans flooded social media with tributes.\nFrench media tracking service Visibrain said there were 27 tweets posted every second about the band on Monday afternoon.\nPharrell Williams was among them, simply posting the phrase: \"Forever legends\". \n\"Daft Punk left the game with a flawless legacy.

The industry employs millions of people, and Marston's generates about \u00a3500m a year for the government  including direct and indirect taxes, he added. \nOn Monday, rival pub chain Mitchells and Butlers also revealed more of the scale of the challenges it faces.\nThe chain, which runs outlets including Harvesters, O'Neill's and All Bar One, said it was burning through \u00a330-35m a month. \nIt said sales between the end of September and 16 January were 69.8% below last year. It said it had agreed a temporary break from paying into its staff pension funds. \nIt is now in the process of trying to raise \u00a3351m from investors. \nPhil Urban, the company's chief executive, said: \"M&B was a high performing business coming into the pandemic... we have every confidence that we can emerge in a strong competitive position once current restrictions are lifted.\n\"The hospitality industry has done everything that has been asked of it to date and, now that the vaccines are being rolled out and infections are dropping, we are hopeful that pubs and restaurants will soon be allowed to re-open safely so that we can start to serve our customers again.\""

      "tags": "Serious Fraud Office,Barclays,Banking",
      "text": "Tom Hayes, the first banker to be jailed for rigging interest rates, has told the BBC he believes fresh evidence will show his conviction was unsafe. \nIt raises questions about more than 20 other cases and some of the only bankers prosecuted in the UK since the financial crash. \nHis case is now being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said he was found guilty by a jury and the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction.  \n\"I don't blame the jury for it but they were presented with a false narrative and they reached a conclusion based on those facts. I believe had they been presented with full evidence they would have reached a very different conclusion,\" Mr Hayes - who was jailed for 11 years and served five and a half - told the BBC in his first TV interview since being released.  \n\"This wasn't an easy sentence. In that time, I lost my mind, I lost my mental health. I suffered deep bouts of depression. I harboured suicidal thoughts often. I was very angry and bitter. I struggled with my emotions. \n\"Now I sit here in the park and I can smell freedom... but believe me, when you're sitting in a cell for 23 and a half hours a day with two other gentlemen and there's not even room to stand up - that's difficult, very difficult.\"\nThe former UBS trader was found guilty of manipulating Libor, the benchmark that tracks the interest rate banks pay to borrow cash from each other. \nThe new evidence is part of eight grounds of appeal now being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body set up to review allegations of miscarriages of justice. \nIn 2015, the SFO called Tom Hayes the \"ringmaster\" of an international conspiracy to rig interest rates. After a jury returned a guilty verdict, he became the first UK banker to be jailed since the financial crash.\nRulings made prior to his 2015 trial outlawed any consideration of a bank's commercial interests when setting the Libor benchmark. \nThey followed evidence from a key prosecution witness, John Ewan, who said it was against the rules to allow a bank's trading positions to interfere with the process of setting that interest rate and that at no point did he suspect that was taking place.\nMr Hayes says the new evidence, of a conversation involving Mr Ewan at the body that regulates Libor, is in \"stark contrast\" to that testimony.\nThe rulings have since been used by the SFO to prosecute 23 further defendants in subsequent trials for interest-rate rigging. \nHowever, more have been acquitted than convicted as defendants' lawyers questioned if traders' conduct was regarded as unlawful at the time.\nCriminal proceedings have also been issued in the United States against six defendants for the same offence, resulting in four convictions, two of which have been overturned. \nWhat the FTSE or Nikkei are to share prices, Libor is to interest rates - an index that tracks the cost of borrowing cash between the banks. It's used to set interest rates on millions of residential and commercial loans around the world. \nTo work out Libor each day, 16 banks answer a question - at what interest rate could they borrow money? They submit their answers and an average is taken and published as Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate). \nThe evidence against Tom Hayes and other traders consisted of messages and emails asking for those interest rates to be submitted \"high\" or \"low\". \nMr Hayes acknowledges his hope was it might move the Libor average in favour of his bank, UBS, which could make or lose money on trades it had done linked to the Libor rate. \n\"I sent emails and I made phone calls in full knowledge that all of these things were recorded. And I did it with abandon, because I didn't believe I was doing anything wrong,\" he said. \nWhile prosecutors said it was \"self-evidently\" corrupt, a key plank of his defence was that it was normal practice to ask for \"high\" or \"low\" rates - as long as they were still accurate.\nEach day banks were able to borrow at a number of slightly different rates (e.g. Barclays offering 3.18%, HSBC offering 3.20%, Lloyds offering 3.19%), creating a narrow range of rates which were all accurate answers to the Libor question - at what interest rate could you borrow? \nIt was standard industry practice, according to the CCRC application for Mr Hayes, to select a rate within that accurate range best suited to the bank's commercial interests - based, for example, on the trades it had done. That was, according to him and the other defendants in rate-rigging trials, in line with a fiduciary duty they had as part of their jobs to do all they could to maximise revenues and minimise losses for their banks. \nHowever, in his closing speech to the jury, SFO prosecutor Mukul Chawla repeatedly attacked the idea of a range, claiming that \"range\u2026does not exist\". \nPrior to Mr Hayes' trial, presiding judge Mr Justice Jeremy Cooke found that any attempt to influence a Libor submission to suit a bank's commercial interests was in breach of the rules. \nHis finding, upheld by the Court of Appeal, established a precedent which was then used to prosecute 24 money brokers and traders at other banks such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank. \nMr Justice Cooke made his finding after seeing a witness statement from key prosecution witness John Ewan, who previously oversaw the rate-setting process at the British Bankers Association, which owned and supervised Libor. \nMr Ewan's witness statement prior to Mr Hayes' trial stated that attempting to move Libor to help a bank's trades was against the rules. The former Libor manager at the British Bankers Association testified that \"at no point\" did he suspect this was taking place. If he had been aware of it, it would have been investigated and steps taken to stop it.\nBut while in prison Tom Hayes came across a transcript, disclosed in US criminal proceedings but not at his trial. He says it shows taking trades into account was seen as acceptable if the rates submitted were \"representative\" - meaning they reflected the real rates at which banks were offering to lend cash that day.\n\"I was going through piles of paperwork in my cell and I couldn't quite believe what I was reading. \n\"John Ewan said in that conversation: 'I don't know if this is the result of any derivatives trading going on but the rates are representative so from that point of view I'm fine.'\"\n\"Now had commerciality not been allowed in the decision-making process, the moment he knew, or suspected that this was a result of derivatives trading going on, he wouldn't have cared whether the rates were representative or not, he would have straightaway said: 'Well, this is against the rules. I need to investigate.'\n\"It's absolutely in complete contrast to the rulings made by the court, to the evidence given at my trial.\" \nThe BBC offered John Ewan an opportunity to comment but has received no response.\nAt a later trial in early 2017 Mr Ewan acknowledged under cross-examination it was legitimate to set Libor with commercial interests in mind within the range of high or low rates that were \"representative\" of offers in the market.\nThe defendants in that trial were acquitted. \nMr Hayes has filed an application, running to more than 2,300 pages, currently being considered by the CCRC, the body set up to review miscarriages of justice. \nIn it he also questions why key evidence of Bank of England involvement in \"rigging\" Libor was not disclosed at his trial.  \nIn 2017, the BBC discovered a secret recording implicating the Bank of England in rigging Libor in 2007 and 2008, pressuring banks to under-state what they were paying to borrow cash - a practice known as \"low-balling\", for which banks have been fined. It prompted MPs to call for an \"immediate inquiry\".\n\"Unfortunately some of that evidence was not actually in front of my jury,\" Mr Hayes said.\n\"But there was no desire to go after the real story here, which was the low-balling story - which was the submission of false and inaccurate rates - because it was just easier for everyone to go after the traders. At the time it was expedient that, for political reasons, a banker went to prison and I was that banker. I was given an egregious sentence and my life destroyed.\"\nIn 2019, after noting evidence of Bank of England involvement in manipulating Libor, a senior New York judge, Colleen McMahon, gave former Deutsche Bank trader Gavin Black and supervisor Matt Connolly, both convicted by a jury of manipulating Libor, light sentences of \"home confinement\". \n\"At certain times, such as during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, submissions were actually being manipulated at the request of the Bank of England,\" Judge McMahon stated in her sentencing remarks. \nShe later added: \"I'm always uncomfortable when I'm asked in any context - it usually happens in the drug context - to sentence the low man on the totem pole while the big guy goes free.\"\nThe Bank of England has said Libor was not regulated in the UK at the time.\nThe SFO maintained throughout Mr Hayes' trial and subsequent trials between 2016 and 2019 of traders at Barclays and Deutsche Bank that it was investigating low-balling and would pursue the evidence \"as high as it went\". \nHowever in December 2019, it shut down its investigation into low-balling. \nIn a short statement, the SFO said: \"Tom Hayes was found guilty by a jury of manipulating the Libor benchmark, and the Court of Appeal upheld Tom Hayes' conviction.\"\nFollow Andy  on Twitter: @andyverity"

The Joint Unit for Waste Crime is targeting the organised criminal gangs that make millions by dumping waste on an industrial scale.\nA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman said the Environment Agency had been given additional powers and funding.\nHe said: \"We will also reform the licensing system for waste carriers to ensure stricter background and competency checks which, in combination with mandatory electronic waste tracking, will increase compliance and make it harder for criminals to operate.\"\nPanorama: Rubbish Dump Britain is on BBC One at 19:35 GMT on Monday 1 March."

      "text": "All schools in England are going back from 8 March, the prime minister has confirmed, with schools able to decide a phased return during that week.\nThere will be mass Covid testing in secondary schools - with parents expected to carry out the testing at home, after three tests in school.\nHome testing for secondary pupils will be twice weekly - but with no testing so far planned for primary pupils.\nFace masks will also be required in some secondary school classrooms.\nAttendance will be compulsory when schools go back, with penalty fines able to be imposed.\n\"All the evidence shows that schools are safe and the risk posed to children by Covid is vanishingly small,\" the Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a press conference on Monday evening.\n\"But to offer even greater reassurance we're introducing twice weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils and asking them to wear face coverings for the rest of this term.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"the priority must be for all children to be back in school as quickly as possible and to stay in school\".\nBut Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, warned getting all pupils back at the same time \"runs the risk of increasing the rate of infection and prolonging the damaging cycle of stop-start schooling\".\nIndividual schools can decide on testing arrangements and how year groups go back during the week, but Mr Barton suggested it could need to be staggered over two weeks.\nUK chief medical adviser Chris Whitty emphasised his support for the return to school - and that the benefits outweighed any \"very small residual risk\".\n\"Everything is strongly in favour of children, whether primary or secondary, going to school - and the data on that I think are unambiguous,\" he said.\nProf Whitty said there were extra safety measures in place for this reopening - with testing, the greater use of masks and an early \"natural fire break\" of the Easter holidays.\nAfter three Covid tests in secondary school and one home test, there will be twice-weekly tests carried out by parents and carers at home.\nThe tests are voluntary and will operate \"based on trust\", officials said. \nBut it remains uncertain how parents will feel about carrying out the lateral flow tests, which are usually swab tests, taking a sample from the back of the throat or from the nose.\nSchools will continue to provide some testing facilities for those children whose parents might not be able to carry out testing.\nWhen schools return, face masks will be required in some secondary and further education classrooms, at least for the rest of this term.\nThe Department for Education said there would be a requirement to \"wear face coverings indoors, including classrooms\" where social distancing of two metres cannot be maintained.\nBut the National Deaf Children's Society warned that face masks in the classroom will have a \"devastating effect\" on deaf children's ability to take part in lessons.\nStaff in primary school will be expected to wear face masks in corridors and communal areas \"where social distancing between adults is not possible\".\nThe return for all schools and colleges will be from the week starting 8 March.\nSchools will be able to decide how the return will be organised, with discretion over a phased return for the first week, such as the whether some year groups are brought back earlier.\nBut an alliance of teachers' and head teachers' unions warned that sending back 10 million children and school staff at the same time was \"reckless\" and risked triggering a fresh wave of infections.\nA Sage scientific advisory group meeting from 28 January, with minutes published on Monday, cautioned with \"medium confidence\" that the \"opening of primary and secondary schools is likely to increase effective R by a factor of 1.1 to 1.5 (10% to 50%)\".\nThe National Education Union said the reopening plan showed the prime minister, \"despite all his words of caution, failed to learn the lessons of his previous mistakes\". \nMary Bousted, joint leader of  the biggest teachers' union, said: \"It remains the case, unfortunately, that cases are three times higher now than when schools re-opened last September.\"\nAnother \u00a3300m has been added to the \u00a31bn catch-up funding announced last year, in recognition of the amount of time pupils will have missed in school.\nThere will be future announcements on how this is likely to be spent, such as on summer clubs, tutoring, after-school lessons, activities and sports.\nA school catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, has been appointed to lead on this recovery, with particular concerns about the biggest negative impact falling on the most disadvantaged.  \nCancelled GCSEs and A-levels are going to be replaced by teachers' grades, with more details expected on Thursday.\nThere will be \"mini-exams\" which are intended to \"inform\" the judgements made by teachers, rather than be used to decide results.\nThe mini-exams will be marked by teachers within schools and are likely to be options for schools to use to assess pupils, rather than being compulsory.\nResults could be published earlier than usual, allowing more time for appeals ahead of university admissions.\nVocational exams are also expected to use teachers' grades, but with different arrangements for qualifications requiring practical skills.\nFace-to-face teaching remained open for university students taking hands-on subjects, such as medicine, while other courses have switched online.\nA wider range of these practical subjects will return from March 8. But no date has been decided for when most other courses will return to face-to-face teaching.\nThe prime minister said a decision would be announced by the end of the Easter holidays, which would be in late April, with students promised at least a week's notice of any return to in-person teaching on campus.\nThis could hold out the prospect of a return in the summer term. But a number of universities have already announced they will stay online for most courses for the rest of the academic year."

And while it's still early days, the data indicates that a first dose of either vaccine prevents most people becoming seriously ill.\nThere are limitations of course. The study only tracked those who were admitted to hospital and whether they had had a vaccine or not.  \nIt didn't count anybody who had died from Covid in a care home, for example.  And it didn't look at transmissibility, only the risk of becoming seriously ill.   \nOther similar studies are being conducted across the UK but this data will be seen as extremely encouraging."

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Human rights,Myanmar,Belarus,Dominic Raab,China,Russia,United Nations",
      "text": "UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has called on the leaders of Myanmar's military coup to release democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\nIn a speech, Mr Raab called on the military to \"step aside\" and respect Myanmar's democratic process.\nIt comes after at least two people were killed in protests against the coup - the worst violence yet in more than two weeks of demonstrations.\nHowever, tens of thousands have come out to protest on Monday. \nThe demonstrations - nicknamed the \"22222 Revolution\" - come despite a thinly-veiled threat by the military read out on a state-run broadcaster that protesters were heading down a path \"where they will suffer loss of life\". \nMilitary leaders overthrew Ms Suu Kyi's elected government and have placed her under house arrest, charging her with possessing illegal walkie-talkies and violating the country's Natural Disaster Law.\nProtesters are demanding an end to the military action and want her released along with senior members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. \nReacting to the two protesters' deaths on Twitter, Mr Raab said: \"We will consider further action, with our international partners, against those crushing democracy and choking dissent.\"\nHe added that the shooting of peaceful protesters was \"beyond the pale\".\nSpeaking to the United Nations Human Rights Council later, Mr Raab said the situation in Myanmar, also known as Burma, is getting worse, with human rights violations and abuses \"well-documented\".\nHe said the crisis \"presents an increased risk to the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities\", and called for civilian leaders such as Ms Suu Kyi to be released.\nThe foreign secretary also called for the UN to have \"urgent and unfettered\" access to investigate human rights abuses against people in camps in China.\nAnd he criticised Russia for what he called the \"disgraceful\" jailing of the opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. \n\"His treatment and the violence inflicted on peaceful protesters can only further reinforce the world's concerns that Russia is failing to meet its international obligations,\" Mr Raab said.\nChina and Russia are both members of the UN Human Rights Council.\nThe council was set up in 2006 to replace the UN Commission on Human Rights, which faced widespread criticism for letting countries with poor human rights records become members.\nThe council meets three times a year, and reviews the human rights records of all UN members as well as setting up commissions of inquiry to report on human rights violations in countries including Myanmar, Syria, North Korea, Burundi and South Sudan.\nHuge crowds have turned out in cities across Myanmar on Monday, as part of a general strike called against the military coup.\nThompson Chau, editor of local media outlet Frontier, told the BBC's World Service that today's protests \"feel a lot bigger than before, with more roads blocked, highways blocked and shops closed everywhere we go\".\n\"Today is more of a huge strike in a sense that everyone is not going to work. All the shops are closed.\"\nMr Chau adds that even those working for \"official state companies, reporting and tax departments, government doctors, engineers\", are all going on strike. \nThere have been no reports of violence today, despite the stern warnings delivered by the military.\nMonday's protest, which has been nicknamed the \"22222 Revolution\", a reference to the digits in the date (22/02/2021), is being compared by protesters to demonstrations on 8 August 1988, known also as the 8888 uprising.\nOn that day, the Burmese military cracked down on anti-government demonstrations, killing hundreds of protesters. For many, the date is seen as a watershed moment in Myanmar. "

      "tags": "HIV & Aids,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "People living with HIV in England and Wales can now choose to have their Covid vaccine through specialist clinics, without notifying their GP.\nNHS England has updated its guidance for people not comfortable with sharing their status.\nEveryone with HIV should be in vaccine priority groups four or six, and offered a jab by mid-April at the latest. \nBut campaigners worried stigma would cause some to miss out. \nThe updated guidance, obtained by the i newspaper, follows the lead of NHS Wales which put the same measures in place last week. \nHead of leading HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, Ian Green, said: \"Some may be surprised to hear that a significant number of people living with HIV feel unable to talk to their GP about their HIV status, but this underlines how much stigma still surrounds the virus even in 2021. \n\"This is great news and the right decision from the NHS as it means people living with HIV will be able to take up the potentially life-saving Covid-19 vaccine at their earliest opportunity.\n\"We are working towards a society where everyone living with HIV feels comfortable sharing their status with their doctor and other health professionals, but we're not there yet and we welcome this fast, pragmatic action.\"\nNHS England's LGBT health advisor Dr Michael Brady said he encouraged everyone living with HIV to \"register with a GP and make them aware of their HIV diagnosis so they get the best possible health care\".\nBut, \"for those not comfortable doing this\", local HIV clinics would now be able to arrange a vaccine through an alternative route. \nNHS England said due to \"sensitivities and stigma\" still surrounding HIV, an estimated one in five people with the virus were not sharing their status with their GP.\nStephen Doughty MP, the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on HIV/Aids, welcomed the changes in England and Wales but said he now hoped there would be \"urgent clarity on whether Scottish and Northern Irish ministers will follow suit\". \nThose at highest risk in group four - people with shielding letters - should have already been offered a vaccination appointment. \nThat might include people with a high viral load, low white blood cell count, a recent HIV-related illness or chronic condition. \nEveryone else with HIV should automatically fall into priority group six, meaning they should be invited for a jab by mid-April at the latest. \nThe Department of Health and Social Care recommends the Covid vaccine for everyone with HIV, regardless of their white blood cell count. \nBut guaranteeing the offer of an appointment had previously relied on GPs being aware of their patient's HIV diagnosis.\nThe change in guidance means local specialist HIV clinics can refer people directly to a vaccination centre or local hospital hub. \nThe vaccines do not cause any live virus and so do not present any risk to people with compromised immune systems. \nSome vaccinations produce a \"weaker\" effect in people with HIV, according to the British HIV Association, because the body's immune response is compromised.\n\"We do not yet know if this is the case for the Covid-19 vaccines but they are expected to be protective in people with HIV and are recommended,\" the association's guidelines state."

That includes doing the right thing and waiting your turn.\"\nThe executive is due to publish a pathway to recovery for coming out of lockdown.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the NI executive had been watching what other parts of the United Kingdom were doing.\nShe said she would be looking at the impact the reopening of schools in  Scotland and Wales had on the reproduction (R) number.\nShe also said she would follow England's plan closely as \"our transmission rates are probably similar to theirs and we will want to take that into account\".\n\"What I must do is make sure that we don't go back into lockdown again and that of course is a balancing act,\" she said.\n\"We have to do it in a way that makes sure that we don't step back again.\""

The industry employs millions of people, and Marston's generates about \u00a3500m a year for the government  including direct and indirect taxes, he added. \nOn Monday, rival pub chain Mitchells and Butlers also revealed more of the scale of the challenges it faces.\nThe chain, which runs outlets including Harvesters, O'Neill's and All Bar One, said it was burning through \u00a330-35m a month. \nIt said sales between the end of September and 16 January were 69.8% below last year. It said it had agreed a temporary break from paying into its staff pension funds. \nIt is now in the process of trying to raise \u00a3351m from investors. \nPhil Urban, the company's chief executive, said: \"M&B was a high performing business coming into the pandemic... we have every confidence that we can emerge in a strong competitive position once current restrictions are lifted.\n\"The hospitality industry has done everything that has been asked of it to date and, now that the vaccines are being rolled out and infections are dropping, we are hopeful that pubs and restaurants will soon be allowed to re-open safely so that we can start to serve our customers again.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Universities in the UK,Universities,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All schools in England are going back from 8 March, the prime minister has confirmed, with schools able to decide a phased return during that week.\nThere will be mass Covid testing in secondary schools - with parents expected to carry out the testing at home, after three tests in school.\nHome testing for secondary pupils will be twice weekly - but with no testing so far planned for primary pupils.\nFace masks will also be required in some secondary school classrooms.\nAttendance will be compulsory when schools go back, with penalty fines able to be imposed.\n\"All the evidence shows that schools are safe and the risk posed to children by Covid is vanishingly small,\" the Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a press conference on Monday evening.\n\"But to offer even greater reassurance we're introducing twice weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils and asking them to wear face coverings for the rest of this term.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"the priority must be for all children to be back in school as quickly as possible and to stay in school\".\nBut Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, warned getting all pupils back at the same time \"runs the risk of increasing the rate of infection and prolonging the damaging cycle of stop-start schooling\".\nIndividual schools can decide on testing arrangements and how year groups go back during the week, but Mr Barton suggested it could need to be staggered over two weeks.\nUK chief medical adviser Chris Whitty emphasised his support for the return to school - and that the benefits outweighed any \"very small residual risk\".\n\"Everything is strongly in favour of children, whether primary or secondary, going to school - and the data on that I think are unambiguous,\" he said.\nProf Whitty said there were extra safety measures in place for this reopening - with testing, the greater use of masks and an early \"natural fire break\" of the Easter holidays.\nAfter three Covid tests in secondary school and one home test, there will be twice-weekly tests carried out by parents and carers at home.\nThe tests are voluntary and will operate \"based on trust\", officials said. \nBut it remains uncertain how parents will feel about carrying out the lateral flow tests, which are usually swab tests, taking a sample from the back of the throat or from the nose.\nSchools will continue to provide some testing facilities for those children whose parents might not be able to carry out testing.\nWhen schools return, face masks will be required in some secondary and further education classrooms, at least for the rest of this term.\nThe Department for Education said there would be a requirement to \"wear face coverings indoors, including classrooms\" where social distancing of two metres cannot be maintained.\nBut the National Deaf Children's Society warned that face masks in the classroom will have a \"devastating effect\" on deaf children's ability to take part in lessons.\nStaff in primary school will be expected to wear face masks in corridors and communal areas \"where social distancing between adults is not possible\".\nThe return for all schools and colleges will be from the week starting 8 March.\nSchools will be able to decide how the return will be organised, with discretion over a phased return for the first week, such as the whether some year groups are brought back earlier.\nBut an alliance of teachers' and head teachers' unions warned that sending back 10 million children and school staff at the same time was \"reckless\" and risked triggering a fresh wave of infections.\nA Sage scientific advisory group meeting from 28 January, with minutes published on Monday, cautioned with \"medium confidence\" that the \"opening of primary and secondary schools is likely to increase effective R by a factor of 1.1 to 1.5 (10% to 50%)\".\nThe National Education Union said the reopening plan showed the prime minister, \"despite all his words of caution, failed to learn the lessons of his previous mistakes\". \nMary Bousted, joint leader of  the biggest teachers' union, said: \"It remains the case, unfortunately, that cases are three times higher now than when schools re-opened last September.\"\nAnother \u00a3300m has been added to the \u00a31bn catch-up funding announced last year, in recognition of the amount of time pupils will have missed in school.\nThere will be future announcements on how this is likely to be spent, such as on summer clubs, tutoring, after-school lessons, activities and sports.\nA school catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, has been appointed to lead on this recovery, with particular concerns about the biggest negative impact falling on the most disadvantaged.  \nCancelled GCSEs and A-levels are going to be replaced by teachers' grades, with more details expected on Thursday.\nThere will be \"mini-exams\" which are intended to \"inform\" the judgements made by teachers, rather than be used to decide results.\nThe mini-exams will be marked by teachers within schools and are likely to be options for schools to use to assess pupils, rather than being compulsory.\nResults could be published earlier than usual, allowing more time for appeals ahead of university admissions.\nVocational exams are also expected to use teachers' grades, but with different arrangements for qualifications requiring practical skills.\nFace-to-face teaching remained open for university students taking hands-on subjects, such as medicine, while other courses have switched online.\nA wider range of these practical subjects will return from March 8. But no date has been decided for when most other courses will return to face-to-face teaching.\nThe prime minister said a decision would be announced by the end of the Easter holidays, which would be in late April, with students promised at least a week's notice of any return to in-person teaching on campus.\nThis could hold out the prospect of a return in the summer term. But a number of universities have already announced they will stay online for most courses for the rest of the academic year."

      "tags": "Space exploration,United States",
      "text": "The first bone cancer survivor to become an astronaut. The first person with a prosthetic body part to visit space. And the youngest American ever to orbit Earth.\nThese are the impressive firsts that could soon be attributable to 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. \nIn January, the physician assistant was picked to join the crew of the world's first all-civilian space mission.\nMs Arceneaux was ecstatic but, at first, she had to keep her lips sealed. \n\"I've held onto the biggest secret of my life for a month and a half. So now I get to share it with the world,\" she told the BBC.\nHer selection for the historic mission was announced on Monday by the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where Ms Arceneaux was once a cancer patient as a child and now works.\nLater this year, she will launch from Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket made by SpaceX, the company founded by business mogul Elon Musk.\n\"I think this mission is going to inspire people in so many ways,\" Ms Arceneaux said. \"It shows them that anything is possible.\"\nThere will be no professional astronauts on board the spacecraft.\nRather, Ms Arceneaux will be joined by two contest winners and flight commander Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire who is paying for the entire mission.\nThe mission is the pet project of Mr Isaacman, who announced on 1 February that he had bought the rocket launch.\nMr Isaacman is aiming to use the flight to raise $200m (\u00a3142m) for St Jude, half of which he said he will donate himself.\nOf the four available seats on the spacecraft, one was offered to a member of staff at the hospital.\n\"From the start, we wanted a crew member that represented the mission's spirit of hope,\" Mr Isaacman said. \"I can't think of a better person than Hayley to fulfil that responsibility.\"\nFor Ms Arceneaux, the flight will be the realisation of a feat she never thought was possible.\nAt the age of 10, Ms Arceneaux was a bone cancer patient at St Jude. \nAs part of her treatment at the hospital, Ms Arceneaux had chemotherapy and surgery to replace some of her leg bones with artificial ones.\nIn a different era, Ms Arceneaux's prosthetic leg bones would have grounded her ambitions for space travel as a Nasa astronaut, because of the agency's strict medical requirements.\nBut the emergence of private space missions in recent years has enabled more of us to reach for the stars.\n\"Until this mission, I could have never been an astronaut,\" Ms Arceneaux said. \"This mission is opening space travel to people who are not physically perfect.\"\nMs Arceneaux was at home in Tennessee when she got the \"out of the blue\" call on 5 January asking if she would join the mission.\nHer response? \"Immediately, I said, 'yes, yes please'.\"\nAfter checking with her family to \"make sure they were not adamantly opposed\", and her brother and sister-in-law who - as aerospace engineers - \"really reassured me how safe space travel is\", she agreed to join the crew.\nMr Isaacman is planning to select and reveal the remaining two crew members by March.\nOne will be the winner of a sweepstake competition, whose proceeds will be donated to St Jude. \nThe other will go to the winner of a contest which asks entrepreneurs to design an online store using software made by Shift4, Mr Isaacman's payment technology company.\nOnce selected, the crew will undergo a rigorous, months-long training programme, including mission simulations in zero gravity. \nMs Arceneaux -  the flight's medical officer - has already tried on her space suit. It was \"so cool\" but \"heavier than I expected\", she said.\nShe will presumably get used to it by the time the rocket lifts off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, sometime at the latter end of 2021.\nThen, Ms Arceneaux will be wearing the suit for several days as her spacecraft - a SpaceX Dragon capsule - circles the globe.\nAt the end of the mission, the Dragon will re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a soft-water landing off the east coast of the US.\nAre Ms Arceneaux's nerves jangling?\n\"I'm really not nervous. I've met the lead engineers for every aspect of this mission. I really trust them.\"\nCompared to what she went through as a child, space travel should be no problem.\n\"Getting to represent cancer patients and survivors is an incredible honour. It really wasn't that long ago that I was in their shoes,\" she said.\n\"When you're going through cancer treatment, you're so focused on the day-to-day. It can be really difficult to look toward the future. I hope that this mission will allow them to imagine their future.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality will reopen on 12 April in England if strict conditions are met, under plans set out by the PM earlier. Boris Johnson's four-step roadmap for ending lockdown means that up to six people from separate households could be able to meet in beer gardens from 12 April, while all legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June. It requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage. Mr Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be \"cautious but irreversible\" and at every stage decisions would be led by \"data not dates\". You can read more about the timetable for easing measures here. \nThe first results of the UK's vaccination rollout suggests it is having a \"spectacular\" impact on preventing serious illness from coronavirus. Research led by Public Health Scotland found that at four weeks after the first dose, Covid hospital admissions were reduced by 85% for the Pfizer jab, and 94% for the AstraZeneca jab. Lead researcher Prof Aziz Sheikh said the results were \"very, very\" impressive and both vaccines were working \"spectacularly\". Figures for England are expected to be released later. Meanwhile, people living with HIV in England and Wales can now choose to have their Covid jab through specialist clinics, without notifying their GP, under updated guidance by NHS England.\nIn his statement to MPs, Mr Johnson confirmed that schools in England will reopen on 8 March, with individual schools allowed to decide a phased return in that week. Sean Coughlan, the BBC's family and education correspondent, runs through what we can expect when schools reopen. There will be mass Covid testing in secondary schools - with parents expected to carry out the swabs at home twice a week, after three tests in school. Face coverings will also be required in some secondary school classrooms. There are as yet no plans so far for primary school pupils to be tested. Younger pupils in Scotland and Wales began returning to the classroom today. In Northern Ireland, pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school.\nA \"small family funeral\" for Captain Sir Tom Moore will take place on Saturday, as his daughters urged the public to support the NHS by staying at home. The 100-year-old Army veteran, who raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died in Bedford Hospital on 2 February after testing positive for Covid-19. Under the current rules, the funeral will be attended by eight members of Capt Sir Tom's immediate family - his two daughters, Lucy Teixeira and Hannah Ingram-Moore, four grandchildren and his sons-in-laws. Members of the Armed Forces will perform ceremonial duties at the funeral.\nIn news that will delight sports fans, the government's four-part roadmap also includes plans for up to 10,000 spectators to return to stadiums by mid-May. The PM told MPs earlier: \"The turnstiles of our sports stadia will once again rotate.\" The government says it will run a series of 'pilot' events for a small number of fans to attend in April. If successful, \"up to 10,000 people or 25% of total seated capacity, whichever is lower\" will be allowed in stadiums for sporting events, but not before 17 May. Meanwhile, outdoor sports including football, golf and tennis will be allowed to resume in England from 29 March.

      "text": "Matt Hancock says it was \"the right thing to do\" to delay publishing contracts during the pandemic, despite a court ruling he acted unlawfully.\nA judge ruled the health secretary had \"breached his legal obligation\" by not publishing details within 30 days of contracts being signed.\nBut Mr Hancock told the BBC his team had been focused on sourcing PPE.\nHe said they \"spent all of their time buying life-saving equipment, even if the paperwork was a little bit late\". \nBut one of the MPs who supported the legal action - the Green Party's Caroline Lucas - said Mr Hancock's response made her angry. \nShe tweeted: \"How dare Hancock suggest he broke [the] law to prevent shortages of PPE on the frontline? \n\"Health workers died for lack of [the] right PPE at [the] right time because of incompetence, cronyism and waste - does he think our memories are so short?\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would not call for Mr Hancock to resign over the court ruling, saying it was \"not what the public really want to see\".\nBut he told Sky News there had been \"a lot of problems... on transparency and on who the contracts went to\", as well as \"a lot of wasted money [which is] a real cause for concern\". \nOther Labour MPs have said the health secretary should quit, including Nadia Whittome, who tweeted: \"In what other job could you break the law and be let off?\"\nThe health secretary earlier told Sky News the issue had been \"put right over the summer\", and he committed to publishing \"what is legally required and what is normal to publish\" going forward.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) struck deals worth hundreds of millions of pounds during the coronavirus pandemic.\nCampaign group the Good Law Project took legal action against the Department of Health - supported by three MPs Ms Lucas, Labour's Debbie Abrahams and Lib Dem Layla Moran - over its \"wholesale failure\" to disclose details of the contracts agreed.\nUnder the law, the government is required to publish a \"contract award notice\" within 30 days of the awarding any contracts for public goods or services worth more than \u00a3120,000.\nBut in his ruling, Mr Justice Chamberlain said: \"There is now no dispute that, in a substantial number of cases, the secretary of state breached his legal obligation to publish contract award notices within 30 days of the award of contracts.\n\"There is also no dispute that the secretary of state failed to publish redacted contracts in accordance with the transparency policy.\"\nThe judge called it an \"historic failure\" by the department, adding: \"The public were entitled see who this money was going to, what it was being spent on and how the relevant contracts were awarded.\"\nAsked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if he would apologise following the ruling, Mr Hancock said the contracts had been published \"just after a fortnight late\" on average, \"because my team were working seven days a week, often 18 hours a day, to get hold of the equipment that was saving lives\".\nThe health secretary said \"of course contracts like this need to be published\" and the judge's comments about ensuring transparency were \"100% right\".\nBut he said: \"People can make up their own view about whether I should have told my team to stop buying PPE and spend the time bringing forward those transparency returns by just over a fortnight or whether I was right to buy the PPE and get it to the frontline. \n\"You tell me that that's wrong. You can't and the reason you can't is because it was the right thing to do and legal cases about timings of transparency returns are completely second order compared to saving lives.\"\nMr Hancock added: \"There is no health secretary in history that would have taken the view that they need to take people off the project of buying PPE in order to ensure nine months later the health secretary didn't have a slightly bumpy interview on the Marr programme. \n\"It is not what it is about, it is about doing the right thing.\"\nBut shadow justice secretary David Lammy called on Mr Hancock to come to Parliament and explain how he would make the system more transparent. \nHe told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the government should cancel the temporary rules put in place during the pandemic to speed up government procurement contracts.\nAnd he accused Mr Hancock of using the emergency measures \"without any accountability or any transparency\" - calling his actions \"outrageous\"."

      "tags": "Iran,Iran nuclear deal,Nuclear weapons",
      "text": "Iran and the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, have agreed to temporary measures to offset Iran's decision to restrict access to inspectors. \nThese would enable the agency to retain the \"necessary degree of monitoring and verification work\", IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said, without going into detail. \nThe move comes ahead of a deadline set by Iran to stop intrusive checks of sites unless US sanctions are lifted.\nTensions have soared since the US left a nuclear deal with Iran in 2018.\nThen-President Donald Trump reimposed crippling economic sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran refused and retaliated by rolling back a number of key commitments. \nThe crisis over Iran's nuclear programme has been on the international agenda for almost 20 years. Iran says the programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and others suspect Iran has ambitions to develop nuclear weapons.\nIran is a nuclear worry: Some countries have long suspected that Iran has secret ambitions to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this.\nSo a deal was struck: In 2015 a major agreement between Iran and six other countries meant Iran accepted limits on its nuclear activities in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, that hurt its economy.\nWhat is the problem now? Iran re-started banned nuclear work after former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move.\nThe \"temporary technical\" arrangement reached between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \"salvages the situation\", Mr Grossi told reporters on Sunday after a visit to Iran.\n\"We were able to retain the necessary degree of monitoring and verification work,\" he said, without elaborating, but added: \"There is less access [to Iranian sites], let's face it.\"\nUnder the plan, for the next three months Iran would hold recordings from monitoring equipment installed at sites by the IAEA but would not release the information unless sanctions were lifted within that timeframe, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) said. If sanctions remained, the data would be erased, it added.\nCameras and other apparatus have been put in place by the IAEA to help verify that Iran does not carry out nuclear activities prohibited under the deal.\nHowever, Iran and the US are at loggerheads over the removal of sanctions. Washington insists Tehran must return to full compliance with the 2015 deal first, while Tehran says that will only happen once sanctions are lifted.\nAnalysis by Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic correspondent\nThe IAEA's boss, Rafael Grossi, called this \"a good result\".\nIt certainly seems likely to defuse a mounting sense of crisis surrounding Iran's nuclear activities and efforts to breathe new life into the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.\nCrucially, it significantly reduces the impact of a new Iranian law, due to come into effect on Tuesday, which would have seriously hampered the IAEA's ability to do its work.\nIran will still suspend implementation of the so-called Additional Protocol, which gives the IAEA substantially enhanced tools with which to carry out inspections.\nBut Mr Grossi clearly believes the \"temporary bilateral technical understanding\" reached after talks in Tehran this weekend will allow his inspectors to continue doing their job to a satisfactory degree.\nThe deal will have its sceptics, particularly among those for whom the JCPOA was always a mistake, and who also believe it's pointless, or even dangerous, to try and rescue it.\nBut coming at a time when the Biden administration has indicated its willingness to return to the negotiating table, this deal buys some precious time.\nA law is due to come into force on Tuesday in Iran requiring the government to stop allowing the inspection at short-notice of declared or undeclared nuclear sites by IAEA experts.\nIran had agreed to allow the resumption of snap inspections - a voluntary measure - under the 2015 deal, having previously suspended them in 2006. \nLess intrusive routine inspections of declared nuclear sites will continue - and Iran has said the new law will not lead to the expulsion of inspectors.\nHowever, the abandonment by Iran of another commitment will heighten international alarm.\nIn the short term, Iran wants to put further pressure on the US and other parties to the JCPOA - France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China - to get Washington to lift sanctions on Iran's oil, banking and financial sectors.\nIran has increasingly stopped complying with its obligations under the 2015 deal since the US withdrew, deepening concern among the remaining members that its resumption of banned activities could ease the path towards a bomb.\nLast month, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said he believed it would currently take Iran \"a few months\" to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so. But he warned that it \"could get down to a matter of weeks\" if Iran continued to lift some of the restraints imposed by the deal.\nRecent Israeli assessments suggest it would take Iran about two years to develop a deliverable device."

      "text": "The first data on the UK Covid vaccine rollout suggests it is having a \"spectacular\" impact on stopping serious illness, researchers say.\nWithin weeks, one shot reduces the risk of being admitted to hospital by at least three-quarters for the over 80s.\nResearchers said this was particularly impressive as this age group was the most frail and least likely to have a strong immune response.\nMonitoring of health staff also shows vaccination helps cut transmission.\nSo far a third of adults have received a vaccination in the UK.\nBut questions had been raised about the policy of leaving a gap of three months between first and second doses.\nThe data from Public Health England (PHE) and Public Health Scotland (PHS) has been published on the day the government in England has set out its roadmap for lifting restrictions.\nThe research was carried out separately in the two nations, but both studies involved tracking those who had been vaccinated and comparing them against people who had not been.\nThe PHS study found that, by the fourth week after the first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines, the risk of being admitted to hospital had been reduced by 81%.\nIt was slightly higher when younger age groups were included.\nLead researcher Prof Aziz Sheikh said the results were \"very, very\" impressive and both vaccines were working \"spectacularly\".\n\"These results are very encouraging and have given us great reasons to be optimistic for the future,\" he added.\nIn England researchers followed up those who were vaccinated to see if they became ill, needed to be admitted to hospital and whether they died.\nThe cut off was two weeks after being given a Pfizer vaccine.\nIt found vaccination reduced the risk of symptomatic infection by 57%; for those infected the risk of being admitted to hospital was reduced by 40% and then if people were admitted to hospital it reduced the risk of dying by 56%.\nOverall this meant, the team said, the risk of being admitted to hospital and dying was reduced by at least 75%.\nThe PHE team was also able to get an idea of what the vaccine was doing in terms of slowing the spread of the virus.\nHealth staff who were vaccinated were routinely tested every two weeks whether or not they had symptoms.\nOne dose reduced the risk of catching the infection by 70% - if an individual is not infected they cannot pass it on.\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations of PHE, said: \"We should be very encouraged by these initial findings.\"\nAnd she added the findings for the over 80s were particularly impressive as they were the frailest people who are perhaps least likely to have a strong immune response. \nTrials of both vaccines had suggested they would have a significant impact at preventing hospitalisations.\nBut for the Pfizer vaccine studies, that had involved a second dose being given after three weeks.\nThe UK has adopted a policy of delaying the second jab of both vaccines by three months, which had led some to question whether the approach would give sufficient immunity.\nThe trials of the AstraZeneca looked at a longer dosing interval so there was more confidence about that vaccine.\nDr Josie Murray, of Public Health Scotland, said the findings were \"brilliant news\" and suggested the vaccine programme was working."

      "text": "Artist Edvard Munch wrote mysterious graffiti on his painting of The Scream, infrared scans have shown.\nA small and barely visible sentence written on one of the world's most well-known paintings has been the cause of much conjecture in the art world.\nThe words, \"Can only have been painted by a madman\", are inscribed in pencil in the top left-hand corner.\nNow, new tests made by The National Museum of Norway have confirmed they were made by the man himself.\nThe original painting, first displayed in Munch's home city Oslo (then Kristiania) in 1893, has become a radical and timeless expression of human anxiety. Its influence stretches as far as the 90s Hollywood Scream horror film series, and on to the modern-day emoji.\nThe artwork has undergone conservation in preparation for its installation in the new museum, which is due to open in the Norwegian capital next year.\nArt critics have long questioned whether the graffiti was an act of vandalism done by an outraged spectator, or written by Munch himself - who was known to have had mental health problems throughout his life.\nThe museum came to the conclusion the words were written by Munch, after using technology to analyse the handwriting and compare it with his own diaries and letters.\n\"The writing is without a doubt Munch's own,\" said museum curator Mai Britt Guleng.\n\"The handwriting itself, as well as events that happened in 1895, when Munch showed the painting in Norway for the first time, all point in the same direction.\"\nIn 1994, The Scream was stolen from a Norwegian art museum. It was recovered in a daring undercover operation by British detectives.\nThe work provoked strong criticism at the time along with public speculation around Munch's mental state.\nMunch, according to his diaries, was profoundly hurt by the reaction and it's believed he returned to the painting to add his pencilled statement afterwards.\nBoth Munch's father and sister suffered bouts of depression and Munch was finally hospitalised after a nervous breakdown in 1908.\nHis mother and older sister both died before the artist turned 14, his father died 12 years later and another sister was admitted to an asylum, with bipolar disorder.\n\"For as long as I can remember I have suffered from a deep feeling of anxiety which I have tried to express in my art,\" Munch wrote. \n\"Without this anxiety and illness I would have been like a ship without a rudder.\"\nIn 2019, BBC Arts wrote that the work was \"an expression of his anxiety at a turning point in history, in a world increasingly cut loose from old traditions,\" noting that \"there are clear parallels in the world of today.\n\"This is surely why The Scream retains its power despite its ubiquity: it's a mirror of our own contemporary fears. Inside, aren't we all screaming too?\"\nThe Scream will be displayed with a number of Munch's other works, including Madonna, The Dance of Life and Self-Portrait with Cigarette, in The National Museum of Norway from 2022.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "With children in England back in the classroom, teachers face the massive task of making up for months of missed learning.\nA \u00a3720m package has been announced to help pupils in England catch up - although teachers' unions say more is needed. \nHere are some of the measures which could be used to help pupils.\nThe government has asked schools to consider offering face-to-face learning over the summer holidays this year.\nIt is to provide \u00a3200m to secondary schools to fund summer classes for pupils who need it most, especially those children moving up to Year 7.\nSummer schools with qualified teachers leading small groups can help children make up to four months of academic progress, according to the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). \nThey need a strong academic element, chief executive Becky Francis says, although sporting and other fun activities can also contribute to children's emotional wellbeing.\nShe adds: \"Staffing summer schools will be a challenge because of burnout among teachers.\"\nThe government's education catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, has said that the idea of summer schools has \"promise\".\nAnd Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was \"willing to discuss all possibilities\" for keeping schools open over the summer. \nHowever, evidence suggests that disadvantaged pupils, who would benefit the most, are less likely to take up the offer.\nTwo summer school trials run by the EEF saw less than 50% attendance among students in the target group.\nOne-to-one tuition is seen as a proven method of helping children catch up. \nWeekly sessions could help a student make three to six months of academic progress, with particularly large gains in literacy and numeracy among primary-school pupils, according to four recent UK studies.\nThe government is pledging money to an expanded National Tutoring Programme (NTP) for primary and secondary pupils, and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds. \nMore than 100,000 disadvantaged pupils have accessed the service since it began, in November.\nBut the NTP has largely offered online tuition since January, and many of the tutors are university students. \nProf Lee Elliott Major, from the University of Exeter, who first proposed the scheme, early last year, says: \"The evidence is thin about tutoring done online not by professionals.\n\"So the exact impact of the NTP is unclear at the moment.\"\nThe practice of retaking a whole year is common in some countries, such as Germany and the US, but rare in the UK.\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank has suggested it could help pupils whose education has fallen behind.\nBut the Association of School and College Leaders says the idea would be practical for a small number of students only.\nLarge-scale repetition would create \"a log-jam in the system\" and have huge knock-on effects on funding for universities.\nThe EEF estimates it would cost \u00a36,000 per pupil per year in England.\nAnd pupils who repeat a year make an average of four months' less academic progress than those at a similar level who continue on to the next school year, research suggests.\nDisadvantaged pupils can benefit from longer school days, US research suggests.\nAnd Robert Halfon, who chairs the Education Select Committee, told BBC News he had suggested the idea as \"a serious solution for the government to consider\" in England. \nThe extra teaching time could be provided by \"civil society instead of teachers\", he says. \nAfter-school clubs cost about \u00a37 a session, the EEF estimates.\nBut adding two extra weeks of school time a year would cost \u00a3260 per primary pupil and \u00a3360 per secondary pupil. \nThere have been calls for extra funding for mental health support for schoolchildren, to help ease their return to the classroom and improve their chances of catching up.\nTeaching staff trained to improve emotional wellbeing can help pupils make substantial attainment progress, EEF research suggests.\nAnd the EPI has proposed \u00a3650m of extra funding for additional school staff and in-school counselling programmes in England.\n\"Remedial wellbeing work will be necessary to achieve [academic] catch-up,\" it says, particularly for disadvantaged pupils."

      "text": "Scotland's youngest pupils are returning to the classroom for the first time since the Christmas break.\nIt is stage one in a phased reopening of schools which have been closed to all but a minority of pupils since the beginning of January. \nEducation Secretary John Swinney insisted \"detailed clinical analysis\" assured him it is safe. \nBut concerns have been raised about the measures in place to reduce risk of transmission.\nMr Swinney told BBC's Good Morning Scotland that case prevalence data would be closely monitored to determine the impact of the phase one return.\nBut he said Scotland would not be following England, where all pupils are due to return to school on 8 March.\nAsked if it would be \"dangerous\" to send everyone back on that date, Mr Swinney said: \"I wouldn't have clinical authorisation to do that.\"\nThe deputy first minister added: \"We will move as quickly as we possibly can do but we have to do it within the scientific and clinical advice that is available to us.\"\nMr Swinney also urged parents to act responsibly during the first phase of lockdown easing.\nHe added: \"The biggest threat to the opening of schools is not outbreaks in schools. It is community transmission.\"\nEpidemiologist Dr Deepti Gurdasani told BBC Scotland at the weekend there was some evidence from England that younger children could bring infections back into homes. \nBut Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, said the return of schools was about balancing the \"risks and benefits\".\nShe told BBC Good Morning Scotland: \"There will likely be cases emerging in schools over the next few weeks but the vast majority of schools should be fine, and that we have to keep perspective on.\"\nShe said the majority of scientific evidence was that there is an \"age gradient\" in infections - with very few outbreaks in nurseries but with teenagers and university students much more prone to infection. \nProf Sridhar added: \"I think what we have to do is work back up through that gradient. We are doing that starting with primaries and early years - the approach Denmark has also taken.\" \nOn Sunday the deputy first minister pointed to documents prepared by a government expert advisory group which states that younger children are less likely to catch or pass on the virus than older children and adults. \nAre you a parent or a teacher?

You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nPlans to reopen schools have been welcomed by opposition parties but the Scottish Conservatives have urged the government to publish plans for helping pupils catch-up with schooling they have missed. \nAs well as the youngest children returning to school, a small number of senior secondary pupils will be allowed into school buildings on a part-time basis to complete work for national qualifications. \nOther age groups will continue to learn from home and it is unlikely they will return to the classroom before 15 March at the earliest. \nIn primary schools measures to minimise the spread of the virus include regular hand-washing, open windows, and 2m physical distancing between adults, and between adults and children. \nStaff will also be offered regular lateral flow tests. \nResources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown.\nProf Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, has written to parents asking them to play their part in the safe return.\nHe urged them to: \nAppealing to parents not to relax the rules elsewhere, he reminded them that indoor play dates are not allowed  - though children can play together outside. \nAnd he said parents should continue to work from home if they are able to do so. \nMr Swinney's safety assurance came after an epidemiology expert raised concerns about the knock-on effects of sending children back to school. \nDr Deepti Gurdasani, of Queen Mary University of London, said data from England showed primary school children were two times more likely to be the first Covid case in a household, and once infected were two times more likely to infect their contacts. \nSpeaking to BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, she said children aged six and above should wear masks in schools and more attention should be paid to ventilation. \nThe EIS teaching union has also raised concerns about school safety and have said a blended learning model - with about half of pupils in classes at any one time - would be more appropriate.

      "text": "An activist who has been leading a protest against the HS2 railway project from inside a network of central London tunnels has been removed by bailiffs.\nGeography lecturer Larch Maxey had spent almost a month in the tunnels near Euston station, which are thought to be 100ft (30m) long.\nHe is the fifth protester to be removed from the tunnels, while another four are thought to remain underground.\nHS2 Ltd said it was likely Dr Maxey would face criminal charges.\nThe tunnels, which were discovered on 26 January, were dug in secret by HS2 Rebellion protesters to thwart their eviction from their Euston Square Gardens camp, which was set up in September in protest against the \u00a3106bn scheme.\nHS2 Ltd has always maintained it has \"legal possession\" of the land and has constantly urged protesters to leave \"for their own safety\" before they are removed by High Court enforcement officers.\nDr Maxey said in a video that his belongings were confiscated by bailiffs on Monday and although he \"feels fine\", medics had persuaded him to go to hospital to \"be on the safe side\".\nThe 48-year-old added: \"I've basically met my match, they've come for me and they've rinsed me completely.\n\"They've got all my stuff, they've got me backed into a corner and at that point I was like 'OK I'm coming out'.\"\nPreviously Scott Breen, Lachlan Sandford, a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl were removed from the tunnel and taken to court.\nAn HS2 spokesman said Dr Maxey was likely to face charges \"for aggravated trespass or other related offences\" as well as penalties for breaching a High Court order issued on 2 February.\nBreaching the order is punishable by a fine, up to two years in prison, or both, the spokesman added.\nHe added: \"We continue to do all we can to end this illegal action safely, and we reiterate our message to those who remain underground to comply with their court orders and exit the tunnel immediately - for their own safety and that of the HS2 staff, agents and emergency service personnel involved in this operation.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Teachers are being advised to wear face masks in some circumstances as schools prepare to welcome back children aged three to seven.\nOn 22 February, the foundation phase will join children classed as vulnerable and those of critical or key workers who have have been able to remain in school during lockdown.\nWhile some schools in areas with higher rates of Covid-19 infection will delay reopening, it will mean the \"nightmare\" of juggling working from home and home-schooling will end for many.\nBut some parents might be anxious about what sort of learning environment awaits their children.\nThe Welsh Government has published new safety guidance for schools ahead of the return.\nFrom school cleaning to uniforms, transport and lunches - here is everything you need to know about children's' return to school.\nAbsence will not be penalised during this period, the guidance says. \nIt adds is a parent or carer wishes for their child to be absent \"we expect schools to authorise the absence during this time\".\nIt says schools should continue to record attendance in the register and follow up on absences where learners are expected in school.\nYes. The Welsh Government says face masks should be worn by staff if social distancing cannot be maintained - it has acknowledged young children \"will not be able to maintain social distancing\".\nIt says both staff and secondary school learners should wear face masks anywhere on the school estate, including in the classroom.\nThe exception is at mealtimes and when they are outside, unless the school risk assessment indicates that additional measures are needed.\nSchools should ensure adequate waste bins on premises for those who choose to use single-use face coverings.\nVisitors to the school should also use a face covering, including parents and carers when dropping off and picking up.\nPeople need to wash their hands both before and after putting on and removing face coverings.\nNo. The Welsh Government says it recognises younger children \"will not be able to maintain social distancing\", adding it is \"acceptable for them not to distance within their group\". \nStaff need to maintain social distance from other staff and also from learners \"as much as possible, recognising this may not be possible with younger learners\".\nThe guidance says if possible, staff responsible for younger learners should remain with set groups rather than interchange between different groups.\nWhere children undertake desk-based learning, classrooms should have forward-facing desks, one metre apart, the guidance says.\nThe guidance recognises \"this may not be possible or appropriate in all schools and settings and particularly for younger learners\".\nSchools have been told to make the most of the space available, including outdoor space\nSchools have been told to ensure enhanced cleaning takes place, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products such as detergents and disinfectants.\nWhere possible, schools should provide separate toilets for different contact groups. \nWhere this is not possible, hand sanitiser should be used before entering the toilet.\nThe guidance advises grouping learners together in \"as small a group as possible\". \n\"For example, for those learners in the foundation phase this is likely to be the size of the class,\" it adds.\nIt says mixing between separate contact groups, including during arrival at school, break/lunch times and leaving school, should be avoided. \nWhere possible, schools need to ensure appropriate ventilation, the guidance says. \nMechanical ventilation systems should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever possible.\nWindows should be opened - in cooler weather windows should be opened \"just enough to provide constant background ventilation\" and opened more fully during breaks.\nIt says opening internal doors can also assist with increasing air circulation.\nThe guidance says hands should be cleaned thoroughly more often than usual with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use a hand sanitiser if soap and water are unavailable.\nIt says small children and those with complex needs should continue to be helped to clean their hands properly.\nAutomated soap dispensers should be used where possible and hands should preferably be dried using paper towels. \nHand dryers should be avoided where possible.\nThe guidance says some schools \"may feel it is appropriate\" to relax their uniform policy during this period.\nIt points out that school uniform and general clothing shops are currently closed under the Wales-wide alert level four lockdown. \n\"This is a decision for school leaders,\" it adds. \nGloves, aprons and a fluid-resistant surgical mask should be worn if a child becomes unwell with Covid symptoms and needs direct personal care, the guidance says. \nEye protection should also be worn if a risk assessment determines there is a risk of splashing to the eyes such as from coughing, spitting, or vomiting.\nGloves and aprons should also be used when cleaning the areas where a person suspected of having the virus has been.\nGloves and aprons should continue to be used when providing personal care to a child or young person, it says. This can include personal, hands-on care such as washing, toileting, or first aid and certain clinical procedures such as assisted feeding.\nThis depends on whether catering facilities are still available within the school in question. \nIf catering facilities are open, those eligible for free school meals will be provided with lunch on each day they attend. Other learners will still be expected to pay for their meals. \nIf  the school's catering facilities are closed, those eligible for free school meals will be provided with vouchers, food parcels or payments. All learners can be required to bring in a packed lunch. \nLocal authorities remain under a statutory duty to provide free home to school transport for all eligible learners of compulsory school age who live over 2 miles from their primary, or three miles from their secondary school.\nRisk assessments must be completed and signed off by the appropriate local authority officer.\nThere is no requirement to wear a face covering on dedicated home-to-school transport.\nThere is no requirement to maintain contact groups on school transport providing a consistent group of learners travel on the same bus each day they attend."

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Myanmar in one of the largest demonstrations yet against the country's military coup.\nBusinesses closed as employees joined a general strike, despite a military statement that said protesters were risking their lives by turning out.\nThe statement prompted fears the protests could turn violent, but they remained peaceful throughout Monday.\nMyanmar has seen weeks of protest following the coup on 1 February.\nMilitary leaders overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government and have placed her under house arrest, charging her with possessing illegal walkie-talkies and violating the country's Natural Disaster Law.\nProtesters are demanding an end to the military's rule and want Ms San Suu Kyi released, along with senior members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. \n\"We don't want the junta, we want democracy. We want to create our own future,\" one protester, Htet Htet Hlaing, told the Reuters news agency in Yangon.\nA statement from the military carried on state-run broadcaster MRTV said that protesters were \"now inciting the people, especially emotional teenagers and youths, to a confrontation path where they will suffer the loss of life\".\nIt cautioned people against \"riot and anarchy\". The warning prompted Facebook to remove the broadcaster's pages for violating its \"violence and incitement\" policies. \nIt comes after at least two people were killed in protests on Saturday - the worst violence yet in more than two weeks of demonstrations. \nForeign pressure on military leaders has also been high. In a speech on Monday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called for Ms Suu Kyi's release. \nDemonstrations have been taking place in all of Myanmar's main cities, with people waving flags and chanting. \nTens of thousands of people rallied in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and more than 100 people were reportedly arrested in the city.\nBut the mass strike also prompted action in smaller towns and more rural parts of the country. There were large protests in Mandalay, Myitkyina and the coastal town of Dawei.\nThe day of action has been nicknamed the \"22222 Revolution\" because it is taking place on 22 February. It is being compared by protesters to demonstrations on 8 Aug 1988 - known as the 8888 uprising - when Myanmar saw one of its most violent protests.\nThe military cracked down on anti-government demonstrations, killing hundreds of protesters. For many, the date is seen as a watershed moment in Myanmar.\n\"Everyone is joining this,\" protester San San Maw told Reuters in Yangon. \"We need to come out.\"\n\"We came out today to join in the protest, to fight until we win,\" another told AFP. \"We are worried about the crackdown, but we will move forward. We are so angry.\"\nThompson Chau, editor of local media outlet Frontier, told the BBC's World Service that the protests seemed \"a lot bigger than before, with more roads blocked, highways blocked and shops closed everywhere we go\".\n\"Today is more of a huge strike in a sense that everyone is not going to work. All the shops are closed.\"\nMr Chau added that even those working for \"official state companies\" as well as \"government doctors [and] engineers\" were going on strike. \nThere have not been reports of widespread violence, despite the stern warnings delivered by the military on state media. \nImages on social media appeared to show some protesters forming the shape of 22222, while others waved signs and banners bearing the number.\nAs the protests grew on Monday, international pressure mounted on Myanmar's generals to hand back power to the ousted government.\n\"I call on the Myanmar military to stop the repression immediately,\" United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in his annual address to the UN Human Rights Council.\n\"Release the prisoners. End the violence. Respect human rights, and the will of the people expressed in recent elections,\" he said, before insisting that \"coups have no place in our modern world\".\nMyanmar's foreign ministry accused the UN and foreign governments of \"flagrant interference\" in its internal affairs.\nThe US, Canada and the UK have all imposed sanctions on the leaders of the coup.\nAnd on Monday, the European Union said it was ready to impose its own sanctions on Myanmar's top generals.\n\"The EU stands ready to adopt restrictive measures targeting those directly responsible for the military coup and their economic interests,\" the bloc's foreign ministers said in a joint statement.\nThey also called for \"a de-escalation of the current crisis through... the restoration of the legitimate civilian government and the opening of the newly elected parliament\"."

      "tags": "Pimlico,Metropolitan Police Service,MI6",
      "text": "The death of an MI6 agent whose naked body was found inside a locked holdall at his London flat is to be reviewed.\nMetropolitan Police investigators said new information about Gareth Williams, who died in 2010, had come to light.\nThe body of Mr Williams, from Anglesey, was discovered at his Pimlico flat, and a coroner later concluded he was unlawfully killed. \nA year later, in 2013, the Met concluded the 31-year-old had died as a result of an accident.\nAt the 2012 inquest into Mr Williams' death, coroner Fiona Wilcox reached her conclusion based \"on the balance of probabilities\".\n\"[However] most of the fundamental questions in relation to how Gareth died remain unanswered,\" she said. \nThe Sunday Times has now reported a scientist believes DNA profiling advances meant it may now be possible to get fresh information from a single hair found at the flat where Mr Williams was discovered dead, on August 23, 2010.\n\"There is an established review process for investigations whereby new information and/or forensic opportunities are considered,\" a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.\n\"At this stage no forensic review has been commissioned.\n\"However, the MPS is reviewing this new information and will assess whether there are any new investigative opportunities in this case.\"\nIn 2013, Mr Williams' family said they stood by the coroner's findings.\n\"We are naturally disappointed that it is still not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief,\" they said, in a statement at the time.\n\"We consider that on the basis of the facts at present known, the coroner's verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of Gareth's death.\"\nLater that year the Met concluded a three-year investigation into Mr Williams' death.\nAt that time, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said he was satisfied it was \"theoretically possible\" Mr Williams could have padlocked the bag from the inside, although \"many questions remain unanswered\" as to the circumstances of his death.\nBut he said there was no evidence the MI6 officer had intended to take his own life or his death was connected to his work.\nThere were 10 to 15 DNA traces in the flat from which it was not possible to gain full profiles, but all other DNA profiles and fingerprints had been eliminated, said DAC Hewitt.\nHe acknowledged the coroner, having studied \"all the evidence available at that stage\", had made \"the logical inference that it was more likely someone else was involved in Gareth's death\".\n\"At the end of our investigation, based on the evidence, or where we have been unable to find positive evidence, we believe that it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died,\" Mr Hewitt said.\n\"But the reality is that for both hypotheses, there exist evidential contradictions and gaps in our understanding.\"\nHamish Campbell, the detective who led the initial inquiry, told the Sunday Times he suspects Mr Williams' death was linked to his private life and not connected to his work."
