      "tags": "Policing,Black Lives Matter,Kentucky,Breonna Taylor death,Books,US police killings,Publishing,United States",
      "text": "A US publisher says it will not distribute a book by a police officer involved in the fatal shooting of black woman Breonna Taylor.\nJonathan Mattingly, who was shot in the leg during a raid on Ms Taylor's home last year, is writing a book telling his version of what happened. \nHer killing spurred Black Lives Matter protests across the US.\nAfter an online backlash, Simon & Schuster said it would not distribute the book on behalf of its publisher.\nMr Mattingly's book, The Fight for Truth: The Inside Story Behind the Breonna Taylor Tragedy, will be released by independent publisher Post Hill Press, it was reported on Thursday. The publisher releases conservative political books, among other genres.  \nMore than 20,000 people signed a petition calling on Simon & Schuster, which has a deal to distribute Post Hill Press's books, to cancel arrangements to distribute the title.\nLater on Thursday, Simon & Schuster said it would \"not be involved\".\n\"Like much of the American public, earlier today Simon & Schuster learned of plans by distribution client Post Hill Press to publish a book by Jonathan Mattingly,\" the publisher said on Twitter. \"We have subsequently decided not be involved in the distribution of this book.\"\nPost Hill Press said it would press on with the work. \n\"His [Mattingly's] story is important and it deserves to be heard by the public at large. We feel strongly that an open dialogue is essential to shining a light on the challenging issues our country is facing,\" a spokesperson said in a statement provided to the Associated Press. \nNews of Mr Mattingly's book generated fierce criticism, with author Roxane Gay among those condemning the move. \nKentucky State representative Attica Scott, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that \"people love to profit off of Black pain and tragedy. It sells.\"\nMr Mattingly, 48, was one of three plainclothes officers who conducted a raid on Ms Taylor's home in Louisville, Kentucky, on 13 March 2020. Police had a warrant to search for drugs but none were found. \nWhen they entered the apartment, Mr Mattingly was shot in the leg by Ms Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who said he fired a single shot after fearing an intruder was breaking into the apartment.\nThe officers returned fire, killing Ms Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician. Mr Mattingly fired at least one of the shots that hit Ms Taylor, but not the one that killed her, a FBI report said.\nMs Taylor's name became a global rallying cry as people demanded a thorough investigation into her death.\nIn September, a grand jury cleared Mr Mattingly and the other officers of murder charges.\nMr Mattingly, who still serves as a police officer, has previously said the case had \"nothing to do with race\".\nLast year, he accused city officials of failing \"all of us in epic proportions for their own gain and to cover their asses\".\nIn October, the officer sued Mr Walker for assault and battery. His lawyer accused Ms Taylor's boyfriend of causing \"severe trauma, mental anguish, and emotional distress,\" when he shot Mr Mattingly."

      "tags": "Companies,Ocado,Driverless cars,Retailing",
      "text": "Online grocery retailer Ocado has unveiled a major push into autonomous driving technology.\nIt has teamed up with another British company, Oxbotica, to build self-driving vehicles for itself and others who use its platform.\nThat could include automatic forklift trucks at warehouses, self-driving delivery vans, or even \"kerb to kitchen\" robots for the final leg.\nAs part of the deal, Ocado has bought a \u00a310m stake in Oxbotica.\nTogether, they say they plan to build hardware and software for autonomous vehicles. \n\"We want the entire end to end operation, ultimately, to be autonomous - from the receipt of stock to the warehouse all the way through to the customer's door,\" said Alex Harvey, Ocado's head of advanced technology.\n\"From a customer's perspective you open your door and outside you will see an autonomous van or another autonomous vehicle pull up outside your house, and most likely an autonomous robot will get out of that autonomous vehicle, will collect your groceries, and hand them to you at the doorstep.\" \nIn recent years, Ocado has tried to project itself as a technology platform to be used by global retailers, rather than just an online grocery store. \nIt has developed robots which now pick and pack groceries at its state-of-the-art fulfilment centres, and this week, America's Kroger supermarket chain unveiled its first warehouse using the Ocado technology.\nKroger's delivery vans also use software developed by Ocado to plot the most efficient routes. \nThe new partnership with Oxbotica will aim to take this idea further. \nOxbotica builds autonomous driving software for a range of global clients. The company was founded in 2014 by two Oxford professors - Paul Newman and Ingmar Posner - whose university research focused on self-driving cars.\nThe startup company has just raised new funding from investors in the UK, US and China. Ocado's \u00a310m stake is part of that funding round, and will give it a seat on Oxbotica's board.\nIn its announcement, Ocado tempered expectations and said that getting permission from regulators to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads - allowing driverless deliveries to customers' homes - may take some time.\nBut it said that \"last-mile\" deliveries to customers' homes are a significant part of an online retailer's costs, with labour accounting for half of that - so autonomous vans could produce big savings.\nIn the short term, it sees vehicles operating in restricted areas such as its own warehouses, with the first prototypes coming within two years.\nOcado executives hate it when you call it an online grocer. The company wants to be seen as a technology platform for the world's retailers. This partnership with another British business, the scrappy autonomous software startup Oxbotica, is meant to signal the scale of its ambitions.\nFor Oxbotica's Paul Newman, it's an exciting opportunity for two UK companies to become a global force in technology which has been dominated by American and Chinese players - \"we've got a global vision, we're going to change the way goods are moved,\" he told me this morning.\nAnd Ocado's technology boss Alex Harvey points out that the company has already acquired two American tech businesses this year.\n\"It's normally the other way around... I think it represents a very exciting opportunity to be able to leverage the best of British between Oxbotica and Ocado and export it to the rest of the world.\"\nRemember - big dreams about the progress towards self-driving vehicles on public roads have come up against the reality that the technological and regulatory hurdles to be cleared are very challenging, \nEveryone from the former Chancellor Philip Hammond to Oxbotica's own Paul Newman predicted self-driving cars and vans should be on UK streets by now.\nProf Newman, who started his driverless car research as an Oxford University academic, admits that was a little optimistic. But he says now, the time is right: \"This is a sensible proposition that makes economic sense.\"\nBut sceptics will wonder how motorists will feel about sharing the roads with driverless vans, let alone what customers will think about a robot telling you that the avocados are out of stock and you're getting oranges instead."

      "title": "Covid: How ready is Scotland to unlock?",
      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will be a much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. As Scotland prepares to unlock, here are five things about the state of the epidemic. \nThe emergence of the Kent Covid variant in the weeks before Christmas drove a massive spike in cases in Scotland.\nAt the beginning of the year, the number of weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland almost reached 300, triggering a full lockdown which has now lasted almost four months.\nBut there has been a sustained decline in weekly cases since January, with the rate falling to below 35 on 13 April.\nUsing a World Health Organization (WHO) system for measuring infection levels, this indicates Scotland has a \"moderate\" level of community transmission of the virus.\nThe rate is now the lowest it has been since September and still appears to be falling.\nScotland's death rate also spiked in January after the Kent variant spread rapidly among the population.\nIt is believed that the variant can lead to a higher chance of hospitalisation and death, as well as being much more infectious.\nTowards the end of January the number of weekly Covid deaths per 100,000 people within 28 days of a positive test went higher than eight.\nThis figure went below 1.0 on 14 March and by 12 April it had fallen to 0.1.\nThe Scottish government says this sustained decline in the death rate has been achieved through a combination of people sticking to lockdown rules, and the vaccination of those most vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19.\nAccording to the WHO's thresholds, the death rate in Scotland indicates \"low\" levels of community transmission.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nBy this measure the 14-day average on 12 April was 1.9% - just below the WHO's 2% threshold indicating a \"low\" level of community transmission.\nIt's worth pointing out that the WHO's preferred way of measuring the positivity rate is through \"sentinel surveillance\", or random community testing, which is not how the Scottish government reports it in its daily figures.\nHowever, the organisation lists \"overall test positivity\" as an additional measure if a comprehensive testing system is in place.\nIt's expected that all of Scotland will harmonise at level three from 26 April.\nRates in all local authorities have fallen in the last couple of months, but there are still significant differences between areas.\nThere have been very few cases recently in Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles or in Dumfries and Galloway, contrasting with much higher rates in Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire and West Lothian.\nThis variation in rates is one the Scottish government will continue to watch carefully, as public health officials try to avoid importing cases from areas of high levels of the virus to communities with low levels. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that there may still be a need in future for some \"limited travel restrictions\" within Scotland to prevent this happening.\nOn 9 April, there were 10 local authorities with a higher level of cases than the Scotland-wide rate - and six are still categorised as having \"high\" levels of community transmission according to the WHO.\nThe WHO outlines five \"situational levels\" ranging from level zero, when there should be \"no restrictions\" on daily activities, up to level four which requires a full lockdown to tackle an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nUsing measures like the death rate and the percentage of positive cases, the WHO system indicates that Scotland is currently sitting in level one or two, which is when more stringent rules like travel restrictions can be lifted.\nIn other words, Scotland does appear ready to come out of a full lockdown.\nThe WHO says that in level two some additional measures may be required to control transmission, however, \"disruptions to social and economic activities can still be limited\".\nIn level one, \"basic measures\" should remain in place to prevent Covid infections spreading, but any disruptions to social and economic life should be \"limited and transient\".\nBut there is an important caveat to the WHO document, which possibly casts an even more optimistic light on Scotland's situation - it was written in November and so does not take into account a country's vaccination programme.\nAbout 60% of people aged 16 or over in Scotland have now received at least a first dose of a Covid vaccine, with hopes that the programme will be complete by the end of July.\nIn recent weeks there has been a focus on administering second doses of the vaccine, with more than 600,000 people in Scotland now fully vaccinated.\nThe Scottish government also says that everyone in the nine priority groups, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has now been offered a vaccine, with almost all the over-50s having received a first dose."

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Hong Kong anti-government protests,China,Hong Kong",
      "text": "The billionaire media mogul Jimmy Lai is one of the most prominent supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. He has been a persistent thorn in China's side, and is now in prison serving a year's sentence for his involvement in protests in the territory. \nMr Lai was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China, arriving in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat. Like a number of the city\u2019s famed tycoons, he went from a menial role, toiling in a Hong Kong sweatshop, to founding a multi-million dollar empire. \nBut unlike others who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai also became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory. As a result, he has faced a string of cases in recent years and was eventually been sentenced to a prison term on a charge of \"unauthorised assembly\".\nHe is still the most prominent person charged under Hong Kong's controversial new national security law, which can carry a life sentence.\n\u201cI\u2019m a born rebel,\" he told the BBC in an interview late last year, hours before he was charged. \"I have a very rebellious character.\"\nJimmy Lai was born in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, to a wealthy family that lost everything when the communists took power in 1949. From working odd jobs and knitting in a small clothing shop he taught himself English, eventually founding the international clothing brand Giordano.\nThe chain was a huge success. But when in 1989 China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, Mr Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur.\nHe started writing columns criticising the massacre that followed the demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went on to become one of Hong Kong's most influential.\nAs China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Mr Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that now include Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper.\nIn a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Mr Lai has been a persistent critic of China's authorities both through his publications and writing. This has seen him become a hero for many residents in Hong Kong but on the mainland he is viewed as a \u201ctraitor\u201d who threatens Chinese national security.\nIn recent years, masked attackers have firebombed Mr Lai\u2019s house and company headquarters. The 73-year-old has also been the target of an assassination plot.\nBut none of the threats has stopped him from airing his views robustly. He has been a prominent part of the city\u2019s pro-democracy demonstrations and had already been arrested twice this year on illegal assembly charges for earlier protests before his detention earlier this month. \nWhen China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June, Mr Lai told the BBC it spelt the \"death knell\" for the territory. The influential entrepreneur also warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as China. Without the rule of law, he said, its coveted status as a global financial hub would be \"totally destroyed\".\nFor his admirers Mr Lai is a man of courage who has taken on great risks to defend the freedoms of Hong Kong.\n\"I have enormous respect for Mr. Lai. Clearly a man with courage and probably among the very very few who has maintained his business interests without diluting his principles,\" wrote one Twitter user after his arrest.\nThe media mogul is known for his frankness and acts of flamboyance. Earlier this year he had urged US President Donald Trump to help the territory, saying he was \"the only one who can save us\" from China. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: \"Mr President, please help us.\"\nWhen his sentence was read out in court in April, he was calm. The judge said, \"Actions have consequences for everyone irrespective of who they are.\" Outside the courtroom, pro-democracy protesters chanted. "

      "text": "Successful vaccine programmes will prevent another washout for summer holidaymakers, the boss of Europe's largest tour company has told the BBC.\n\"We are optimistic about the summer,\" said Friedrich Joussen, who runs TUI.\nThe firm - which owns a fleet of aircraft, cruise ships and a chain of travel agencies - said bookings in March alone had hit 2.8 million.\nAs a result, it expected to operate up to 75% of its normal schedule for the summer season. \n\"We are still confident that we will have a decent summer,\" said Mr Joussen, pointing to coronavirus vaccination programmes in the UK, US and Europe.\nThe company, which sells holidays to 180 different countries, suffered heavy losses during the pandemic.\nAcross the industry, income slumped by almost $4.5 trillion last year, leaving more than 62 million people without work, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\nThe industry body is pressing for international travel to resume in June to stem further job losses.\nBut Mr Joussen said he expected some countries to ask travellers to prove they had been vaccinated before they were allowed to cross the border. Although he thinks demonstrating a negative test result would be just as effective in preventing the spread of the virus.\nHowever, for that strategy to be successful, he said the cost of those tests should be reduced.\n\"The cheaper it gets, the better it works and the less harmful it is for the general economy,\" he said.\nEuropean countries have ramped up their vaccination programmes in recent weeks, as the continent experiences a third wave of infections in the face of new variants. Nevertheless, Mr Joussen is optimistic about the summer.\n\"All medical advice we are getting as a company says that existing vaccines are working with existing variants,\" Mr Joussen said.\n\"Now they might be less efficient sometimes, but still it's much better than not being vaccinated.\"\nIn the past year, TUI has been forced to borrow billions from the German government just to stay afloat. But analysts have warned that in the wake of the crisis, the part-nationalised firm may struggle to compete against leaner rivals, as the industry reels from more than 12 months of international travel bans.\nMr Joussen said the German state stepped in at a time of great uncertainty, when the firm was struggling to survive and could not raise money from private investors. \n\"Berlin is a very rational investor,\" he said, adding: \"Germany would want to exit the loan as soon as possible.\"\nYou can watch Friedrich Joussen's  full interview on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT, Monday 06: 30 GMT & 10:30 GMT, Tuesday at 12:30 GMT and Thursday at 07:30 GMT."

      "tags": "David Cameron,Eric Pickles,Greensill Capital,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying",
      "text": "A former head of the Civil Service has said he is \"baffled\" that approval was given for a top civil servant to take a job at Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll. \nLord Kerslake said he could \"see no circumstances\" under which Bill Crothers's appointment at the finance firm could have been \"acceptable\".\nThe government has ordered a review which will look into his role.\nLabour said the dual working was evidence of a \"return to sleaze\".\nLord Kerslake, who ran the Civil Service under David Cameron's government and has advised the Labour Party, is the latest high-profile figure to express concern about the relationship between political figures and the now collapsed finance firm.\nGreensill is at the heart of a row engulfing Westminster about access, influence and lobbying, after it emerged that Mr Cameron had contacted current cabinet ministers about loans on behalf of the company, while working as a consultant there after leaving office.\nA government review and three separate inquiries by parliamentary committees will look at the former prime minister's role and that of Mr Crothers. \nThe National Audit Office, which monitors public spending, has also launched an investigation in to Greensill's involvement in the government's Covid-19 financial support schemes.\nIt says this will include the accreditation process and any subsequent monitoring of the company's activities.\nMr Crothers had stopped being head of government procurement by the time he started work as an adviser for Greensill in 2015, but remained a senior civil servant.\nLord Kerslake, an independent peer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that trust in the Civil Service was \"its most precious commodity\".\nHe said he was \"shocked and concerned\" at recent revelations, and that \"legitimate concerns\" about how Mr Crothers - who was able to hold dual roles - needed to be \"thoroughly investigated\".\n\"He led on procurement, an area of absolutely intense scrutiny and where integrity is vital,\" he said, while \"the effect of what he did, if not the intent\" was to \"bypass\" the rules set out by the watchdog, Acoba, that advises ministers and officials on outside employment. \n\"The situation was that Greensill were active in government, even if they didn't have a contract. So I am personally baffled as to how this got approved,\" he added. \nMr Crothers's appointment by joined Greensill received the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office, but he did not consult Acoba. \nIt emerged on Thursday that he had also failed to alert it about another job he took in 2016 as a trustee with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply.\nMr Crothers apologised in a letter to Acoba for what he described an \"honest mistake\", saying he did not think he had to report the role as it was unpaid and with a not-for-profit charity.\nBut the head of Acoba, Lord Pickles, said the rules applied to both paid and unpaid jobs and it was therefore a breach of the regulations.\nThe Guardian newspaper has reported further links between Greensill and the Civil Service.\nIt said David Brierwood combined a role as a Crown representative in the Cabinet Office with being a director at Greensill for three-and-a-half years.\nMr Brierwood has not commented on the revelations. \nBut a Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"Crown representatives do not participate in the procurement process nor are they able to award any contracts.\n\"They are part-time senior executives recruited for their working knowledge of a sector to help ensure value for money for the taxpayer.\n\"All Crown representatives go through regular propriety checks and cannot work with a supplier where there could be a conflict of interest.\n\"Mr Brierwood's Crown representative role was not anything to do with supply-chain finance.\"\nSpeaking on a visit to Edinburgh, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his calls for a \"full, independent, transparent inquiry\".\n\"This has gone much wider than a single incident,\" he added, with \"story after story\" of cronyism and \"contracts for mates\". \n\"It is a catalogue of examples of sleaze and we have got to get to the bottom of it.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said the \"most important thing is to get to the bottom of it properly\" and that all ministers and officials have been ordered to tell the government inquiry what it needs to know.

You can only do so much online shopping [people want to] get out and feel the products and brands in real life.\" \nOver its last financial year, for the 12 months to 31 December, Hammerson reported a record \u00a31.7bn loss.\nHowever, even before the coronavirus pandemic forced the closure of large parts of the economy, retailers and their landlords were struggling as more consumers chose to shop online.\nLast June, Intu, the heavily-indebted owned of Manchester's Trafford Centre, was forced to file for administration.\nMr Bourgeois said: \"Retail has always been about winners and losers and that's been really accelerated during Covid.\"\nHe said Hammerson was now working to \"repurpose\" space left by the likes of department store Debenhams, which closed all its high street stores after falling into administration and selling the brand to online fashion firm Boohoo.\n\"We have a planning application in Leicester for instance where we are preparing to demolish a Debenhams store and put 300 flats there,\" said Mr Bourgeois. \"So we're bringing homes right into the heart of the city.\""

      "tags": "Chemistry,Effects of global warming,Materials science",
      "text": "Scientists in the US have developed a paint significantly \"whiter than the whitest paint currently available\". \nTests carried out by researchers at Purdue University on their \"ultra-white\" paint showed it reflected more than 98% of sunlight. \nThat suggests, the scientists say, that it could help save energy and fight climate change. \nPainting \"cool roofs\" white is an energy-saving approach already being rolled out in some major cities.\nCommercially available white paints reflect between 80% and 90% of sunlight, according to lead researcher Prof Xiulin Ruan from Purdue, in West Lafayette, Indiana. \"It's a big deal, because every 1% of reflectance you get translates to 10 watts per metre squared less heat from the Sun,\" he explained. \n\"So if you were to use our paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 sq ft  (93 sq m), we estimate you could get a cooling power of 10 kilowatts. That's more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses,\" he said. \n\"Cool\" white roofs are seen as an easy, urban climate solution. \nIn the US, New York has recently coated more than 10 million sq ft of rooftops white. The state of California has already updated building codes to promote cool roofs. \nTheir benefits are still being investigated, but studies have shown they can reduce energy demands and create lower ambient temperatures. That has the added benefit of reducing the amount of water used for irrigation in cities. \n\"We did a very rough calculation,\" said Prof Ruan. \"And we estimate we would only need to paint 1% of the Earth's surface with this paint - perhaps an area where no people live that is covered in rocks - and that could help fight the climate change trend.\"\nThe new paint contains a compound called barium sulfate, which is also used to make photo paper and cosmetics.\n\"We used a very high concentration of the compound particles,\" explained Prof Ruan. \"And we use lots of different sizes of particles, because sunlight has different colours at the different wavelength.\"\nHow much each particle scatters light depends on its size, \"so we deliberately used different particle sizes to scatter each wavelength\".\nThe researchers are now working with a company to produce and sell their paint, which they say should be similar in cost to currently available paints. \n\"I already had an inquiry from a museum that wants to put up a display of our whitest white paint side by side with the blackest black,\" said Prof Ruan.  \nThat ultra-black coating is a material scientists developed in 2014, called Vantablack. \nIt absorbs almost all light, so its potential uses are almost the opposite of the \"ultra-white\" paint. Vantablack, used in space telescopes, for example, could absorb stray light that might interfere with their ability to measure light from objects in deep space.     \nBut Vantablack, which is a coating of nanoscale carbon tubes, is not available to everyone. Its invention led to an artistic controversy when sculptor and former Turner prize-winning artist, Anish Kapoor, bought the exclusive rights to its \"use as an art material\". \nIn response, UK-based artist Stuart Semple created a pigment that he claimed to be the world's \"pinkest pink\" and made it available to purchase on his website for \"everyone but Anish Kapoor\".\nVantablack's developers, a company called Surrey NanoSystems, said the exclusivity deal with Mr Kapoor would not preclude the whitest white being displayed alongside the blackest black in a museum. \"That isn't art; we would see it as an educational display for people interested in the science and technology behind extremes of light and darkness,\" the company told BBC News. \nProf Ruan added that it would be up to the company that produces the \"ultra-white\" paint, but he hoped it would be available to everyone.\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "tags": "Hong Kong anti-government protests,China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "In its latest move to tighten control over Hong Kong, China is pushing for a controversial \"patriot\" plan to reform the city's elections.\nBeijing says the goal is to keep \"unpatriotic\" figures from positions of political power in Hong Kong. \nBut critics warn it would mean the end of democracy in Hong Kong, eradicating whatever opposition there is left.\nHong Kong used to be under British control, but was handed back to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThis was meant to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong, which no other part of mainland China has: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary, and some democratic rights. \nThese freedoms are enshrined in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was meant to last until 2047.\nOn 11 March, the \"patriots governing Hong Kong\" resolution was passed at the National People's Congress (NPC), paving the way for Beijing to amend annexes of the Basic Law.\nOn 30 March, the resolution passed the NPC's Standing Committee and could be enacted in Hong Kong within weeks. \nCandidates for Hong Kong's parliament, the Legislative Council (LegCo) are to be nominated by the Election Committee, a powerful body which until now only elected the city's most senior official, the Chief Executive. This Election Committee, which is heavily pro-Beijing, will be expanded by 300 members from 1,200 to 1,500. \nAny prospective MP, member of the Election Committee or candidate for Chief Executive will be vetted by a separate screening committee, making it easy to bar anyone deemed as being critical of Beijing. \nThere will also be changes to LegCo itself, diluting the influence of directly elected MPs. \nWhile overall seats will increase from 70 to 90, the number of directly elected representatives will fall from 35 to 20. \nForty seats will go to MPs chosen by the Election Committee while 30 will be given to MPs elected by special interests such as business, banking and trade, which historically are also pro-Beijing.\nThe move appears to be a continuation of China's plan to tighten control over Hong Kong, following recent developments.\nHuge pro-democracy protests took place in 2019, some of which turned violent. Later that year, pro-democracy groups made huge gains in local district council elections.\nSince then, Beijing has passed a controversial national security law, which effectively reduces Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. Dozens of people have since been arrested under this law. \nIn November 2020, several lawmakers were deemed threats to national security and dismissed - this led to the resignation of nearly all the city's pro-democracy lawmakers. \nThe developments underscore the rapid expansion of Beijing's influence in the territory, pushing for loyalty from all levels of power.\nCritics, including the UK government, allege that China is now effectively undermining the \"one country, two systems\" principle with all these changes.\nBut Beijing says it is safeguarding its sovereignty, and rejects what it calls \"foreign interference\" in domestic affairs."

      "text": "Pregnant women should be offered a Covid jab when other people their age get one, the UK's vaccine advisers say.\nThey say the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are preferable because data from the US in 90,000 pregnant women has not raised any safety concerns.\nUp until now, only women with underlying health conditions or those whose risk of exposure to the virus was high were eligible.\nThe shift in advice brings the UK into line with other countries.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation now advises that pregnant women should all be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines where available, at the same time as the rest of the population. \nThey are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccines with their doctor before making the appointment, but it is not a requirement.\n\"There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed,\" it added.\nCurrently, there is a lack of data on the AstraZeneca vaccine in pregnancy because pregnant women were not included in trials, but the JCVI says more evidence may be forthcoming in the near future.\nThe JCVI has already said that, as a precaution, adults under 30 should be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca jab because of evidence possibly linking it to extremely rare blood clots in adults.\nProfessor Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 chair for the JCVI, said: \"We encourage pregnant women to discuss the risks and benefits with their clinician - those at increased risk of severe outcomes from Covid-19 are encouraged to promptly take up the offer of vaccination when offered.\"\nDr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"Vaccination offers pregnant women the best protection from Covid-19, which can be serious in some women. \n\"We believe it should be a woman's choice whether to have the vaccine or not after considering the benefits and risks, and would encourage pregnant women to discuss with a trusted source like their GP, obstetrician or midwife, or a healthcare professional in a vaccination centre.\"\nDr Mary Ross-Davie, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the new advice was \"a sensible step\" by the vaccines committee.\nShe said midwives and obstetricians \"will be there to support pregnant women to make an informed decision that is right for them\". \nWomen can be vaccinated at any time during their pregnancy although they may prefer to wait until after the first trimester or the first scan, the RCOG said.\nAlthough pregnant women are at no greater risk of being infected by the virus, they are more likely to have complications from Covid-19.\nData shows that one in five pregnant women who become unwell with Covid needs to have her baby delivered early.\nAs the UK's vaccination programme is now inviting people in their 40s, clarity on advice for pregnant women on the vaccine was needed.\nMore than 32 million people in the UK have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine.\nWomen who are planning pregnancy or are breastfeeding can be vaccinated with any vaccine, depending on their age and clinical risk group, the JCVI said.\nIt said it would closely monitor the evidence on Covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy and update its advice as required.\nAre you pregnant?

      "title": "Prince Philip: An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life",
      "tags": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him.\nAnd so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company.\nWith his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man.\nHis mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. \nHis four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding.  \nWhen peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the \"white heat of the technological revolution\", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable.\nHe was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, \"the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,\" as his sister Sophia later described it.\nIn Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him.\n\"I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,\" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links.\nBy the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea.\nPhilip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. \nThat ethos became a significant, perhaps the significant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. \"The essence of freedom,\" he would say in Ghana in 1958, \"is discipline and self-control.\" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important \"but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living\". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the \"importance of the individual\" as the \"guiding principle of our society\".\nAnd at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. \nAnd yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last?\nAt Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy.\nThe navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, \"Dickie\" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. \"Prince Philip\", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, \"will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength\".   \nOthers had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  \"If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,\" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. \"One of his crew,\" writes another biographer, \"said he would rather die than serve under him again.\"\nIn Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. \"It is an extraordinary master or mistress,\" he would say later, \"it has such extraordinary moods.\"  But a rival to the sea would come. \nWhen King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip.\nDid he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end.\nHe knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, \"as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him\". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably.\nFor someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. \"There's never been 'if only',\" he said once, \"except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy\". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, \"I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it.\"\nThat moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, \"It takes a man to have a boy.\" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen.\nHe would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her \"liege man of life and limb\". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. \"I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,\" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband.\nPrince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. \"Within the house,\" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, \"I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably.\" \nThe transition to life in the Palace was brutal. \"Philip,\" said his equerry, \"was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers.\" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was \"difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive\". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany.\nIn response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s.\nAt home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. \nWithin the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. \n\"He believes he has a creative mission,\" wrote an early biographer, \"to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society.\"\nHe was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment.\nIn his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a \"splendid gadget\" that he called \"a miniature word processor\".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. \nOut of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. \"A lot of time and energy,\" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, \"has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already.\"\nReflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (\"it seems to me...\") garnered from his extensive travels.\nDespite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of \"urban dwellers\" and of the \"average citizen\" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - \"The enterprise is doomed,\" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, \"if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory.\"\nHe was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the \"greedy and senseless exploitation of nature.\" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, \"a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" which he referred to as the \"greenhouse effect\".\nAnd he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: \"I have very little experience of self-government,\" he told one audience, \"I am one of the most governed people you could meet....\" His example of irrational behaviour? - \"making and listening to speeches on important occasions\". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - \"I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions.\" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. \nIt is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his \"gaffes\", off-colour comments and salty jokes.\nThat he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. \nThere was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did.\nLooking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say \"I don't know why you are bothering\". He once said of his son Charles: \"He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling.\" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. \nAnd the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. \"Life,\" wrote one biographer, \"hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick.\" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. \"What the royal family offers you is friendliness,\" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, \"not friendship.\"  \nMajor General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he \"asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine\".  \nIt was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. \nBecause of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. \"A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,\" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, \"needs a loose fit portrait.\"\nHe was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? \"Absolutely, absolutely,\" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other \"followers\", with trademark modesty. \"Our only distinction,\" he said, \"was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it.\""

      "text": "Chile's Health Minister Enrique Paris has been striking a gloomy note at his daily Covid news conferences in recent days. \nThe number of daily cases reached a new record high on 9 April, going over 9,000 for the first time since the pandemic began and considerably higher than the previous peak of just under 7,000 cases in mid-June.\n\"It's worrying,\" he said last Friday. \"We're going through a critical moment of the pandemic\u2026 I urge you to take care of yourselves, of your loved ones, of your families.\"\nIntensive care units are again overwhelmed, the country has for a second time closed its borders to everyone who is not a resident and most of its 18 million inhabitants are back in lockdown.\n\"It feels like we're going backwards,\" says Santiago resident Sof\u00eda Pinto. \"We need to download special permits online to be allowed out just twice a week for essential things like food shopping or doctor's visits.\"\nThe frustration and confusion many Chileans are feeling over the renewed lockdown is due partly to the fact that just two months ago, President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era was boasting about Chile having one of the fastest vaccination rollouts in the world. \nCritics have accused the Pi\u00f1era government of getting caught up in triumphalism over the vaccine rollout and of having loosened coronavirus restrictions too fast.  \nLike governments across the world, ministers here faced difficult choices. \nChile's borders had been closed - bar for a few exceptions - from March to November 2020. But after a strict lockdown had driven the rolling seven-day average down to 1,300 cases in November, the decision was taken to reopen them, including to international tourists.\nChileans were also given special holiday permits to travel more freely around the country during the southern hemisphere summer holidays after some experts argued it was important for people's mental health. \nRestaurants, shops, and holiday resorts were opened up to kickstart the faltering economy. \nAnd while the vaccination rollout has indeed been fast, it only started in late December, with front-line health care workers, those over 90, and teachers first in line. \nSo the vast majority of Chileans would not yet have been vaccinated by the time they met up with relatives and friends for their summer holidays in January and February. \nAdd to that the spread of new, more easily transmittable variants of the virus such as the P.1 variant, which is thought to have emerged in Brazil's Amazonas state in November. \nDr Susan Bueno, a professor of immunology from the Pontifical Catholic University, says the recent surge is \"a multi-factor issue\", but that she thinks the new variants are having a \"huge impact\".\nShe says the message about how to prevent contagion, such as wearing masks and washing your hands, was also somewhat neglected during the summer months in Chile. That, she explains, \"is probably one of the causes of the outbreaks we are seeing now\".\nThere is also confusion about how the vaccine that the vast majority in the country has received works, Prof Bueno adds. More than 93% of the doses administered in Chile so far have been CoronaVac, produced by the Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac. \nData on the efficacy of the CoronaVac vaccine is varied. Brazilian trials suggested an efficacy rate of around 50.4% but results from late-stage trials in Indonesia and Turkey suggested a much higher rate - between 65% and 83%.\nA study published by the University of Chile last week (in Spanish) looked at the level of protection the vaccine offered after the first and the second doses. \nIt suggested CoronaVac was 56.5% effective in protecting people against infection two weeks after they had received their second dose, but the figure was only 3% in the timespan between the first and second doses.\nThis may give a key clue as to why cases may still be on the rise in Chile, where more than 7.6 million people have received the first jab, but the number of those who have had both the first and second doses is much lower. \nAt a news conference presenting the findings, University of Chile's rector, Ennio Vivaldi, went as far as saying that the first dose of CoronaVac on its own did not have \"any relevant effect\".\nProf Bueno, who is the scientific director of the clinical trial for CoronaVac vaccines in Chile, says complying with the full vaccination schedule is therefore paramount. \"Just one dose doesn't give you the whole preventive response,\" she explains. \nIt is a message that Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez thinks the government has not done enough to get across. The Santiago resident has just received her first jab at a vaccination centre. \n\"Two jabs are needed before the vaccine works properly,\" she says as she waits outside the clinic to make sure she does not have an allergic reaction. \"And even then, we still need to be careful, follow social distancing and other safety measures.\" \nSome Chileans are worried about the efficacy of the CoronaVac. \nGonzalo Sir is one of them. He has come to one of the few vaccination centres in the capital that offers the Pfizer vaccine. \n\"I want that one [the Pfizer vaccine] because I hear it is more effective and I need it because I travel for my work and Pfizer is more widely recognised,\" he says. \nBut Prof Bueno, who analyses scientific data from trials with the CoronaVac, is adamant that the data shows that it works.\nShe says in the trial that showed an efficacy rate of around 50% many of those who got infected only had very mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. She stresses that the important thing is that no-one in the trial needed to go into intensive care. \nShe insists CoronaVac prevents deaths and severe illness and is also proving effective against the Brazilian variant.\nIn response to the spike in cases, the government has not only ordered a strict lockdown but is also providing the latest information about its vaccination campaign on a website inspired by the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.\nAnd as the counter on the website ticks upwards as a growing number of Chileans get vaccinated, the message about the importance of getting vaccinated also seems to be filtering through.\n\"It's vital that we get the vaccine and I don't care which one I get,\" says Ver\u00f3nica Perez, who recently got the CoronaVac. \"All of them help save lives.\" "

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Windsor,Windsor Castle",
      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's four children will walk alongside his coffin at his funeral on Saturday.\nPrinces Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry, will follow a Land Rover hearse in a procession to St George's Chapel, Windsor.\nThe guest list for the service includes 30 people, with three German relatives.\nThose attending will wear morning coats with medals, or day dress, but not military uniform.\nThe congregation will put on masks and socially distance in line with Covid lockdown rules, with the Queen seated alone.\nThe details of Prince Philip's ceremonial royal funeral at the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle at 15:00 BST were released by Buckingham Palace.\nA Palace spokesman said the plans have been modified to take into account current public health guidelines, but the ceremonial aspects of the day and the service remain in line with the duke's wishes.\nHe said the service will be a reflection of Prince Philip's military affiliations and personal elements of his life.\nThe other guests include the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge, all of the duke's grandchildren and their spouses, the children of the Queen's sister Princess Margaret, and Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.\nThe Countess Mountbatten of Burma, previously known as Lady Romsey and later Lady Brabourne, who was Philip's carriage driving partner and one of his closest friends will also be in attendance.\nThe 67-year-old countess is the wife of Earl Mountbatten, Norton Knatchbull - the grandson of Prince Philip's uncle the 1st Earl Mountbatten, who was killed by the IRA in 1979.\nBuckingham Palace said the Queen faced \"some very difficult\" decisions in selecting the guests permitted under Covid rules, from original plans for a 800-strong congregation, adding she wanted all branches of her husband's family to be represented.\nBy Daniela Relph, royal correspondent\nThis is the funeral the Duke of Edinburgh wanted for himself.\nThe guests, the music, the military representation are exactly what the duke requested for his own farewell. The one element he perhaps didn't account for was the family tension.\nThe Queen has decided that there will be no military uniforms worn by members of the Royal Family on Saturday.\nThis neatly avoids the Prince Harry and Prince Andrew problem. Both have stepped back from their military patronages and the issue of them wearing uniform was a dilemma that has now gone away.\nThe order of the funeral procession has revealed that the duke's grandsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, will not walk alongside one another. Instead, their cousin Peter Philips will walk between them.\nBuckingham Palace won't comment on this decision. Responding to questions from reporters, a spokesman said they would not be drawn into discussing \"perceptions of drama\". \nOf the tributes paid to Prince Philip over recent days, Buckingham Palace said the Queen and the family had been touched at the testimony around \"the remarkable life and lasting endeavours of the Duke of Edinburgh\".\nPrince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April aged 99. His body is now resting in the private chapel at the castle.\nOn the day of the funeral, the coffin will be moved to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle. It will be placed on the modified Jaguar Land Rover, that the duke himself helped design, to be carried the short distance to St George's Chapel.\nThe procession to the chapel will be headed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, followed by the the Major General's party and military service chiefs.\nMembers of the Royal Family will walk behind the coffin. Princess Anne and Prince Charles will walk in the front row, followed by Prince Edward and Prince Andrew. \nIn the third row, the Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex will be either side of their cousin Peter Philips. \nVice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon will be in the next row, trailed by members of the duke's household staff. \nThe Queen will travel with a lady-in-waiting in the state Bentley at the end of the procession, and enter the chapel by a side door.\nThe duke's association with the Royal Navy will be reflected at the service, with buglers of the Royal Marines sounding Action Stations - a signal that all hands should be ready for battle - during the service.\nA reduced choir of four singers will feature but the congregation will follow Covid rules and not sing.\nThe funeral will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, with the Archbishop of Canterbury pronouncing the blessing.\nThe full order of service will be released on Friday evening.\nRead more: Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral?\nThe Duke of Edinburgh personally selected the regalia that will be on the altar for his funeral.\nIt is made up of the medals and decorations conferred on him by UK and Commonwealth countries - together with his Royal Air Force wings and Field Marshal's baton, and insignia from Denmark and Greece, highlighting his birth heritage as a prince of Greece and Denmark.\nHRH The Duke of Edinburgh Remembered: BBC One, Friday 16 April, 19:00-20:05\nThe Funeral of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh: BBC One, Saturday 17 April, 12:30-16:20 and 20:10-21:10\nThe funeral will also be broadcast on Saturday 17 April from 14:00-16:10 on Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live, BBC World Service English, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio Ulster. \nIt will also be broadcast on BBC Radio Wales and BBC local radio with some variation in start times."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPeople in Scotland can now travel between council areas for non-essential reasons and meet in groups of six from up to six different households. The Scottish government says it's relaxing the rules earlier than planned to boost people's mental health and wellbeing. Non-essential shops, leisure centres, pubs and restaurants are still not scheduled to reopen until 26 April.\nA company in which Health Secretary Matt Hancock and his sister have shares has this year won contracts worth \u00a3300,000 from NHS Wales, it has emerged. The government says Mr Hancock acted \"entirely properly\" and was advised by civil servants before he accepted the shares that there would be no conflict of interest. As a UK government minister, Mr Hancock has no responsibility for NHS Wales and a spokesman said he had no involvement in awarding contracts.\nA therapist says the pandemic has fuelled a rise in a debilitating mental health condition known as health anxiety. As Andrew Kersley explores, it can lead to job losses and even suicidal thoughts. He hears from people including a bus driver who couldn't stop thinking one of his passengers would infect him and a woman who would spend an hour washing the supermarket shop.\nCatherine used to be a huge believer in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. She tells disinformation reporter Marianna Spring what made her question her beliefs, and her ideas on how others can be helped out of the online rabbit hole.  \nThere's hope yet for a summer break abroad - at least according to the boss of Europe's largest tour company. Friedrich Joussen, who runs TUI, says successful vaccine programmes in the UK, US and EU can prevent another washout for holidaymakers. \"We are still confident that we will have a decent summer,\" says Mr Joussen, adding his company - which owns a fleet of aircraft, cruise ships and a chain of travel agencies - had taken 2.8 million bookings in March alone.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nHere's what students can expect from university life as lockdown eases.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Television,Peaky Blinders,Film",
      "text": "Actress Helen McCrory, known for her roles in Peaky Blinders and three Harry Potter films, has died of cancer at the age of 52, her husband, the actor Damian Lewis, announced.\nHe said he was \"heartbroken\", and that she was a \"beautiful and mighty woman\".\nHe wrote: \"She blazed so brightly. Go now, Little One, into the air, and thank you.\"\nHarry Potter author JK Rowling led the tributes, writing that it was \"simply heartbreaking news\".\nMcCrory was also known for her long and acclaimed career on stage, and the National Theatre's artistic director Rufus Norris said she was \"unquestionably one of the great actors of her generation\".\nPeaky Blinders creator Steven Knight said: \"Helen was one of the great actors of her generation.  She was so powerful and controlled and this is so sad.\"\nCillian Murphy, who played Tommy Shelby in the show, added he was \"broken-hearted to lose such a dear friend\", describing her as \"a beautiful, caring, funny, compassionate human being\". \n\"She was also a gifted actor - fearless and magnificent. She elevated and made humane every scene, every character she played,\" he said, adding it was \"a privilege to have worked with this brilliant woman... I will dearly miss my pal\".\nBBC director of drama Piers Wenger added: \"Helen was one of the finest actresses this country will ever see.\"\nHomeland star Lewis said she had died \"after an heroic battle with cancer\".\n\"The beautiful and mighty woman that is Helen McCrory has died peacefully at home, surrounded by a wave of love from family and friends,\" he said.\n\"She died as she lived. Fearlessly. God we love her and we know how lucky we are to have had her in our lives.\"\nMcCrory married Homeland star Lewis in 2007 and they had two children. Last year, the couple raised more than \u00a31m to provide NHS workers with meals from high street restaurants during the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic.\nComedian Matt Lucas, who worked with them on the FeedNHS campaign, tweeted that she \"will be remembered not just for her remarkable stage and screen performances, but also for her selflessness and generosity\".\nIn April 2020, McCrory and Lewis appeared on the BBC's Newscast and she explained why they set up FeedNHS.\n\"We've got lots of friends in the NHS and when this outbreak happened, they said one of the big problems they had was all the cafes and restaurants around the hospitals were closing. And the hours they were doing were longer and longer, and they weren't able to get food.\n\"We decided we wanted to try and get food to these people working such long hours and weren't able to.\"\nThe couple also appeared just weeks ago on Good Morning Britain, to talk about charity work for the Prince's Trust.\nIn her tribute, Rowling wrote: \"I'm devastated to learn of the death of Helen McCrory, an extraordinary actress and a wonderful woman who's left us far too soon.\n\"My deepest condolences to her family, especially her husband and children.\"\nMcCrory played Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius Malfoy and Draco's mother, in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2.\nThe actress was perhaps best known for playing Aunt Polly, the matriarch of the Shelby clan, in all five series of hit BBC period gang drama Peaky Blinders from its start in 2013.\n\"She really is the brains with Tommy behind the family, and you see the difference of how to rule,\" she said when speaking about 2014's second series.\nIn his tribute, the BBC's Piers Wenger said: \"Helen's fearlessness made every part she played unique and unmissable.\n\"Her body of work speaks of her extraordinary talent, what it doesn't speak of is her kindness, intelligence and sense of fun. This is too soon, too cruel.\"\nHer other screen roles included the MP Clair Dowar in 2012 James Bond movie Skyfall, and former Prime Minister Tony Blair's wife Cherie in the films The Queen and The Special Relationship.\nShe provided the voice of Stelmaria, Lord Asriel's snow leopard daemon, in the recent BBC One TV series His Dark Materials, and the show's Twitter account called her \"uniquely talented\".\nBafta, the British film and TV academy, wrote: \"We're sad to hear of the death of actor Helen McCrory. As well as fearless Polly Gray in Bafta-winning Peaky Blinders, she was in 2007 Best Film Bafta winner The Queen, amongst many other films and TV shows.\"\nBBC One series Doctor Who also paid tribute to the actress, who appeared in 2010 episode The Vampires of Venice.\nAs well as her film and TV credits, she played seven lead roles at the National Theatre, whose boss Rufus Norris said: \"With her incisive wit and ferocious intelligence, she was one of the most charismatic and distinctive performers.\n\"She was also a deeply beloved member of this theatre's broader community.\"\nShe also worked at the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Almeida and the Donmar Warehouse, and earned rave reviews for her role in Uncle Vanya in London and New York in 2002 and 2003.\nMcCrory was nominated for two of London's Olivier Awards for playing Rosalind in As You Like It in 2006, and for The Last of the Haussmans in 2013.\nFilm and theatre director Sir Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall, remembered her as \"an astonishing talent, a fabulous person, and an absolute true original\".\nHe said: \"The film and theatre world has lost a one of a kind actress, and her family and friends have been robbed of an extraordinary, indomitable spirit. The world will be an infinitely poorer place without Helen in it.\"\nMcCrory also formed the theatrical production company The Public with fellow actor and Staged star Michael Sheen. On Friday, he said she was \"so funny, so passionate, so smart and one of the greatest actors of our time\".\nHe wrote: \"From the first moment I met her when we were just kids it was obvious she was very special. It was an honour to work with her and know her. Much love to Damian and her family. Heartbreaking.\"\nA diplomat's daughter, her family moved to Cameroon and Tanzania as a toddler, the latter of which she later described as \"my most formative country\".\n\"I loved Africa and it stays with you,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs last year.\nShe said she caught the performance bug while performing in the school choir.\n\"That night I will never forget walking in and standing on that stage, having been not that interested up till then\u2026 Suddenly the orchestra started up and I sang so loudly, and the whole body vibrated,\" she recalled.\n\"It was the most extraordinary thing I'd ever been part of. It was a piece of music I would never ever be capable of writing, and I realised from a very young age I would never be original. I would never be a great artist.\n\"But what I could do is I could be part of another great artist's work. I could be an interpreter. That felt so good, not being me.\"\nShe spoke on Newscast about the coronavirus pandemic, saying it had been \"so overwhelming\". \n\"It seems fantastical, you think you're absolutely fine, you're pottering along, you're coping with it, cleaning, cooking, cleaning, cooking and you suddenly burst into tears, and it's the fear and it's the vulnerability coming out. And then you pick yourself up and you go along again, as if nothing happened, and it's surreal.\"\nShe added that during lockdown they had done \"quite a lot of painting and music\", and joked: \"If you're still for too long, I will bleach you.\" \nIn 2003, she met Lewis when they both starred in a play called Five Gold Rings at the Almeida Theatre London.\n\"He makes me laugh, and that was quite apparent quite early on,\" she said. \"He just never lets me get away with anything, and that would make me laugh even more. So I think we hit it off pretty quickly.\n\"We had a bumpy courtship\u2026 We are completely different as people, but we're very similar in our values and very rarely disagree about fundamental things.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Outdoor hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland will be allowed to open on 30 April. \nNew indicative dates were agreed by ministers on Thursday after a meeting of the executive at Stormont.\nUnlicensed and licensed premises such as restaurants, beer gardens, and cafes can open outdoors earlier than expected, as can gyms.\nIndoor hospitality venues, including pubs and hotels, are then to reopen on 24 May.\nNon-essential retail will reopen from 30 April. \nStormont ministers agreed the dates for the reopening of a number of sectors.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster told a special sitting of the NI Assembly that it was a \"landmark day\".\n\"We must also stress that while we are taking important decisions today, the virus is still with us,\" Mrs Foster said.  \n\"It is still dangerous and we cannot drop our guard.  People are still being infected, hospitals are still receiving patients and unfortunately people are still at risk of serious illness and death.  \n\"So we ask everyone to be mindful.  Step out, but step carefully.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a day of optimism. \n\"The restrictions have been a necessary way to supress the virus, to save lives and protect our health service. But they have taken their toll. And it is incumbent on us to move forward as soon as circumstances allow,\" she said. \n\"But we must do so with caution and have maximum mitigations in place to avoid the virus reclaiming its grip on our society.\"\nNI Retail Consortium director Aodh\u00e1n Connolly said the announcement on the reopening of retail had brought clarity.\nRetail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the announcement was a \"very significant step forward for the reopening of our high streets\".\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said it was \"important to bring optimism and certainty to this improving picture\".\n\"Every one of us has a part to play in maintaining progress - by getting vaccinated when our turn comes and by sticking with the actions that have served us well for the past year - including social distancing, wearing a mask, washing hands. It's also vital to remember that outdoor settings are significantly safer than indoors,\" Mr Swann said. \nMr Swann said on Wednesday that the time was right for the NI Executive to further ease restrictions, after some outdoor retail reopened on Monday.\nIt is understood Northern Ireland's R-number for community transmission is now sitting between 0.9 and 1.4, compared to 0.4 to 0.6 last week. \nThere have been two more Covid-19-related deaths recorded in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours, with a further 159 people testing positive.\nAdvice from health officials states this may be partly due to a \"rebound effect\" after the Easter holidays, the extent of which should become apparent in the next week.\nThe pace of today was surprising. \nWe seemed to have gone from a slow and cautious waltz to a fast moving jive. All along for the last couple of weeks we were told by the health minister and the chief medical officer that it had to be slow and it had to be cautious. \nBut now today the reopening dates came a lot sooner than what we had envisaged, which is good news and can happen, as long as people remain vigilant. \nWe can go to the hairdressers and can go out for a drink and enjoy a coffee in cafes, but officials are concerned about what will happen behind closed doors. \nWe don't have any assurances that there will not be another lockdown. \nThe fear is that as we go into the summer, perhaps we will mostly staycation, but if people travel and come back with another variant, something we don't know of yet, we will perhaps see more people getting sick because the vaccine won't stand the type of variant. \nWhile this is a good day and one we have all been looking forward to, to enjoy the restrictions being lifted in the long term, we are still being advised that we have to be cautious. \nMrs Foster said decisions are aimed at lifting restrictions \"where we can\".  \n\"We cannot do everything people would want.  We are sorry about that and we know it will be disappointing for some,\" she said. \n Ms O'Neill said decisions had been made \"carefully\". \n\"We know that everyone out there is looking for certainty on next steps.  We cannot guarantee every step towards the end of this but we do want to give hope,\" the deputy first minister said. \nProposed dates leaked to the media earlier had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. \nHowever, Economy Minister Diane Dodds had raised concerns via a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises. \nNorthern Ireland took some further gradual steps out of lockdown on Monday, when all pupils returned to school for the first time since Christmas. \nNorthern Ireland was the last part of the UK to lift its stay-at-home rule, which came into effect in January, in a bid to suppress a large rise in cases of coronavirus."

      "tags": "US gun violence,Gun crime",
      "text": "The gunman who killed eight people at a FedEx facility in the US city of Indianapolis was a former employee, the company says.\nPolice named the suspect as 19-year-old Brandon Hole, who last worked at the company in 2020. \nHe began shooting \"randomly\" almost immediately after exiting his car, according to police.\nSeven people were also injured and the gunman apparently killed himself before police arrived, officials say.\nThis is the latest incident in a recent increase in mass shootings across the US.\nAt least four of those killed were members of the Sikh community, according to local media. Gurinder Singh Khalsa, a leader of the local Sikh community, told Reuters news agency that the FedEx facility was known for employing members of the community who did not speak fluent English. \nA statement from FedEx chairman and CEO Frederick Smith described the incident as a \"senseless act of violence\". \n\"First and foremost, I want to express my deepest sympathies to the families, friends, and co-workers of those team members. Our priority now is in responding to the situation on the ground and helping our team members and law enforcement,\" the statement said. \nOrdering flags to be flown at half-mast, President Joe Biden described the recent mass shootings as a \"national embarrassment\". \n\"It has to end,\" Mr Biden said. \"Every day there's a mass shooting in the United States if you count all those who were killed out in the streets of our cities and our rural areas, it's a national embarrassment and it must come to an end.\"\nThe attack began around 23:00 local time (03:00 GMT) on Thursday in Indianapolis, Indiana - the state capital and its largest city.\nIn a news conference on Friday, city officials said no motive had been established yet, and noted that one may never be determined.\n\"We'll never really know all the ins and outs of why this occurred, but we'll try our best,\" said police chief Randal Taylor.\nCraig McCartt, the deputy chief of criminal investigations, said that the gunman began firing as soon as he arrived at the building.\n\"This suspect came to the facility and when he came there, he got out of his car and pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility,\"  he said.\n\"No confrontation or argument, he just appeared to randomly start shooting,\" he added.\nFour people were found dead outside the building, and another four inside.\nThe attacker, who appeared to have shot himself \"minutes\" before police arrived, was also found inside the facility.\n\"When officers arrived they found a very chaotic and active crime scene,\" Mr McCartt said, adding that they believed the gunman used a rifle during the attack. \nMayor Joe Hogsett paid condolences to the victims and called for Americans to tackle the \"scourge of gun violence that has killed far too many in our community and in our country\".\nHe also called for people to fight against \"the assumption that this is how it must be and we might as well get used to it\".\n\"We need the courage that compels courageous acts.\"\nThe FBI, which is assisting in the investigation, has been searching a residence in the area, officials said, but they refused to answer whether it was the suspect's home.\nA statement from FBI Indianapolis Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan, said a shotgun was seized from the suspect in 2020 after his mother told authorities that he might try to get killed by a law enforcement officer, CBS News reports. \nThe suspect was interviewed last April and \"no racially motivated violent extremism ideology was identified during the course of the assessment,\" Mr Keenan said. \nLocal media quoted FedEx worker Jeremiah Miller as saying he had seen the gunman firing.\n\"I saw a man with a sub-machine gun of some sort, an automatic rifle, and he was firing in the open. I immediately ducked down and got scared,\" he said.\nThis is the third mass shooting in Indianapolis this year. Five were killed, including a pregnant woman, in a shooting in January. In March, three adults and one child were killed after an argument broke out over a coronavirus stimulus cheque.\nThe Gun Violence Archive puts the number of gun violence deaths from all causes at 12,395 so far this year in the US, of which 147 were in mass shootings. Last year saw a total of 43.549 deaths, and 610 in mass shootings.\nLast week, President Joe Biden announced his first steps since taking office to tighten gun controls following a series of mass shootings.  \nIt includes efforts to set rules for certain guns, bolster background checks and support local violence prevention."

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh has been laid to rest in an intimate funeral at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nThe Dean of Windsor paid tribute to Prince Philip's \"kindness, humour and humanity\" during the ceremony. \nThe congregation wore masks and was socially distanced in line with Covid rules, with the Queen seated alone.\nThe duke's children walked behind his coffin in a funeral procession, followed by a national minute's silence.\nMore than 730 members of the armed forces took part in the event, but there was a limit of 30 mourners inside St George's Chapel, under coronavirus rules.\nPrince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April, aged 99.\nHis coffin was carried the short distance to St George's Chapel on a modified Land Rover, which the duke himself helped to design. \nThe funeral procession was headed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, the Major General's party, and military service chiefs. \nPrincess Anne and Prince Charles made up the front row behind the vehicle, followed by Prince Edward and Prince Andrew.\nPrince William and Prince Harry walked either side of their cousin Peter Phillips. \nThe brothers sat on opposite sides of the aisle but were seen chatting together after they left the service. \nVice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon also walked behind the coffin, trailed by members of the duke's household staff. \nThe Queen, 94, travelled with a lady-in-waiting in the State Bentley at the end of the procession.\nA ceremonial gun fire at nine locations across the UK and in Gibraltar marked the start and end of the national minute's silence.\nNo planes landed or took off at Heathrow for six minutes to coincide with the silence and all major sporting events were rescheduled to avoid a clash with the funeral.\nThe funeral service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor, with the Archbishop of Canterbury pronouncing the blessing.\nThe Dean paid tribute to Prince Philip's \"kindness, humour and humanity\" and the \"many ways in which his long life has been a blessing to us\".\n\"We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,\" he said during his bidding.\nThe duke's association with the Royal Navy and love of the sea was also a focus of the service but no sermon was delivered, in line with his wishes.\nThe music included the 1860 hymn Eternal Father, Strong to Save, by William Whiting, which is associated with seafarers and the maritime armed services.\nThere was a reduced choir of four singers but the congregation did not sing, in line with coronavirus restrictions.\nBuglers of the Royal Marines sounded Action Stations - a signal that all hands should be ready for battle - as the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault at the end of the service.\nBuckingham Palace said the funeral plans had been modified to take into account public health guidelines.\nThe funeral took place entirely within the grounds of the castle and the public were asked not to gather there or at other royal residences. \nBut the ceremonial aspects of the day and the service remained in line with Prince Philip's wishes and reflected his military affiliations and personal elements of his life.\nAhead of the funeral, the Queen shared a favourite photograph of herself with her husband in Aberdeenshire.\nTaken by the Countess of Wessex in 2003, the picture shows the couple relaxing on a picnic rug on the grass at the Coyles of Muick beauty spot, near the Queen's private estate of Balmoral.\nby BBC reporter Harry Farley\nSilence descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's funeral.\nThe Royal Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would otherwise have been.\nBut hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects.\nAs the funeral service was under way in St George's Chapel, a short distance away in Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an end.\nMikey Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times because of the pandemic.\nHe said it had felt \"strange\" to learn last week that their wedding would be taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral.\n\"Obviously we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously, there's a lot of people around to mourn.\"\nJodie added: \"We definitely didn't want to overtake from anything that's happening today. It is a very sad occasion. But we are delighted to finally be married.\"\nThe 30 guests at the funeral wore morning coats with medals, or day dress, but not military uniform.\nThe Queen and duke's four children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - and eight grandchildren attended, but none of their young great-grandchildren.\nSpouses of the children and grandchildren are among the congregation, including two who have married into the family in recent years - Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, husbands of Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice.\nBut the Duke of Sussex's wife, Meghan, is heavily pregnant and was advised by her doctors not to fly in from the US. She was said to have watched the service from home.\nThe other mourners included the children of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and three of Prince Philip's German relatives - Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg."

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will be a \"profound\" chance for the Queen to say farewell to her husband of 73 years, the Archbishop of Canterbury has said. \n\"She will behave with the extraordinary dignity, extraordinary courage that she always does,\" Justin Welby said.\nPrince Philip's funeral will take place at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle at 15:00 BST on Saturday. \nThe duke's children will walk behind his hearse during the procession.\nAt the ceremony, there will only be 30 mourners in line with coronavirus restrictions.\nBuckingham Palace said the Queen had faced \"some very difficult\" decisions in selecting the mourners from the 800-strong congregation originally planned, and she wanted all branches of her husband's family to be represented.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Welby said many people had seen family members die in the Covid pandemic this year and the funeral service would \"resonate very deeply for a lot of people\".\nHe said: \"I think there will be tears in many homes because other names will be on their minds, faces they've lost that they don't see again, funerals they couldn't go to as many haven't been able to go to this one because it is limited to 30 in the congregation. That will break many a heart.\"\nMr Welby said he expected the Queen at the service to \"behave with the extraordinary dignity, extraordinary courage that she always does\".\nHe added: \"And at the same time she is saying farewell to someone to whom she was married for 73 years. I think that must be a very, very profound thing... in anybody's life.\"\nThe archbishop, who will pronounce the blessing at the funeral service, suggested that people of faith could pray for the Queen, or alternatively \"sympathise and in their hearts offer their condolences to her and the hope for her to find strength in what must be an anguished moment\".\nMeanwhile, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their daughter Lady Louise Windsor have been viewing flowers and cards left in memory of Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.\nEarlier, the head of the UK's armed forces said the funeral will have the duke's \"fingerprints [all] over it\" and it \"reflects his wide interests and his attention to detail\".\n\"It's obviously been slightly affected by Covid, but nonetheless it will reflect military precision,\" said Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of defence staff.\nAmong the funeral details that Prince Philip was involved in is the specially-modified Land Rover hearse, which the duke helped to design over 16 years. He requested it be repainted in military green and helped to design the open top rear of the car.\nThe duke also personally selected the regalia - medals, decorations and insignia - that will be on the altar for his funeral.\nSir Nick hailed the \"extraordinary war record\" of Prince Philip - who served in the Royal Navy in World War Two - and the dozens of different military decorations and awards he had.\n\"I think people will realise that this is a life worth looking into and I think they will be surprised by what he achieved and what he did in his 99 years,\" he said. \nThe Queen has decided that there will be no military uniforms worn by members of the Royal Family, and those attending will instead wear morning coats with medals, or day dress.\nHelena Wilkinson, news correspondent in Windsor\nBehind the walls of Windsor Castle, in the spring sunshine, the Duke's youngest son and daughter-in law viewed some of the flowers left by members of the public.\nAccompanied by their daughter Lady Louise, the Countess of Wessex crouched at times to read some of the many messages and tributes from organisations affiliated with Prince Philip. \nOne of the wreaths had been sent by the prime minister with a message paying tribute to a man whom the \"nation owes more than words can say\".\nThe hundreds of bouquets had been moved from one of the castle gates to outside St George's Chapel, where the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place on Saturday.\nGardeners have been busy mowing lawns, making sure everything is just right. \nA full rehearsal has also taken place. Every last detail is being pored over and practised to perfection, just as the duke would have expected, just as he would have wanted. \nWindsor is a town used to big royal occasions.  But many here have accepted that the day will be rather different than normal. \nStreets won't be lined with mourners, a public procession won't take place. \nThis town though will, in its own private way, say goodbye to Prince Philip, who many here saw not just as the duke, but as a neighbour who was very much part of the community. \nPrince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April aged 99. \nThe procession to the funeral service will be headed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, followed by the Household Division and military service chiefs.\nThe duke's four children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - as well as his grandsons the Duke of Cambridge, Duke of Sussex and Peter Phillips will be among those walking behind the coffin. \nThe Queen will travel with a lady-in-waiting in the state Bentley at the end of the procession, and enter the chapel by a side door.\nIn line with Covid lockdown rules, the 30-person congregation inside the chapel will put on masks and socially distance, with the Queen seated alone.\nRoyal historian Professor Kate Williams said she thought it would be \"a very striking image\" to see the Queen sitting alone rather than with the other mourners.\n\"They'll be wearing masks and sitting in their bubbles in St George's Chapel. And the Queen doesn't have a bubble, the bubble was Prince Philip,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\nThe other mourners include the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge as well as all of the duke's grandchildren and their spouses, apart from the Duchess of Sussex, who is heavily pregnant and will remain in the US.\nThe children of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, will also be in attendance, along with three of Prince Philip's German relatives - Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.\nThe Countess Mountbatten of Burma, previously known as Lady Romsey and later Lady Brabourne - who was Prince Philip's partner when he pursued his sporting hobby of carriage driving - will also be in attendance.\nA Downing Street spokesman said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would watch the funeral on television from his country residence Chequers. \nMeanwhile, Heathrow Airport said no planes would land or take off for six minutes to coincide with a national minute's silence at 15:00 BST on Saturday, to mark the start of the funeral. \nThe full order of the funeral service, which will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, will be released on Friday evening.\nRead more: Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral?\nRoyal Family tree and line of succession \nHRH The Duke of Edinburgh Remembered: BBC One, Friday 16 April, 19:00-20:05\nThe Funeral of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh: BBC One, Saturday 17 April, 12:30-16:20 and 20:10-21:10\nThe funeral will also be broadcast on Saturday 17 April from 14:00-16:10 on Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live, BBC World Service English, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio Ulster. \nIt will also be broadcast on BBC Radio Wales and BBC local radio with some variation in start times."

      "text": "More families and friends have been able to reunite in parks, gardens and beaches across Scotland after months in lockdown. \nRestrictions have been eased allowing people to travel between council areas and meet more people outdoors.\nMichael Mancini, who runs the Ice Cream Factory at Troon, South Ayrshire, said the beach was \"heaving\" with visitors. \n\"We have been absolutely flying today. It has been brilliant, absolutely brilliant,\" he told BBC Radio Scotland. \nThe change to the rules means it is now possible to travel out of your local area for non-essential reasons and for six people from up to six households to meet up outdoors.\nThe relaxation had not been due to come into force until 26 April but the government said the changes were being made earlier in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing.\nHowever, significant restrictions remain in place.\nPeople cannot stay overnight outside their council area - even in a tent or caravan.\nAnd the advice remains to shop within your own council area unless there are no practical alternatives.\nWhile six people can meet up outdoors, the guidance is to minimise meetings, maintain 2m distancing and \"use common sense\".\nSt Andrews' famous West Sands beach was one popular spot for family reunions.\nAnn Buchanan, who lives near Stirling, met up with relatives from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, whom she had not seen since last year.\nShe told BBC Scotland: \"We have not been able to meet up for ages, for such a long time, and it is really nice to get together here.\n\"This is such a lovely place to come and relax and have a bit of a catch up.\"\nMs Buchanan joked: \"This is the furthest I have driven in a year. It's just like passing your driving test again.\"\nAndrew McVie, 27, from Glasgow, said he was \"super excited\" to be visiting Millport, on the Isle of Cumbrae, to cycle round the island for the first time in more than two years.\nThe clerical assistant said: \"You can do it in about two hours if you don't stop. It's why a lot of people like it.\n\"There's great scenery and it's a really nice, friendly, welcoming place and it's a beautiful day.\n\"I've missed it so much not being able to go because of the travel restrictions but I'll still be taking precautions.\"\nMr McVie added that he plans to visit Edinburgh with friends on on Saturday for the first time in more than a year.\nJames Fraser, chairman of The Friends of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime the national park was not as busy as he had anticipated.\nMr Fraser put this down to people prioritising meeting up with their loved ones on day one of the travel restrictions being eased.\nBut he added: \"I think it will be a lot busier over the weekend if this weather holds up. There is no doubt about that so we would advise people to travel early.\n\"I am sure we will get to a stage where all the car parks are full and people will be getting turned away.\"\nDouglas Cairns, of Traffic Scotland's control centre, urged people to allow extra time for their journeys.\nHe told the programme: \"This is the first relaxation where we are allowed to travel outwith our local authority area so there will be a slight increase in demand and, obviously, that is based around weather as well.\"\nEarlier, Scotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that people may be uncertain about using another household's toilet during a meet up - but that \"pragmatism\" was important.\nHe said: \"Of course there might be a risk going into someone's house but if people are very, very careful and they make sure they're taking precautions - washing their hands afterwards -  nipping in to use someone's toilet is not something I think anyone would frown on. \n\"What we don't want to see is people using that as an excuse to nip inside for cup of tea with people and sitting in unventilated areas.\"\nHe said the outdoors - with \"free circulating air\" - was much safer than indoors. \nThe next significant easing of restrictions on 26 April should see all shops and some hospitality reopen.\nAt that point, someone visiting a friend in another part of the country will be able choose to book into a hotel or bed and breakfast for the night.\nAll remaining shops and close contact services like nail salons are also due to reopen on 26 April.\nPubs, bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars will be able to serve people outdoors - in groups of up to six from six households - until 22:00 from that date.\nAlcohol will be permitted, and there will be no requirement for food to be served.\nTakeaways will be able to resume normal service, with physical distancing and face masks worn in premises\nThere will also be a partial resumption of indoor hospitality, with food and non-alcoholic drinks being served until 20:00 for groups of up to four people from no more than two households.

Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. \nThese are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. \nThe procession to St George's Chapel for the funeral service was led by the band of the Grenadier Guards. \nThe band was followed by the Major General's party and military chiefs of staff, including the Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Carter, and First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin.\nAdmiral Radakin paid tribute to the duke's naval career, saying: \"He was one of us.\"\nIn procession behind the specially adapted Land Rover carrying Prince Philip's coffin were Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry.

      "text": "Chicago police have released graphic footage of an officer shooting dead a 13-year-old boy in a dark alley.\nBodycam video shows the policeman shouting \"drop it\" before shooting Adam Toledo once in the chest on 29 March.\nThe boy does not appear to be holding a weapon in the split second he is shot, but police video shows a handgun near the spot where he falls.\nSmall protests were held on Thursday evening around Chicago, hours after the city's mayor appealed for calm. \nThe video's release follows the fatal police shooting on 11 April of Daunte Wright by an officer in a Minneapolis suburb. \nThat shooting has sparked violent protests as the city awaits the outcome of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer accused in the death of George Floyd.\nThe clip shows the officer jumping out of his squad car and chasing the Latino boy on foot down a dark alley as another suspect disappears from view. \nThe policeman shouts: \"Police! Stop! Stop right [expletive] now! Hands! Hands! Show me your [expletive] hands!\"\nThe boy turns and raises his hands. The officer shouts \"Drop it\" and fires his weapon - 19 seconds after exiting his squad car.\nSeparate CCTV footage appears to show the teenager throwing something through a gap in the fence as the officer runs up to him. Bodycam video shows officers shining a light on a handgun behind the wooden fence after the shooting.\nThe policeman calls for an ambulance while urging the fallen boy to \"stay awake\". Other officers arrive at the scene in the Little Village neighbourhood on the city's west side and CPR is performed.\nAccording to prosecutors, the teenager was with a 21-year-old man, Ruben Roman, who had just fired a gun at a passing car. The gunfire drew police to the area, resulting in the deadly confrontation. \nMr Roman appeared in court on Saturday charged with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, reckless discharge of a firearm and child endangerment, according to local media reports. \nThe Civilian Office of Police Accountability released the bodycam footage on Thursday along with CCTV video, arrest reports and audio recordings of the shots fired in the area that alerted police.\nShortly before the video was released, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot held a press conference where she called the footage \"excruciating\" to watch.\n\"Simply put, we failed Adam,\" she said. \"And we cannot afford to fail one more young person in our city.\"\nMayor Lightfoot urged the public to remain peaceful.\n\"We live in a city that is traumatised by a long history of police violence and misconduct,\" the mayor said. \"So while we don't have enough information to be the judge and jury of this particular situation, it is certainly understandable why so many of our residents are feeling that all too familiar surge of outrage and pain.\"\nThe Toledo family also appealed for calm.\n\"We have heard reports in the media that more protests are planned today, and while we have no direct knowledge of such events, we pray that for the sake of our city, people remain peaceful to honour Adam's memory and work constructively to promote reform,\" they said in a statement. \nOn Thursday night, protestors called on Ms Lightfoot and the city's police superintendent David Brown to resign, alleging that authorities have dragged their feet in sharing information about the case and have not punished the officer involved.\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Toledo family lawyer Adeena Weiss Ortiz said the boy had not been holding a gun in the moment he was shot.\nBut she said they could not say with \"100% certainty\" whether the teenager had been carrying a weapon just beforehand, the Chicago Tribune reported.\nThe officer who fired the fatal shot, Eric Stillman, has not been officially accused of wrongdoing. He has been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of an inquiry into whether he followed proper procedure on use of force.\nIn a statement, Mr Stillman's lawyer said there was \"irrefutable evidence\" his client had done the right thing because \"all prior attempts to deescalate and gain compliance with all of the officer's lawful orders had failed\".\nThe attorney added it was \"amazing and disheartening\" that nobody had asked about Mr Stillman's well-being after the incident.\nMr Stillman is a 34-year-old military veteran who joined the force in 2015. He has had four use of force reports and three complaints filed against him, according to the Invisible Institute, which publishes data about police misconduct in Chicago.\nThe Chicago-Sun Times reports that the Chicago Police Department has been on alert for potential retaliation against officers because the area where Adam Toledo was shot is a stronghold of the Latin Kings street gang.\nJohn Catanzara, president of the Chicago Police Union, alleged live on CNN that Toledo was a Latin Kings member and his shooting was \"100% justified\" and \"heroic\".\nAccording to a database compiled by the Washington Post Newspaper, 265 people have been killed by police so far this year in the US."

      "text": "A 21-year old university student developed heart failure after \"excessive\" consumption of energy drinks, a new report suggests.\nFor two years, the man drank four 500ml energy drinks a day, according to the BMJ Case Report.\nHe spent 58 days in hospital, including the intensive care unit which he described as \"traumatising\".\nBefore the hospital admission, he suffered with shortness of breath and weight loss for four months.\nDoctors treating him considered a number of diagnoses, but concluded: \"Energy drink-induced cardiotoxicity was felt to be the most likely cause.\"\nAn organ transplant was considered after tests revealed both his heart and kidneys had failed - with the kidney failure linked to a long-standing but previously undiagnosed condition.\nThe unnamed patient contributed to the report, and was unable to continue his university studies three months before hospital admission because of his health.\n\"When I was drinking up to four energy drinks per day, I suffered from tremors and heart palpitations, which interfered with my ability to concentrate on daily tasks and my studies at university.\"\nAfter nine months his heart function has appeared to have returned with \"mildly impaired function\", but the report said it was difficult to predict recovery or potential for relapse.\nThe student suffered from severe migraine headaches which would \"often occur during the periods\" when he didn't have energy drinks. \n\"This also restricted my ability to perform day-to-day tasks and even leisurely activities such as going to the park or taking a walk,\" he said.\nHe felt there should be more awareness about energy drinks and the effect of their contents.\n\"I believe they are very addictive and far too accessible to young children. I think warning labels, similar to smoking, should be made to illustrate the potential dangers of the ingredients in energy drink,\" he added.\nThis comes after a separate study done by researchers at Cardiff University analysed the responses of a health survey of more than 176,000 secondary school children in Wales aged 11 to 16 between 2013 and 2017.\nIt found that 6% of pupils said they drank energy drinks on a \"daily\" basis - a trend which didn't change over time.\nThe study's lead author Dr Kelly Morgan said there was a difference in consumption between those from low and high socioeconomic groups.\n\"Marketing campaigns for energy drinks are often aimed at those from more disadvantaged backgrounds.\"\nTheir popularity was unlikely to be hit unless policy measures were \"put in place\", Dr Morgan added.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "text": "MPs and peers are calling for funding for families forced to buy medicinal cannabis for their children privately.\nThe treatment was made legal with a prescription in 2018 for those with an \"exceptional clinical need\". \nBut a cross-party letter from 100 politicians says only three NHS prescriptions have been given out since, forcing families to spend thousands on private treatments. \nThe government said it sympathised with those facing hard-to-treat conditions.\nThe change in law came about after the cases of Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell, who had both been denied access to cannabis oil to treat their rare forms of epilepsy. \nThe Home Office later granted the boys licences to access the treatment.\nBut after a review by experts, the then home secretary Sajid Javid introduced legislation to make it legal for specialist doctors to provide prescriptions for cannabis-derived medicinal products in \"exceptional circumstances\".\nOver two years have passed since the law changed, but the All Parliamentary Group on Access to Medical Cannabis Under Prescription said dozens of families were not seeing the benefit. \nIn a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the group's chair, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, said instead, parents were having to fund raise up to \u00a32,000 a month to pay for the treatment privately.\n\"In any circumstance, this is a severe financial burden for families already having to cope with very sick children and Covid restrictions have rendered most fund-raising impossible,\" she added.\n\"The reasons for the lack of NHS prescriptions appear to be complex and will inevitably take time to resolve. However, the families to which we refer simply do not have time. \n\"They are emotionally and financially broken and their children are at risk of being without their life-transforming medicine within weeks.\"\nBacked by 100 MPs and peers from all parties, Ms Antoniazzi appealed to the PM to \"grant access to some form of compassionate funding until the wider issues can be resolved\".\nThe APPG receives help with its administration from campaign group End Our Pain, which has welcomed the intervention. \nGroup director Peter Carroll said the situation was \"desperate\" for the families, telling the BBC: \"When the law was changed, we thought as campaigners 'job done', there will be prescriptions - but it didn't happen.\"\nHe claimed the advice given out by various medical bodies on prescriptions for the treatment had been \"extremely cautious\", and as a result, \"we are in this crazy situation where it is totally legal, but hardly any specialist doctors will prescribe it\". \nBut Mr Carroll said the call for funding for the families was \"the only thing that can work in very short term\".\nHe added: \"We can't fight the other battles and win in weeks - the only way forward right now is to give these families the money to pay for prescriptions in the short term.\n\"I appeal to the government, give them money, stop them having to do online raffles for fundraising so they can focus on caring for some of the sickest children in the country.\"\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We sympathise with every patient and every family courageously confronting life with hard-to-treat conditions.\"\nThe spokesman added that after the law was changed in 2018 on prescriptions, the department was considering \"what further action we can take with regard to broader access to unlicensed cannabis-based products, while giving immediate priority to resolving the supply of Bedrocan oils from the Netherlands, which many patients are receiving.\""

      "text": "Northern Ireland can begin rebuilding its economy under plans to ease Covid-19 restrictions from next week, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said.\nOn Thursday the Stormont executive agreed reopening dates for some sectors, including hairdressers, non-essential retail and hospitality.\nThe current lockdown has been in place for more than 100 days in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus.\nMrs Dodds said precautions would still be needed to reopen businesses safely.\n\"But it does mean we can get on with opening our economy, recovering our economy,\" she told BBC News NI's The View programme.\nShe said growing the economy would help to mitigate the fallout from the pandemic, including a potentially huge spike in unemployment.\nThe announcement has received a cautious welcome from businesses.\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey told The View she was glad the executive had reached consensus.\n\"There was no dissent around the table - it [was] a good day to give hope to the public,\" she said.\nPeter McCleery, who runs a cafe in Comber, County Down, said that preparing to resume trade would be like opening a new business.\nThe cafe has no outdoor space so it is due to open on 24 May, several weeks after hospitality businesses that have outdoor facilities.\n\"Even with those dates we have to plan ahead and recruit staff and train staff,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"We're starting again from a fresh sheet - we're looking forward to it.\"\nThe owner of a County Armagh hotel situated a short distance from the Irish border said he was concerned that business that would have to deal with the consequences of the differing restrictions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nJason Foody said it was not the job of his hotel staff \"to police the roads and people that come through our door\".\nThe Republic of Ireland has recently lifted the 5km (three miles) travel limit that applied under its highest level of restrictions.\nMr Foody said: \"Previously if we were seeing [people with] addresses... from areas that shouldn't have travelled we were saying it to them but people have to travel for different reasons too and if it's for essential reasons you can't stop them.\nHe said the hotel was \"getting a huge amount of calls\" from people in the Republic of Ireland who were wanting to book a stay.\nJules Stothard, who owns a pub in Dromara, County Down, said her business had been open for about three months over the past 13 months.\nShe would be \"ecstatic\" to see her customers again but had a \"bit of anxiety about the financial side\".\n\"We are grateful to the government for the grant but every penny we have had has gone,\" she said.\n\"We were so ecstatic that we could open again but then reality strikes - we won't have the customers at the capacity to sustain our business without help.\"\nTourist attractions also face challenges when they reopen - the Marble Arch Caves in County Fermanagh will have reduced capacity for its tours, says its manager Kate McGrath.\n\"We will get there but need to clarify bubble numbers,\" she added.\nProposed dates leaked to the media on Thursday had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June.\nHowever, Mrs Dodds had raised concerns in a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nPregnant women should be offered a Covid jab in line with their age group, the UK's vaccine advisers have announced. The new guidance from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation says the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are preferable because data from the US in 90,000 pregnant women has not raised any safety concerns. The advice brings the UK into line with other countries.\nCoronavirus infections across all parts of the UK have fallen to the lowest level since September, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. About one in 500 people in the UK was estimated to have had the virus in the week to 10 April. That translates to about 130,000 people in the UK, down sharply from 185,000 the previous week. Find out how many cases are in your area.\nBoris Johnson's visit to India will still go ahead later this month, Downing Street has said, despite soaring coronavirus cases and a new variant that has been identified there. A No 10 spokesman said the prime minister had already scaled down his trip due to India's rising cases - it has reported more than 200,000 a day for the last two days. The variant first identified in India has been found in 73 cases in England and four in Scotland. Officials have called it a \"variant under investigation\" rather than \"of concern\".\nFans of Alicia Keys, Haim and Mrs Brown's Boys are still able to buy tickets for their arena shows in June - despite the fact they can't go ahead under the government's roadmap for reopening. Under the current plans, indoor events will not return without social distancing measures until 21 June at the earliest. Fans can only get refunds if shows are officially rescheduled or cancelled. Here's a reminder of which music festivals are planning on going ahead this summer.\nSue Whitehead, 67, and Geoff Shaw, 72, have been dance partners for three years, but lost access to their local studio as Covid-19 rules tightened at the beginning of the year. The pair, who live alone in the West Midlands, decided to bubble together and use Sandwell Valley car park to practise their moves.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAs Scotland opens up a little more, here's a reminder of the rules across the UK - and when the next changes take place.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Windsor",
      "text": "Funeral preparations are under way for Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband, who died on Friday 9 April aged 99. \nThis is what we know about the event.\nThe ceremonial royal funeral will be held at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on Saturday 17 April. \nPrince Philip's body is now resting in the inner hall at Windsor Castle after being moved from its private chapel.\nThe duke is reported to have requested a funeral of minimal fuss and has not lain in state - where members of the public would have been able to view his coffin. \nThe procession and service will be televised - details below.\nCoronavirus restrictions in England mean only 30 people, socially distanced, are allowed to attend funerals. \nThe guest list includes members of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's families, including three of his German relatives.\nPrince Harry will attend but his wife Meghan, who is pregnant, will not make the trip from the US, on medical advice. It is the first time the Duke of Sussex has returned to the UK since stepping down as a senior royal last year.\nAttendees are expected to wear masks in line with government advice. The pallbearers and clergy are not included in the number of attendees.\nThe duke will have a ceremonial funeral, rather than a state funeral. There is a subtle difference - state funerals are usually reserved for monarchs, although wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill was given a state funeral. The Queen Mother had a ceremonial funeral in 2002, as did Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. \nOn the day of the funeral, the coffin will be moved from the private chapel to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle. It will be placed on a modified Land Rover, that the duke himself helped design, to be carried the short distance to St George's Chapel.\nCoronavirus restrictions on crowds and numbers attending funerals mean the duke's ceremonial funeral will be much lower key than if it had happened in other times - although the Palace says this very much \"reflects the duke's wishes\" and it will still \"celebrate and reflect\" a life of service.\nLive online coverage of the procession and funeral begins on the BBC News website and app at 07:00 BST and the service will be streamed in the UK and internationally. \nTelevision coverage in the UK starts at 12:30 BST on Saturday on BBC One, the BBC News Channel and on BBC iPlayer.\nOn the radio, you can follow the day's events between 14:00 BST and 16:10 BST on Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live, and simulcast on BBC World Service English, BBC Radio Scotland, and BBC Radio Ulster. \nBBC Radio Wales and BBC local radio will also cover the event, with start times to be confirmed.\nBy 14:15 BST, the Quadrangle in Windsor Castle will be lined by the Household Cavalry and the Foot Guards, along with military detachments from units that had special connections with Prince Philip on the grass.\nFrom 14:20 BST, those members of the Royal Family and The Duke of Edinburgh's family not taking part in the procession leave Windsor Castle by car for St George's Chapel.\nAt 14:40 BST, the bands in the Quadrangle stop playing and the coffin will be carried out and placed onto the Land Rover.\nMembers of the Royal Family walking in the procession will leave the State Entrance after the coffin and take up their positions.\nBehind the Land Rover will be Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry. They are joined by Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon. Members of the duke's staff will follow behind them, including his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller Bakewell, a personal protection officer, two pages and two valets.\nAt 14:45 BST, the procession begins. Led by the band of the Grenadier Guards, the procession will move from the Quadrangle to Horseshoe Cloister. The band is followed by the Major General's party and military chiefs of staff. The Land Rover follows, flanked by pallbearers from the Royal Marines and other regiments and corps associated with the duke. The Royal Family members and staff follow behind.\nThe Queen will travel at the rear of the procession in the State Bentley and will enter St George's chapel through the Galilee porch.\nThe procession route will be lined by personnel from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, The Highlanders, 4th Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Air Force.\nGuns will be fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery from the East Lawn throughout, as a bell tolls in the Curfew Tower, at the west end of the castle. \nAt 14:53 BST, the Land Rover will arrive at West Steps of St George's Chapel, and be met by a guard of honour and band from the Rifles Regiment, who will play the national anthem.\nMembers of the Household Cavalry will line the West Steps and a Royal Navy \"piping party\" will pipe a nautical call known as \"the Still\" as the coffin is carried up the steps to the chapel.\nThe coffin, draped with the duke's standard, with a wreath and the duke's naval cap and sword on top, will be met by the dean of Windsor, together with the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the service.\nOnly the members of the Royal Family will enter the chapel - the rest of the procession will remain outside. \nAt 15:00 BST, a minute's silence will be held nationwide, in memory of the duke. \nThe start and end of the Silence will be signalled by a gun fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.\nInside the chapel, the funeral service will begin as the coffin is carried to the Quire, and placed on a platform called a catafalque. \nA small choir of four singers, who will be in the nave of the chapel, will sing pieces of music chosen by the duke.\nAfter the service, the duke will be interred in the royal vault.\nThe duke's coffin is draped in his personal flag, his standard. The flag represents elements of his life, from his Greek heritage to his British titles. \nWhen the duke got engaged to the then Princess Elizabeth in 1946, he renounced his Greek title and became a British citizen, taking his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten.\nThe Mountbatten family is therefore also represented on the standard, alongside the castle from the arms of the City of Edinburgh - he became Duke of Edinburgh when he married.\nA number of objects personally selected by the duke will be displayed on cushions on the altar in St George's Chapel.\nThese include the duke's insignia - medals and decorations awarded to him by the UK and Commonwealth countries - his field marshal's baton, Royal Air Force wings and insignia from Denmark and Greece \nMembers of the public have been asked not to attend any of the funeral events, in line with public health advice.\nOn the Royal Family website, members of the public are asked to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving floral tributes in memory of the duke. An online book of condolence is also available for the public to post their personal tributes.\nThe period of national mourning ends on the day of the funeral.\nThe Royal Family will continue to observe mourning for another week - but members will attend engagements wearing black mourning bands where appropriate."

In addition, food and alcohol was supplied and consumed on the premises. \n\"I wish to formally interview you in connection with these matters. After discussions with your solicitor I am happy to receive these via written response. \n\"I have attached a list of questions. I must advise you that any response to this letter may be subject to criminal proceedings therefore I must caution you.\" \nIt adds in capital letters: \"You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something that you later rely on in court.  Anything you do say may be used in evidence.\" \nThe Senedd Commission has declined to comment. \nIn a statement, the caterers Charlton House told BBC Wales: \"We continue to co-operate with the ongoing investigation by the Shared Regulatory Services. \n\"However, as this investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\" \nIn statement, SRS told BBC Wales: \"We can confirm that Shared Regulatory Services is currently conducting an investigation into this issue but cannot comment further while this is in progress.\" \nReacting to the latest development, Welsh Conservatives Darren Millar and Paul Davies said: \"We are both very disappointed that Cardiff council has decided to take this action, it is grossly unfair to penalise a staff member in this way.\n\"We have co-operated fully with the authorities and at every stage made clear the staff member was not at fault.\n\"We look forward to the publication of the Standards Commissioner's report as a matter of urgency.\""

      "text": "The rate of coronavirus infections in Canada's biggest province has reached an all-time high as hospitals warn they are close to being overwhelmed. \nA panel of experts say infections in Ontario could increase by 600% by June if public health measures are weak and vaccination rates do not pick up. \nLast week, for the first time since the pandemic began, Canada registered more cases per million than the US.\nAbout 22% of Canadians have now received a first vaccine dose. \nThat compares to 37% in the US. \nOntario is now introducing strict new public measures, including:\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government would help Toronto, the largest city in the country, which has been hard-hit by the latest surge. \n\"We're going to do whatever it takes to help. Discussions are ongoing about extra healthcare providers, and we are ready to step up,\" he said on Friday. \nNew variants - especially the UK variant, B1.1.7 - account for more than two-thirds of infections in Ontario. \nEven with vaccinations progressing, the expert panel warned that the number of new cases in Ontario could go as high as 30,000 a day - in a province with 14 million people, 38% of the total population of Canada. \nOn Friday, Ontario reported 4,812 new cases, its third straight day of setting new records since the pandemic began. \nHospital admissions and the number of patients in intensive care also set records for Ontario: 1,955 and 701, respectively. \nThe expert panel said the best-case scenario would bring new cases down to about 5,000 a day, but only with considerably more stringent public health measures than the ones now in place. \nIt would also require a vaccination rate of 300,000 a day - three times the current pace. \nLast week the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario warned doctors that they might have to start making decisions about who to admit to intensive care, because units were stretched almost to capacity. \nThe co-chairman of Ontario's expert panel, Adalsteinn Brown, said Ontario's hospitals could no longer function normally. \n\"Our children's hospitals are admitting adults. This has never happened in Ontario before. It's never happened in Canada before.\"\nA field hospital is now being set up in the car park of one of Toronto's main hospitals. \nAfter a slow start, the pace of vaccination is now picking up. Canada was quick to buy up stocks of vaccine doses, but until recently the rollout was lagging behind other industrialised countries. \nNine million Canadians have now received at least one vaccine dose. \nThere was mixed news on Friday. Moderna said it would cut its next shipment to Canada by almost half, to 650,000 doses, but Pfizer is to supply an additional eight million doses after it reached a new deal with the Canadian government. \nUnlike some European countries, Canada has not withdrawn the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, but is advising its use only in patients over 55 while the risk from blood clots is assessed. Canadian health officials say the risk from catching Covid-19 far outweighs the risk of rare blood clots. \nThe Canadian Medical Association (CMA) has called for a national response, sharing resources across provincial and territorial boundaries to deliver to the areas most in need.

      "tags": "Breonna Taylor death,US police killings,US race relations,George Floyd death",
      "text": "Here's a timeline of major incidents since 2014 involving police officers which resulted in the deaths of black Americans.\nEric Garner died after he was wrestled to the ground by a New York police officer on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes.\nWhile in a choke hold, Mr Garner uttered the words \"I can't breathe\" 11 times. \nThe incident - filmed by a bystander - led to protests across the country. The police officer involved was later fired, but was never prosecuted.\nIt came a year after the Black Lives Matter movement emerged in response to the acquittal of the man who killed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.\nMichael Brown, 18, was killed by a police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri, who was responding to reports that Brown had stolen a box of cigars. \nThe officer, Darren Wilson, stopped his car in front of Brown.\nBrown reached into the car and punched Wilson, and in the struggle that followed, he tried to grab the police officer's gun, according to a report by the Department of Justice (DOJ), which was based on forensic evidence and interviews with dozens of witnesses. \nOne shot was fired and Brown ran off, pursued by Wilson. When he turned back and moved towards Wilson, the fatal shots were fired, according to witnesses.\nAlthough the police officer was cleared of wrongdoing, the DOJ report was scathing about systemic problems in the Ferguson police and racial disparities in the justice system.\nThe incident led to multiple waves of protests and civil unrest in Ferguson, boosting the Black Lives Matter movement further.\nTamir Rice, a boy of 12, was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio by a police officer after reports of a male who was \"probably a juvenile\" pointing a gun that was \"probably fake\" at passers by. \nPolice claimed that they told Rice to drop the weapon - but instead of dropping it he pointed it at police. \nThe police confirmed that the gun was a toy after Rice had been shot dead. \nThe police officer who fired the fatal shots was sacked three years later for lying on his job application form.\nIn December 2020, the Justice Department said it was closing its investigation into the case as there was not enough evidence to bring federal criminal charges.\nWalter Scott was shot in the back five times by a white police officer, who was later fired and eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison. \nMr Scott had been pulled over for having a defective light on his car in North Charleston, South Carolina, and ran away from the police officer after a brief scuffle.\nThe killing sparked protests in North Charleston, with chants of \"No justice, no peace\".\nAlton Sterling's death led to days of protests in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr Sterling was killed after police responded to reports of a disturbance outside a shop.\nThe incident was caught on mobile phone footage and spread online.\nThe two officers involved did not face criminal charges, but one was dismissed and the other suspended from the police.\nPhilando Castile was killed while out driving with his girlfriend in St Paul, Minnesota.\nHe was pulled over by the police during a routine check, and told them he was licensed to carry a weapon, and had one in his possession.\nHe was shot as he was reaching for his licence, according to his girlfriend. \nShe live-streamed the encounter on Facebook. The officer involved was cleared of murder charges.\nStephon Clark died after being shot at least seven times in his grandmother's backyard in Sacramento, California, by police who were investigating a nearby break-in.\nOnly a mobile phone was found at the scene, and Mr Clark was unarmed.\nThe release of a police video of the incident sparked major protests in the city.\nIn March 2019, the authorities announced that the two officers involved would not face criminal prosecution as the officers had feared for their lives, believing Mr Clark had a gun.\nBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was shot eight times when officers raided her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky.\nLouisville police said they returned fire after one officer was shot at and wounded.  \nBreonna Taylor's family filed a lawsuit, and in September 2020 reached a settlement of $12m (\u00a39.4m) with the city authorities.\nThe lawsuit stated that Ms Taylor's partner - who was with her at the time -  had fired in self-defence because the police did not identify themselves, and he thought the apartment was being burgled.\nA grand jury charged one police officer not with Ms Taylor's death, but with \"wanton endangerment\" for firing into a neighbouring apartment.\nThree officers involved in the raid have now been dismissed from the police force.\nGeorge Floyd died after being arrested in Minneapolis and held down by police officers, one of whom had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.\nHe pleaded that he couldn't breathe, and after his death, protests broke out across the US, and there were demonstrations in other parts of the world.\nFormer police officer Derek Chauvin - who had knelt on Mr Floyd - was convicted on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter after a three-week trial.\nThree other officers who were involved in the incident will be tried later this year accused of aiding and abetting Mr Chauvin.\nDaunte Wright was shot and killed in Brooklyn Center, just north of Minneapolis.\nAfter being pulled over for a traffic violation, the police told Mr Wright he was being arrested for an outstanding  warrant. \nHe broke free and tried to re-enter his car, at which point an officer is heard shouting \"Taser\" several times before firing a shot.\nLocal police said the killing appeared to be accidental, and the officer, Kim Potter, had meant to use her Taser and not her handgun.\nThe family has rejected that explanation, and protests over the shooting have continued.\nMrs Potter has resigned from the police, and been charged with second-degree manslaughter."

      "tags": "Companies,Ocado,Driverless cars,Retailing",
      "text": "Online grocery retailer Ocado has unveiled a major push into autonomous driving technology.\nIt has teamed up with another British company, Oxbotica, to build self-driving vehicles for itself and others who use its platform.\nThat could include automatic forklift trucks at warehouses, self-driving delivery vans, or even \"kerb to kitchen\" robots for the final leg.\nAs part of the deal, Ocado has bought a \u00a310m stake in Oxbotica.\nTogether, they say they plan to build hardware and software for autonomous vehicles. \n\"We want the entire end to end operation, ultimately, to be autonomous - from the receipt of stock to the warehouse all the way through to the customer's door,\" said Alex Harvey, Ocado's head of advanced technology.\n\"From a customer's perspective you open your door and outside you will see an autonomous van or another autonomous vehicle pull up outside your house, and most likely an autonomous robot will get out of that autonomous vehicle, will collect your groceries, and hand them to you at the doorstep.\" \nIn recent years, Ocado has tried to project itself as a technology platform to be used by global retailers, rather than just an online grocery store. \nIt has developed robots which now pick and pack groceries at its state-of-the-art fulfilment centres, and this week, America's Kroger supermarket chain unveiled its first warehouse using the Ocado technology.\nKroger's delivery vans also use software developed by Ocado to plot the most efficient routes. \nThe new partnership with Oxbotica will aim to take this idea further. \nOxbotica builds autonomous driving software for a range of global clients. The company was founded in 2014 by two Oxford professors - Paul Newman and Ingmar Posner - whose university research focused on self-driving cars.\nThe startup company has just raised new funding from investors in the UK, US and China. Ocado's \u00a310m stake is part of that funding round, and will give it a seat on Oxbotica's board.\nIn its announcement, Ocado tempered expectations and said that getting permission from regulators to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads - allowing driverless deliveries to customers' homes - may take some time.\nBut it said that \"last-mile\" deliveries to customers' homes are a significant part of an online retailer's costs, with labour accounting for half of that - so autonomous vans could produce big savings.\nIn the short term, it sees vehicles operating in restricted areas such as its own warehouses, with the first prototypes coming within two years.\nOcado executives hate it when you call it an online grocer. The company wants to be seen as a technology platform for the world's retailers. This partnership with another British business, the scrappy autonomous software startup Oxbotica, is meant to signal the scale of its ambitions.\nFor Oxbotica's Paul Newman, it's an exciting opportunity for two UK companies to become a global force in technology which has been dominated by American and Chinese players - \"we've got a global vision, we're going to change the way goods are moved,\" he told me this morning.\nAnd Ocado's technology boss Alex Harvey points out that the company has already acquired two American tech businesses this year.\n\"It's normally the other way around... I think it represents a very exciting opportunity to be able to leverage the best of British between Oxbotica and Ocado and export it to the rest of the world.\"\nRemember - big dreams about the progress towards self-driving vehicles on public roads have come up against the reality that the technological and regulatory hurdles to be cleared are very challenging, \nEveryone from the former Chancellor Philip Hammond to Oxbotica's own Paul Newman predicted self-driving cars and vans should be on UK streets by now.\nProf Newman, who started his driverless car research as an Oxford University academic, admits that was a little optimistic. But he says now, the time is right: \"This is a sensible proposition that makes economic sense.\"\nBut sceptics will wonder how motorists will feel about sharing the roads with driverless vans, let alone what customers will think about a robot telling you that the avocados are out of stock and you're getting oranges instead."

      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock owns shares in a company which was approved as a potential supplier for NHS trusts in England, it has emerged.\nIn March, he declared he had acquired more than 15% of Topwood Ltd, which was granted the approved status in 2019.\nThe firm, which specialises in the secure storage, shredding and scanning of documents, also won \u00a3300,000 of business from NHS Wales this year.\nA government spokesman said there had been no conflict of interest.\nHe also said the health secretary had acted \"entirely properly\". \nBut Labour said there was \"cronyism at the heart of this government\" and the party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has asked the head of the civil service to investigate whether Mr Hancock breached the ministerial code.\nIn March this year, Mr Hancock declared in the MPs' register of interests that he had acquired more than 15% of the shares in Topwood, under a \"delegated management arrangement\".\nPublic contract records show that the company was awarded a place in the Shared Business Services framework as a potential supplier for NHS local trusts in 2019, the year after Mr Hancock became health secretary.\nThe MPs' register did not mention that his sister Emily Gilruth - involved in the firm since its foundation in 2002 - owns a larger portion of the shares and is a director, or that Topwood has links to the NHS - as first reported by the Guido Fawkes blog and Health Service Journal.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Matt Hancock has to answer the questions... He can't pretend that the responsibility lies elsewhere.\"\nBut he said he was \"not suggesting\" the health secretary had broken any rules.\nThe SNP's deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, said \"Tory cronyism\" was \"rife within Westminster\".\nBut a government spokesperson said: \"Mr Hancock has acted entirely properly in these circumstances. All declarations of interest have been made in accordance with the ministerial code. Ministers have no involvement in the awarding of these contracts, and no conflict of interest arises.\"\nA Department of Health source said Mr Hancock had discussed the fact he was to be gifted shares in the firm with civil servants before he accepted them.\nThey ruled that if any conflicts of interest were to arise, they could be handled in line with the ministerial code, the rulebook setting out the standards of conduct for ministers.\nThis states that ministers should declare interests of close family if they believe they might give rise to a conflict. \nWhen he was secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport in 2017, he did declare that his brother Chris Hancock was chief executive of an investment crowdfunding company called Crowd2Fund.\nThe Department of Health said Mr Hancock had no active role in running Topwood.\nAs health secretary for England, he does not have responsibility for NHS Wales, which awarded contracts to Topwood earlier this year.\nMr Hancock has not yet commented."

      "text": "Tickets for arena shows by Alicia Keys, Haim and Mrs Brown's Boys in June are still on sale despite the fact they can't go ahead as planned under the government reopening roadmap.\nIn February, the government said full-capacity indoor events would not return in England until at least 21 June.\nBut on Friday, tickets remained on sale to see Keys, Haim, Mrs Brown's Boys and more stars on tour before that date.\nFans can only get refunds if shows are officially rescheduled or cancelled.\nKeys is scheduled to play in Manchester, London and Birmingham from 6-10 June - dates that have already been rescheduled once. Her spokeswoman confirmed the tour will not happen this June.\nThe English leg of the Mrs Brown's Boys comedy tour is scheduled to start in Hull on 7 June. A spokeswoman said they are likely to announce new plans next week. Meanwhile, US trio Haim are due to play in Manchester, London and Nottingham from 15 June.\nAny such shows are not expected to go ahead with smaller, socially-distanced crowds, which could be allowed from 17 May.\nHaim fan Kat Hakin has paid \u00a395 for two tickets to see the band at the O2 Arena. \"The biggest problem is they're still selling tickets for a date that they know that's not going to happen,\" she said.\nMs Hakin said her ticket app it is still showing the tickets as being valid for 18 June. \"There's no indication there that it's not going to happen,\" she said.\n\"I'm frustrated at not being able to make my plans. I don't expect the concert to go ahead on the 18th at all, but I'm not about to make other plans, just in case. I've got to travel and get accommodation for that date, so I don't want to be doing that at last minute, should Boris [Johnson] bring the opening date forward, which I really can't see.\"\nJulian Knight MP, chair of the House of Commons culture select committee, said it was \"concerning\" that tickets were still on sale for events that would not take place as planned.\n\"People who've already bought tickets should be able to get a refund, there is no reason for concerts organisers to hang on their cash,\" he said. \"The 'not before' roadmap date of 21 June has given the industry the clarity it was waiting for - now is the time for the industry to do the responsible thing.\"\nAdam French, senior consumer rights editor at Which?, said: \"These events should be taken off sale.\n\"Consumers should also be advised not to buy tickets until new dates are confirmed, otherwise they could lose out on the cost of booking fees in any refund they are due if they cannot make the new dates.\"\nTicket sites and venues must wait for promoters to instruct them to move or remove shows from their listings. \nPromoters Live Nation said on Thursday that announcements about shows scheduled for before 21 June involving Keys, Haim and more were \"imminent\".\nFellow promoters SJM said: \"The planned dates for Mrs Browns Boys will not be able to happen this summer as a result of the ongoing restrictions related to the global pandemic.

All customers should hold on to their tickets and as soon as new dates are confirmed we will let them know and the dates will be publicised.\"\nA spokeswoman for the O2 Arena said they were waiting to hear from Live Nation and SJM. A spokeswoman for Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena, where Haim are due to play on 19 June, said they were \"awaiting information from the promoter\".\nA message on the website of Manchester's AO Arena, which is due to host Keys' first UK date, said the venue was \"continuing to liaise with promoters and event organisers of all shows that are scheduled to take place before the 21 June 2021, expecting more changes to the events calendar\".\nThe Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London, where Mrs Brown's Boys are scheduled to appear on 11 and 12 June, said it was \"waiting on confirmation from the event promoters on when this event is postponing to\" and that \"the event will not be socially distanced, it would have to postpone to a date where it can take place at full capacity\".\nA spokesman for Blackpool Opera House, where Mrs Brown's Boys are in the diary from 14-16 June, said they were \"awaiting an update from the show's promoters\".\nTrade associations UK Music, Live and the Concert Promoters' Association declined to comment."

      "tags": "Hong Kong anti-government protests,China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been sentenced to 14 months in prison after being found guilty of unauthorised assembly.\nMr Lai, 73, was one of several activists in court who were earlier found guilty of charges relating to pro-democracy protests in 2019.\nThe founder of the Apple Daily tabloid is a fierce critic of Beijing. \nFriday's verdict comes as the mainland is increasingly cracking down on Hong Kong's rights and freedoms.\nSeveral other activists were sentenced on Friday for participating in two demonstrations, on 18 August and 31 August 2019. \nThey include veteran campaigner Martin Lee, 82, and lawyer Margaret Ng, 73, whose sentences were suspended.\nEarlier this week, Mr Lai's Apple Daily newspaper published a handwritten letter by him, sent from prison, which read: \"It is our responsibility as journalists to seek justice. As long as we are not blinded by unjust temptations, as long as we do not let evil get its way through us, we are fulfilling our responsibility.\"\nMr Lai was sentenced to 12 months for the 18 August demonstration and another eight months for 31 August. However, the judge ordered for the sentences to be served concurrently except for two months.  Former lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan was also jailed for both demonstrations.\nThe tycoon faces another six charges - two of which were imposed under the country's new National Security Law, which can carry a maximum term of life in prison. It is possible that prosecutors could file further charges against him.\nThe law, implemented in Hong Kong by China last year, criminalises secession and subversion. Earlier this month, Beijing overhauled the territory's electoral rules to ensure more loyalty to the mainland.\nBy Grace Tsoi, BBC News, Hong Kong\nSome of the most long-standing and well-known activists were in the dock today. Except Jimmy Lai, all of them were elected legislators. \nAt 82, Martin Lee was the oldest defendant. Often called as the \"father of democracy\" in Hong Kong, he is also the most senior barrister in the city. \nThe court was filled with their families, friends and supporters. Before the hearing started, some in the audience stood up, waved to the defendants and gave them a thumbs-up. \nJimmy Lai appeared to be calm during sentencing, even though he had been charged with two additional charges earlier today. \nBut one of the most striking parts of the hearing came in the speech delivered by Margaret Ng, a barrister who served as a lawmaker representing the legal profession for nearly two decades, after discharging her lawyer during mitigation. \nAdapting a quote from Thomas More who was executed by King Henry VIII, she said: \"I stand the law's good servant but the people's first. For the law must serve the people, not the people the law.\" \nThere was a round of applause from the audience after her speech. \nDuring sentencing, the judge said: \"Actions have consequences for everyone irrespective of who they are.\" \nFive of the defendants have to be sent to jail as they didn't get suspended sentences. When they left the dock, many in the audience waved and cried out, \"Stay strong!\"\nThe sentencing is part of a series of trials all relating to the large-scale pro-democracy protests two years ago. \nIn 2019, protests culminated in the most tense wave of demonstrations in years, often ending in widespread violence between police and activists. \nThe pro-democracy campaigners were already found guilty of unauthorised assembly earlier this month. \nTheir defence team had argued that freedom of assembly is protected under Hong Kong's constitution, and that authorities had approved a demonstration which only then grew into the unauthorised march. \nThe prosecution argued that freedom of assembly - while granted in the constitution - was not absolute in Hong Kong.\nFor 18 August\nJimmy Lai - 12 months\nLee Cheuk-yan - 12 months\nLeung Kwok-hung - 18 months\nAu Nok-hin - 10 months\nCyd Ho - 8 months\nMartin Lee - 11 months, suspended\nAlbert Ho - one year, suspended\nMargaret Ng - one year, suspended\nLeung Yiu-chung - 8 months, suspended\nFor 31 August\nJimmy Lai - additional 2 months\nLee Cheuk-yan - additional 2 months\nYeung Sum - 8 months, suspended\nsource: South China Morning Post\nMr Lai is one of the most prominent supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement - and faces separate charges under Beijing's national security law. \nEstimated to be worth more than $1bn (\u00a3766m), he made his initial fortune in the clothing industry and later ventured into media and founded Next Digital.\nNext Digital publishes Apple Daily, a well-read tabloid which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership.\nIn a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Mr Lai has been a persistent thorn for China - both through his publications and writing.\nIt has seen him become a hero for many residents in Hong Kong but on the mainland he is viewed as a traitor who threatens Chinese national security.\nInterviewed by the BBC before his arrest, he said he would not give in to intimidation. \n\"If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it. The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you.\" \nMartin Lee, the veteran of Hong Kong's struggle for more political rights, is the founding chairman of the Democratic Party. \nKnown as the father of Hong Kong democracy, he said in 2020 he was \"very much relieved\" by his arrest.\n\"For so many years, so many months, so many good youngsters were arrested and charged, while I was not arrested. I feel sorry about it,\" he added.\nMany of the others had been at the heart of the pro-democracy struggle for years dating back to the Umbrella Movement in 2014 and even further.\nLeung Kwok-hung, known as \"Long Hair\", was a member of the city's parliament, the Legislative Council (LegCo) and even once tried to run as chief executive, the territory's highest office.\nMargaret Ng was a key figure in the Civic Party, another opposition group pitted against Beijing's rising influence and also served several years in LegCo.\nBritain handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the Basic Law was created under the handover agreement under the \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThis is supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.\nBut fears that this model was being eroded led to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019.\nSome protests turned violent and in 2020, China introduced a controversial national security law in the territory, criminalising secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces with the maximum sentence life in prison.\nBeijing said the law would target \"sedition\" and bring stability. Since the law has been enacted in June, around 100 people have been arrested, including Mr Lai. "

I'd only just taken it over a year last June, so I'd only really just got my numbers up. I feel like I'm starting from scratch again.\"\nShe said she was particularly worried for those new mothers who could have post-natal depression and how they can be coaxed back when lockdown restrictions were finally lifted.\n\"Those mums that are going to join us will be the confident ones who are ready to come out into the big wide world. I'm worried about the ones who are feeling apprehensive.\n\"It's hard enough coming out with a new baby, but having being locked in for so long, I think there are a lot of anxious mums and dads out there.\n\"That's the thing we have got to deal with now - how to reach them.\"\nSarah Jones is one of those mothers who took her first child to sensory play sessions around Bridgend, but has also experienced post-natal mental health challenges with her second child Sullivan, who was born in lockdown 10 months ago.\n\"It's been really, really tough,\" she said.\n\"The mummy friends and the support you get from those groups is incredible. To not have that this time around, it has been so isolating and so difficult.\n\"I think the biggest thing with the classes and baby groups is support.\n\"As much as the baby gets out of it, I think the parents get just as much or even more. You do rely on that mummy support.\"\nThe professional photographer said it also meant \"mummy guilt\" had become an issue for many.\n\"My little one has never been swimming, he's never been to a soft-play area, and even days out have been limited - so many places are just closed.\n\"I feel guilty Sullivan hasn't experienced what my other child has had.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has said the restrictions on children's indoor activities could be lifted on 17 May, providing cases of Covid remain low."

      "text": "Three gang members have been convicted of murdering a man who was stabbed \"at random\" in front of a terrified child.\nJoshua White, 29, was found with fatal injuries in Hackney, east London, on 26 April 2019.\nTaylar Isaac, 20, and David Kerrigan, also 20, were found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey. Theo Momodu, 18, had previously admitted the same charge.\nThey carried out the attack after Momodu was told by a senior gang member to get some \"notches on your blade\".\nThe three men were also convicted of trying to murder another man, Rikkardo Butler, that same day.  \nDuring the trial, jurors heard that as Mr White fled from the masked attackers, he sent a young girl on roller-skates flying. CCTV footage showed him trying to check on her.\nThe court was told the defendants carried out the \"carefully thought-through expedition\" after Momodu received a text message from a gang leader saying that young gang members should \"get someone down\" or face being \"de-recruited\".\nThe defendants will be sentenced on 23 April.\nDet Sgt Andy Sheppard, from the Met Police, said the three men went out that day with the \"clear intention to stab people\", adding that they did not \"care who, as long as it earned them respect and notoriety in their gang\".\nHe added: \"Joshua appears to have been targeted at random. \n\"He was chased in broad daylight and savagely stabbed just yards from an innocent six-year-old girl.\"\nIn a statement, Mr White's mother Trisha Sargusingh described her son as \"kind, loving, happy, caring, a loyal friend and a sensitive and humble man\".\nShe said: \"His passing has left a hole in my heart that will never be filled. \n\"From the time of his senseless murder we, as a family, have been mourning not only for him but for the loss of all the experiences, hopes and dreams that he will never now fulfil.\"\nAfter Mr White knocked over the young girl as he was being chased, he sought to reassure her before trying to take refuge inside a shop.\nThe jury heard how Momodu and Isaac closed in on him in a pincer movement with Kerrigan close behind - all three were members of a gang called Stokey16.\nMomodu then stabbed Mr White three times in the back with a 2ft-long red-tinted Zombie sword, before Isaac delivered a fatal wound to the chest with a large knife, the Old Bailey was told.\nAll three men fled the scene in a car as Mr White - who was about to start a job as a train driver - collapsed inside the shop.\nMinutes later, the trio targeted Mr Butler, who was attacked as he walked with his partner, pushing a baby in a pram.\nHe ran away, having received superficial stab wounds, the court heard.\nMomodu was soon arrested by police, while Isaac and Kerrigan went to the Hackney home of Harley McGivern, where they changed clothes. \nMcGivern, 20, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice.\nMr White's father Leigh said: \"Joshua's life was cut short in such a meaningless and senseless killing. I hope that those responsible recognise the deep psychological and emotional damage that this has inflicted on everyone who knew him.\n\"Life without him will never be the same again.\""

      "text": "A former senior civil servant embroiled in a row over his job at Greensill Capital took another post without reporting it, it has emerged.\nBill Crothers has come under fire for working at the now-failed finance firm while still on the government payroll.\nIt has now come to light he took on another trustee role without seeking the advice of the necessary committee.\nMr Crothers apologised to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments for what he called an \"honest mistake\".\nBut the chair of the committee, Lord Eric Pickles, said he had breached government rules.\nThe news comes after Lord Pickles warned the existing guidelines on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms needed urgent reforms as there did not appear to be \"any boundaries at all\" between civil servants and the private sector.\nLabour says things are becoming \"murkier\" and lobbyists have an \"open door\" to government. \nThe government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers after the row over Greensill Capital, access, influence and lobbying has engulfed Westminster.\nThe review will include former prime minister David Cameron's dealing with the firm, as well as Mr Crothers.\nIt will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. \nA number of Commons Select Committees have also announced their own inquiries. \nOn Wednesday, Mr Johnson ordered Conservative MPs to vote down Labour's call for a \"full\" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely.\nIt emerged on Tuesday that Mr Crothers - a former government procurement officer - joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant, after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. \nBut an exchange of letters between him and Lord Pickles, published on Thursday, also revealed he had failed to alert the committee about a different job he took in 2016 as a trustee with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply\nMr Crothers apologised in his letter for what he described an \"honest mistake\", saying he did not think he had to report the role as it was unpaid and with a not-for-profit charity.\nBut Lord Pickles said the rules applied to both paid and unpaid jobs and it was therefore a breach of the regulations.\nEarlier, the Tory peer Lord Pickles told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but the Greensill lobbying affair was \"not where I expected it to come from\".\nHe added: \"There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage.\n\"Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort. But where it becomes wrong is where it is not properly regulated and is transparent.\"\nSpeaking about Mr Crothers, Lord Pickles said it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise.\nBut he said the former civil servant's \"excuse\" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him.\n\"It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse,\" he said.\nHe said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work.\nLord Pickles also expressed his frustration that his committee had a \"very limited and defined role\", but added that most people do follow the rules and it is \"only a tiny minority\" who cause problems.\nSpeaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. \nThe PM said: \"I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say.\n\"We need to understand what's gone on here.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said more and stronger lobbying rules are needed because the current system \"is not working\".\nHe said ministers were being lobbied for \"massive\" procurement contracts \"involving millions sometimes billions of pounds\". \nHe added: \"Increasingly we're seeing a murkier and murkier picture whether it's the way contracts are handed out, the lack of due process or the lobbying which is not a revolving door, it's an open door now in to government\".

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The ex-officer accused of killing George Floyd says he will not testify on his own behalf as the defence rests their case and court is adjourned.\nDerek Chauvin denies killing Mr Floyd. Jurors are due to begin deliberating his fate on Monday morning.\nVideo of Mr Chauvin kneeling on the neck of Mr Floyd led to worldwide protests against racism and policing.\nTensions in Minneapolis are running high after an unrelated police shooting of a black man in a nearby suburb.\nExperts say it would be unusual for a suspect to take the stand in their own defence during a trial.\nBefore the jury was brought into the courtroom on Thursday, Mr Chauvin was asked a series of questions about his decision not to testify.\nHis defence lawyer, Eric Nelson, began by asking whether he and Mr Chauvin had previously discussed his decision.\n\"Correct,\" Mr Chauvin said several times.\n\"To say we've gone kind of back and forth on the matter is kind of understatement, isn't that right?\" asked Mr Nelson.\n\"Yes it is,\" Mr Chauvin responded, as they both briefly smiled.\n\"I will invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege today,\" Mr Chauvin then told the court, referring to the constitutional right to stay silent in fear of self-incrimination.\nAsked by the judge whether this was his decision alone, and whether anyone else had unfairly influenced his decision, Mr Chauvin responded: \"No promises or threats, your honour.\"\nAfter prosecutors recalled an earlier witness - Dr Martin Tobin, who disputed the notion that Mr Floyd died of carbon monoxide poisoning - the judge adjourned the court until Monday.\nThe defence rested on Thursday, setting the stage for closing arguments from each side to happen on Monday.\nOnce the state and Mr Chauvin's defence have presented their closing arguments, the judge will send the jury into sequestration.\n\"Expect that when you report for duty on Monday that it will be followed by sequestration,\" Judge Peter Cahill told the jury this week. \"So pack your bag.\"\nWhile sequestered, the jury will be kept in a private location - typically a hotel - and must rely on their own memories of the lawyer's arguments and witness testimonies to render their verdict. They are given computers that contain all of the video and audio evidence that has been heard in court.\nThe jury has been only partially sequestered until now.\nThey are allowed to return home every night but are escorted into the courthouse everyday from a secure location. They are forbidden from reading media reports about the case, and every move they make inside the courthouse is watched by a bailiff.\nOn Monday, Mr Chauvin's lawyer argued that unrest over the shooting of Duante Wright in the nearby suburb of Brooklyn Center just 10 miles (16km) from the courthouse should trigger full sequestration during the final week of arguments.\nBut the judge disagreed, saying \"this is a totally different case\".\nAll 12 jurors must agree to Mr Chauvin's guilt in order for him to be convicted. There are three separate charges that they must consider.\nWith the manslaughter charge, prosecutors do not need prove he actually caused Mr Floyd's death. Someone found guilty of this charge may be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail.\nIt's unknown how long jury deliberation may last. Experts say it could be brief - as little as one hour - or it could take weeks.\nJudge Cahill has said that if verdict comes late in the day, the result will be announced the following morning.\nFourteen jurors have sat in the courtroom over the past three weeks. They are never shown on camera and must remain anonymous for their own safety and privacy.\nSelecting them was no easy feat due to the high-profile nature of the case. Over 11 days of jury summons, lawyers for both sides settled on a panel that skews younger, more white and more female.\nIt also includes a black grandmother in her 60s who once lived a few blocks from where Mr Floyd died.\nAnother juror, a white woman in her 50s, worked at a suburban business damaged last summer after Mr Floyd's death.\nAnd a black man in his 40s was added to the jury after he agreed that minorities are mistreated by the police, but police departments should not under any circumstances be defunded.\nAt least one of them lives in Brooklyn Center, the suburb that has seen police deploy tear gas after protesters took to the streets following the death of Mr Wright, who was allegedly shot after the officer mistook her gun for her Taser.\nWhat questions do you have about the Derek Chauvin trial?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Chemistry,Effects of global warming,Materials science",
      "text": "Scientists in the US have developed a paint significantly \"whiter than the whitest paint currently available\". \nTests carried out by researchers at Purdue University on their \"ultra-white\" paint showed it reflected more than 98% of sunlight. \nThat suggests, the scientists say, that it could help save energy and fight climate change. \nPainting \"cool roofs\" white is an energy-saving approach already being rolled out in some major cities.\nCommercially available white paints reflect between 80% and 90% of sunlight, according to lead researcher Prof Xiulin Ruan from Purdue, in West Lafayette, Indiana. \"It's a big deal, because every 1% of reflectance you get translates to 10 watts per metre squared less heat from the Sun,\" he explained. \n\"So if you were to use our paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 sq ft  (93 sq m), we estimate you could get a cooling power of 10 kilowatts. That's more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses,\" he said. \n\"Cool\" white roofs are seen as an easy, urban climate solution. \nIn the US, New York has recently coated more than 10 million sq ft of rooftops white. The state of California has already updated building codes to promote cool roofs. \nTheir benefits are still being investigated, but studies have shown they can reduce energy demands and create lower ambient temperatures. That has the added benefit of reducing the amount of water used for irrigation in cities. \n\"We did a very rough calculation,\" said Prof Ruan. \"And we estimate we would only need to paint 1% of the Earth's surface with this paint - perhaps an area where no people live that is covered in rocks - and that could help fight the climate change trend.\"\nThe new paint contains a compound called barium sulfate, which is also used to make photo paper and cosmetics.\n\"We used a very high concentration of the compound particles,\" explained Prof Ruan. \"And we use lots of different sizes of particles, because sunlight has different colours at the different wavelength.\"\nHow much each particle scatters light depends on its size, \"so we deliberately used different particle sizes to scatter each wavelength\".\nThe researchers are now working with a company to produce and sell their paint, which they say should be similar in cost to currently available paints. \n\"I already had an inquiry from a museum that wants to put up a display of our whitest white paint side by side with the blackest black,\" said Prof Ruan.  \nThat ultra-black coating is a material scientists developed in 2014, called Vantablack. \nIt absorbs almost all light, so its potential uses are almost the opposite of the \"ultra-white\" paint. Vantablack, used in space telescopes, for example, could absorb stray light that might interfere with their ability to measure light from objects in deep space.     \nBut Vantablack, which is a coating of nanoscale carbon tubes, is not available to everyone. Its invention led to an artistic controversy when sculptor and former Turner prize-winning artist, Anish Kapoor, bought the exclusive rights to its \"use as an art material\". \nIn response, UK-based artist Stuart Semple created a pigment that he claimed to be the world's \"pinkest pink\" and made it available to purchase on his website for \"everyone but Anish Kapoor\".\nVantablack's developers, a company called Surrey NanoSystems, said the exclusivity deal with Mr Kapoor would not preclude the whitest white being displayed alongside the blackest black in a museum. \"That isn't art; we would see it as an educational display for people interested in the science and technology behind extremes of light and darkness,\" the company told BBC News. \nProf Ruan added that it would be up to the company that produces the \"ultra-white\" paint, but he hoped it would be available to everyone.\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "Hammerson, owner of Birmingham's Bullring, is to cut rents for its retail tenants by 30% as it aims to recover from a year of lockdowns.\nThe firm's UK boss Mark Bourgeois said it had been a \"challenging\" period when it had tried to \"share the pain\" with retailers forced to shut.\nNon-essential shops in England and Wales reopened on Monday.\nHammerson said footfall had been stronger than the week after the first lockdown ended in June.\nOver the past year, Hammerson, which also owns London's Brent Cross, collected about 75% of rents owed by its tenants and agreed abatements with those shops who needed it.\nHowever, it expects to continue helping the retailers in its shopping centres which also include The Oracle site in Reading and the Victoria Quarter in Leeds.\n\"Typically, we're resetting our rents to more affordable levels,\" Mr Bourgeois told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"We reckon across the board and our business we'll probably reduce rents from their peak by about 30% so we are really doing our bit as are... all landlords to make sure we maintain vibrancy in these centres.\"\nMr Bourgeois said that the bounce back in footfall in the past week had been more pronounced than equivalent period last June.\nHe said that the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out has made shoppers \"feel safer\", adding it was likely there was \"more cash in people's pockets and they are feeling perhaps more confident to go and spend\". \nThe Bank of England estimates that UK households have amassed \u00a3125bn in pent-up savings during the pandemic.\nBut Mr Bourgeois also said: \"People just love to get out. You can only do so much online shopping [people want to] get out and feel the products and brands in real life.\" \nOver its last financial year, for the 12 months to 31 December, Hammerson reported a record \u00a31.7bn loss.\nHowever, even before the coronavirus pandemic forced the closure of large parts of the economy, retailers and their landlords were struggling as more consumers chose to shop online.\nLast June, Intu, the heavily-indebted owned of Manchester's Trafford Centre, was forced to file for administration.\nMr Bourgeois said: \"Retail has always been about winners and losers and that's been really accelerated during Covid.\"\nHe said Hammerson was now working to \"repurpose\" space left by the likes of department store Debenhams, which closed all its high street stores after falling into administration and selling the brand to online fashion firm Boohoo.\n\"We have a planning application in Leicester for instance where we are preparing to demolish a Debenhams store and put 300 flats there,\" said Mr Bourgeois. \"So we're bringing homes right into the heart of the city.\""

      "text": "Successful vaccine programmes will prevent another washout for summer holidaymakers, the boss of Europe's largest tour company has told the BBC.\n\"We are optimistic about the summer,\" said Friedrich Joussen, who runs TUI.\nThe firm - which owns a fleet of aircraft, cruise ships and a chain of travel agencies - said bookings in March alone had hit 2.8 million.\nAs a result, it expected to operate up to 75% of its normal schedule for the summer season. \n\"We are still confident that we will have a decent summer,\" said Mr Joussen, pointing to coronavirus vaccination programmes in the UK, US and Europe.\nThe company, which sells holidays to 180 different countries, suffered heavy losses during the pandemic.\nAcross the industry, income slumped by almost $4.5 trillion last year, leaving more than 62 million people without work, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\nThe industry body is pressing for international travel to resume in June to stem further job losses.\nBut Mr Joussen said he expected some countries to ask travellers to prove they had been vaccinated before they were allowed to cross the border. Although he thinks demonstrating a negative test result would be just as effective in preventing the spread of the virus.\nHowever, for that strategy to be successful, he said the cost of those tests should be reduced.\n\"The cheaper it gets, the better it works and the less harmful it is for the general economy,\" he said.\nEuropean countries have ramped up their vaccination programmes in recent weeks, as the continent experiences a third wave of infections in the face of new variants. Nevertheless, Mr Joussen is optimistic about the summer.\n\"All medical advice we are getting as a company says that existing vaccines are working with existing variants,\" Mr Joussen said.\n\"Now they might be less efficient sometimes, but still it's much better than not being vaccinated.\"\nIn the past year, TUI has been forced to borrow billions from the German government just to stay afloat. But analysts have warned that in the wake of the crisis, the part-nationalised firm may struggle to compete against leaner rivals, as the industry reels from more than 12 months of international travel bans.\nMr Joussen said the German state stepped in at a time of great uncertainty, when the firm was struggling to survive and could not raise money from private investors. \n\"Berlin is a very rational investor,\" he said, adding: \"Germany would want to exit the loan as soon as possible.\"\nYou can watch Friedrich Joussen's  full interview on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT, Monday 06: 30 GMT & 10:30 GMT, Tuesday at 12:30 GMT and Thursday at 07:30 GMT."

She said she believed her voice could make a difference.\nJoshua, 17, said he was also nervous but added that if people did not use their votes it devalued democracy.\nSixteen-year-old Maham said she was excited to vote for the first time but said she believed young people had not registered because of a lack of information and they may not know they were eligible to vote. \nAfter legal changes the voting age was lowered in time for the Senedd election, allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote for the first time in an election in Wales.\nThe move follows Scotland - where the voting ages were similarly lowered, enabling votes in the 2014 independence referendum and the 2016 Holyrood election.\nLeaders debate:  If you would like to be part of the virtual audience for the BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders Debate on 29 April, please email us your details to waleslive@bbc.co.uk.\nWhile the exact number of young voters who have not yet registered to vote in Wales is not known, data provided by the ERS shows large differences in numbers who have registered so far depending on where they live.\nOfficial figures show 2,358,070 people in Wales had registered to vote by 2 March - out of an estimated population of about 3.15 million. \nOut of Wales' 22 councils only six provided information on how many 16 to 17-year-olds had registered to vote by 7 April.\nIn Swansea, 1,697 had registered (32.6%), 1,107 had in Neath Port Talbot (35.3%) and 1,138 had in Pembrokeshire (41.3%).\nWhile in Conwy numbers were higher with 1,383 or 57.2% of 16-year-olds registered, in Denbighshire 1,229 (57.7%) and in Vale of Glamorgan it was 1,969 (64.9%).\nThe voter numbers were compared to population age estimates for each of the areas, in 2019, to estimate what percentage of young people had registered to vote.\nMs Blair said the estimates appeared to \"confirm fears that thousands of 16 and 17-year-olds are at risk of not having their say\" on 6 May. \n\"The Senedd elections represent a huge opportunity for young people to make their voices heard on a range of issues that affect their lives including education, health and the economy,\" she said.\n\"The extension of the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds should be a historic moment for Wales, but to make that happen 16 and 17-year-olds need to register and turn out to vote.\"\nIf you are not already registered, you have until 23:59 on 19 April to sign up. You need to visit the government website and fill in the online form. \nYou can apply by post if you prefer.\nIf you are not sure whether you are registered, you can get in touch with your local council's election team.\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.

I've got a mortgage to pay, I've got bills to pay.\n\"There are quite a few families here as well, there are husbands and wives.\n\"Manufacturing is declining and it has been for a few years, so this is a blow - a big blow for the area.\n\"It's not just for us working here, it's for our supply chain too.\"\nThe GMB Union said it was notified by the manufacturing company before Easter that it was considering cutting the workforce and the Welsh government said it was \"working with the company\" to help save jobs.\nMike Payne, the union's senior Wales and South West organiser, has had discussions with Kautext Textron management and said a \"whole site closure\" was being considered because of a \"downturn in sales in the global market\".\n\"It is a profitable site, but Brexit is playing a big part in this,\" he added. \n\"Clients are starting to argue production should be closer to their bases in continental Europe.\n\"It's absolutely devastating for our members at the plant but also for the local economy, the businesses that supply the plant and the Welsh manufacturing industry in general.\"\nHe told BBC Radio Wales the union understood the site could close in 12 to 18 months, and if it could not be saved it would enter redundancy negotiations\nMr Payne added that the union was working with the company and the Welsh government to try and secure a support package to keep the site open.\nGMB said the company was looking at how it could expand into other products, with the potential to then cut just 44 people from the workforce.\nSimon Duval-Smith, former editor of the Automotive Purchasing and Supply Chain magazine, said \"Brexit is a double edged sword\" for Kautex.\nHe told BBC Radio Wales that Brexit required companies to provide more forms and materials to export materials into Europe, which was a cause of the potential closure.\nBut Mr Duval-Smith also said that since leaving the EU \"Wales is now free to offer greater incentives to companies to locate in Wales, and also to stay here\".\nThe Welsh government said it was \"working with the company to explore potential solutions to help sustain the plant\".\n\"This is clearly a concerning time and we are monitoring the situation closely,\" a spokesman added."

Russia says it was not involved.\nIn a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Mr Biden vowed to defend US national interests \"firmly\", while proposing a meeting with Mr Putin to find areas where the two countries could work together.\nOn Thursday, Mr Biden described his decision to impose sanctions on Russia as \"proportionate\". \n\"I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so,\" Mr Biden told reporters. \"The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.\"\nHe added that the way forwards is through \"thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process\". \nA statement from the White House said the new sanctions show the US \"will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia\" if it continues its \"destabilising international action\".\nIt reaffirms the administration's view that the Russian government is behind cyber-attacks and has been trying to \"undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections\" in the US and allied nations.\nIt specifically blames Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for the SolarWinds attack, which gave cyber-criminals potential access to 18,000 government and private computer networks. \nLast December, then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he believed Russia was behind it.\nThe latest sanctions target 32 entities and officials accused of trying to influence the 2020 US presidential election \"and other acts of disinformation\".\nTen diplomats are being expelled. The executive order also bars US financial institutions from purchasing rouble-denominated bonds from June.\nThe Biden administration is trying to tread a careful line. US officials want to impose costs for a range of unacceptable behaviour from Moscow and deter further acts. They also want to signal they are going to take a tougher line than the Trump administration. But they also say they do not want to see a downward spiral in relations. The message they have is that their response is \"resolute but proportionate\".\nThe SolarWinds cyber-espionage campaign was a primary concern. To maximise the impact they have combined response to this with sanctions over election interference and other issues.\nDiplomatic expulsions and sanctions against individuals will largely be shrugged off by Moscow as expected. The financial sanctions regarding Russian sovereign debt are a step-up though.\nThe US has also published a huge amount of detail about Russian intelligence activities ranging from front companies involved in spreading disinformation to Russian tech companies allegedly supporting its intelligence services. \nThe hope will be that this also makes it harder for the Russians to operate. But past experience suggests all of this is unlikely to deter the Kremlin. \nThe White House meanwhile acknowledged there was little evidence to support claims that Russia had offered bounties to Taliban militants for killing American soldiers.\nThe intelligence assessment was first reported last June by the New York Times, and was cited by Mr Biden on the campaign trial last year to accuse then-President Donald Trump of not standing up to Russia. Mr Trump at the time called it \"fake news\".\nOn Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the intelligence community had determined it had only \"low to moderate confidence\" in the claims, which are said to have come from interrogations of Afghan detainees.\nShortly after the sanctions were announced, Russia's foreign ministry called them \"hostile steps which dangerously raise the temperature of confrontation\".\n\"Such aggressive conduct will of course get a decisive response,\" the statement added.  \nThe US ambassador has been called to the foreign ministry.\nThe EU, Nato and the UK have all issued statements in support of the US measures.\nIn his first foreign policy speech in February, Mr Biden vowed to stand up to Russia. \"The days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions\u2026 are over,\" he said.\nThe Obama-Biden administration was accused of standing by while Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. \nBut in recent days Mr Biden has warned the Kremlin against aggressive actions in Ukraine. Russia is beefing up its military presence in the border area.\nMr Biden's predecessor rarely criticised Mr Putin. In a report last month US intelligence agencies concluded the Russian president had probably directed online efforts to help Mr Trump win a second term as US president.\nAnd yet, according to the Carnegie Moscow Center, Mr Trump imposed a record total of more than 40 rounds of sanctions on Moscow. In 2018 he expelled 60 Russian diplomats from the US."

      "text": "China has passed a wide-ranging new security law for Hong Kong which makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces the city's autonomy. \nCritics have called it \"the end of Hong Kong\" - so what do we know, and what do people fear the most? \nHong Kong was always meant to have a security law, but could never pass one because it was so unpopular. So this is about China stepping in to ensure the city has a legal framework to deal with what it sees as serious challenges to its authority. \nThe details of the law's 66 articles were kept secret until after it was passed. It criminalises any act of:\nThe law came into effect at 23:00 local time on 30 June, an hour before the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover to China from British rule.  \nIt gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech - China has said it will return stability.\nThe new law's key provisions include that:\nOnly a handful of people had seen the full text of the law before it was enacted, a source of considerable controversy in Hong Kong. They did not include the territory's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam.\nShe told the UN Human Rights Council hours before it came into force that it would fill a \"gaping hole\" and not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy or its independent judiciary. She also promised it would not be retroactive.\nBeijing has said Hong Kong should respect and protect rights and liberties while safeguarding national security - but many still fear the loss of Hong Kong's freedoms with this law.  \n\"It is clear that the law will have a severe impact on freedom of expression, if not personal security, on the people of Hong Kong,\" Professor Johannes Chan, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, told the BBC before the passage of the law. \nThere are reports of people deleting Facebook posts, and concerns that candidates opposing the national security law will be disqualified from running in elections. \nMany are also afraid Hong Kong's judicial independence will be eroded and its judicial system will look increasingly similar to mainland China's. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China.\n\"Effectively, they are imposing the People's Republic of China's criminal system onto the Hong Kong common law system, leaving them with complete discretion to decide who should fall into which system,\" says Professor Chan.\nSome pro-democracy activists - such as Joshua Wong - have been lobbying foreign governments to help their cause. Such campaigning could become a crime in the future. He has now quit his Demosisto party. \nPeople also worry that a threat to Hong Kong's liberties could affect its attractiveness as a leading global business hub and economic powerhouse.\nHong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThey are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has. \nUnder the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact is own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law - but it never happened because of its unpopularity. \nThen, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.\nChina doesn't want to see that happen again.\nMany might ask how China can do this if the city was supposed to have freedoms guaranteed under the handover agreement. \nThe Basic Law says Chinese laws can't be applied in Hong Kong unless they are listed in a section called Annex III - there are already a few listed there, mostly uncontroversial and around foreign policy. \nThese laws can be introduced by decree - which means they bypass the city's parliament.\nIf you want to find out more about China-Hong Kong tensions read more here:\nCritics say the introduction of the law this way amounts to a breach of the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which is so important to Hong Kong - but clearly it is technically possible to do this.\nReporting by the BBC's Grace Tsoi and Lam Cho Wai "

      "text": "Outdoor hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland will be allowed to open on 30 April. \nNew indicative dates were agreed by ministers on Thursday after a meeting of the executive at Stormont.\nUnlicensed and licensed premises such as restaurants, beer gardens, and cafes can open outdoors earlier than expected, as can gyms.\nIndoor hospitality venues, including pubs and hotels, are then to reopen on 24 May.\nNon-essential retail will reopen from 30 April. \nStormont ministers agreed the dates for the reopening of a number of sectors.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster told a special sitting of the NI Assembly that it was a \"landmark day\".\n\"We must also stress that while we are taking important decisions today, the virus is still with us,\" Mrs Foster said.  \n\"It is still dangerous and we cannot drop our guard.  People are still being infected, hospitals are still receiving patients and unfortunately people are still at risk of serious illness and death.  \n\"So we ask everyone to be mindful.  Step out, but step carefully.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a day of optimism. \n\"The restrictions have been a necessary way to supress the virus, to save lives and protect our health service. But they have taken their toll. And it is incumbent on us to move forward as soon as circumstances allow,\" she said. \n\"But we must do so with caution and have maximum mitigations in place to avoid the virus reclaiming its grip on our society.\"\nNI Retail Consortium director Aodh\u00e1n Connolly said the announcement on the reopening of retail had brought clarity.\nRetail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the announcement was a \"very significant step forward for the reopening of our high streets\".\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said it was \"important to bring optimism and certainty to this improving picture\".\n\"Every one of us has a part to play in maintaining progress - by getting vaccinated when our turn comes and by sticking with the actions that have served us well for the past year - including social distancing, wearing a mask, washing hands. It's also vital to remember that outdoor settings are significantly safer than indoors,\" Mr Swann said. \nMr Swann said on Wednesday that the time was right for the NI Executive to further ease restrictions, after some outdoor retail reopened on Monday.\nIt is understood Northern Ireland's R-number for community transmission is now sitting between 0.9 and 1.4, compared to 0.4 to 0.6 last week. \nThere have been two more Covid-19-related deaths recorded in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours, with a further 159 people testing positive.\nAdvice from health officials states this may be partly due to a \"rebound effect\" after the Easter holidays, the extent of which should become apparent in the next week.\nThe pace of today was surprising. \nWe seemed to have gone from a slow and cautious waltz to a fast moving jive. All along for the last couple of weeks we were told by the health minister and the chief medical officer that it had to be slow and it had to be cautious. \nBut now today the reopening dates came a lot sooner than what we had envisaged, which is good news and can happen, as long as people remain vigilant. \nWe can go to the hairdressers and can go out for a drink and enjoy a coffee in cafes, but officials are concerned about what will happen behind closed doors. \nWe don't have any assurances that there will not be another lockdown. \nThe fear is that as we go into the summer, perhaps we will mostly staycation, but if people travel and come back with another variant, something we don't know of yet, we will perhaps see more people getting sick because the vaccine won't stand the type of variant. \nWhile this is a good day and one we have all been looking forward to, to enjoy the restrictions being lifted in the long term, we are still being advised that we have to be cautious. \nMrs Foster said decisions are aimed at lifting restrictions \"where we can\".  \n\"We cannot do everything people would want.  We are sorry about that and we know it will be disappointing for some,\" she said. \n Ms O'Neill said decisions had been made \"carefully\". \n\"We know that everyone out there is looking for certainty on next steps.  We cannot guarantee every step towards the end of this but we do want to give hope,\" the deputy first minister said. \nProposed dates leaked to the media earlier had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. \nHowever, Economy Minister Diane Dodds had raised concerns via a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises. \nNorthern Ireland took some further gradual steps out of lockdown on Monday, when all pupils returned to school for the first time since Christmas. \nNorthern Ireland was the last part of the UK to lift its stay-at-home rule, which came into effect in January, in a bid to suppress a large rise in cases of coronavirus."

Some historians have argued he was gay or bisexual.\n\"It's such a huge part of who he was\" Turner told Leonardo: The Official Podcast.\n\"And his motivation for doing so much.\"\nThe star agreed with podcast host Angellica Bell that discovering fresh perspectives on the artist's life had also led to him \"looking at his paintings slightly differently\".\n\"There's something almost tortured in some of it,\" he added. \"You can see something else and feel something else, something more visceral about it.\n\"Once you realise the sexuality is such a huge part of any person, you know, to even contemplate not discussing the sexuality of a person is just mind-boggling.\n\"So I'm glad that's something that, even from the early drafts of the scripts... that that was present in our story.\"\nThe drama series, which is a love story and a murder mystery, explores what made Leonardo tick. Each of the eight episodes focuses on a different painting of his and the story behind it.\nIt also features Giancarlo Giannini as his master, Andrea del Verrocchio, and The Undoing star Matilda De Angelis as his muse - Caterina of Cremona.\nLast month however, The Guardian claimed the relationship between the artist and his on-screen female muse rested on \"virtually no historical evidence\". \"Why can't we accept that Da Vinci was gay?\" asked its writer Jonathan Jones.\nThe polymath's sexuality has been widely discussed down the centuries, including by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud in his 1910 essay, Da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood.\nCourt records, found at the start of the 1900s, showed that Leonardo was accused of alleged interaction with a male prostitute. But the case before Florentine magistrates in 1476 was thrown out due to lack of evidence.\nThe Evening Standard said the new series released on 16 April \"plays fast and loose with historical fact - with mixed results\".\n\"We're in a boom time for historical drama that doesn't stick to the rules of the genre - just look at success stories like The Favourite and The Great,\" wrote Katie Rosseinsky.\n\"Perhaps that's why the show's creators decided to shake things up. The end result, though, lacks cohesion - it feels more like a sketch than a masterpiece.\"\nMeanwhile, The Telegraph awarded three stars, describing the show as \"stonkingly chaste Aidan Turner in Horrible Histories minus the laughs\".\nJournalist Ed Power called it \"a quick sketch rather than the fuller portrait one of history's greatest minds surely merits.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Ra\u00fal Castro says he is resigning as Cuban Communist Party leader, ending his family's six decades in power.\nMr Castro, 89, told a party congress that he is handing over the leadership to a younger generation \"full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit\".\nHis successor will be voted in at the end of the four-day congress.\nThe move, which was expected, ends the era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro, which began with the 1959 revolution.\n\"I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots,\" he told party delegates in Havana on Friday. \nAlthough Mr Castro has not endorsed a successor, it is widely believed the party leadership will pass to Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, who took over as the island's president in 2018.\nBy Will Grant, Cuba Correspondent\nWhile the entire island knew this moment was coming, it was no less historic or symbolic when it arrived: Cuba will be officially governed by someone other than a Castro for the first time since 1959. \nThe reality is that, at least in the short term, little will change. \nThe man who took over from Ra\u00fal Castro as president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, may well succeed him now as the party's first secretary too. It seems likely he will be forced to take further steps to liberalise Cuba's centrally controlled economy. The island is currently in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the period immediately following the end of the Cold War. As a result, private farmers were recently permitted to sell beef and dairy products - goods previously under the sole control of the state. \nAny hope of improving ties with the US however may have to wait as the Biden administration has shown little inclination to unpick the Trump administration's harsher sanctions on Cuba at this stage.\nOne thing is for sure, Ra\u00fal Castro's words of keeping \"one foot in the stirrup\" means he will remain a powerbroker behind the scenes. And by reiterating the island's eternal commitment to socialism it means that political change remains as unlikely under his successor as it was under his late brother, Fidel. \nRa\u00fal Castro has been the party's secretary-general since succeeding his older brother, Fidel, in 2011.\nFidel Castro led the revolution that toppled the Cuban government in 1959, when Ra\u00fal served as one of his commanders.\nFidel Castro was the country's leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handed over the presidency to his brother. Fidel Castro died in 2016.\nAs leader, Ra\u00fal Castro maintained the communists' one-party grip on power.\nHe oversaw an improvement in relations with United States between 2014 and 2016, including historic talks with President Barack Obama in 2016.\nBut tensions worsened under Donald Trump, who reinforced sanctions.\nCurrent US President Joe Biden has vowed to relax some of Trump's sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuban policy was not one of his top priorities.\nAt the congress on Friday, Ra\u00fal Castro said his country was willing to \"develop respectful dialogue\" with the United States but it would not accept having to make \"concessions\" regarding its \"foreign policy and ideals\".\nThe change at the top of Cuba's governing party comes as the island's leadership is tackling its most serious economic crisis in decades.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have hit the economy, which shrank by 11% last year.\nA long-awaited currency reform launched on 1 January has sought to make the economy and state companies more efficient. But it has also badly squeezed the budgets of ordinary Cubans.\nMany have been calling for much more economic freedom in the country.\nAnother challenge will be maintaining ideological unity and support in the face of citizens' increased access to the internet and social media.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's visit to India will still go ahead later this month despite the country's soaring coronavirus cases and a new variant there, No 10 says.\nPublic Health England says 73 cases of the variant first identified in India have been found in England and four in Scotland.\nOfficials have called it a \"variant under investigation\" rather than \"of concern\".\nThe PM had already scaled down his trip due to India's rising number of cases.\nThe country has reported more than 150,000 Covid cases a day for the past three weeks.  \nSpeaking about the prime minister's visit to India, a No 10 spokesman said the trip was already \"slightly shorter than it will have been\".\nMr Johnson was due to spend four days in the south Asian country but after talks with Narendra Modi's administration, the \"bulk\" of meetings will take place on one day - Monday, 26 April.\n\"As you would expect, safety is obviously important and is a priority for us on this trip, which is why we will make sure that all elements of the visit are Covid-secure,\" the spokesman said. \nPublic Health England has designated the B.1.617 variant as a \"variant under investigation\" and said there was currently no evidence to suggest it caused more severe disease or that vaccines were less likely to work against it.\nOfficials said \"all appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing\" after its detection, with PHE and international partners monitoring the situation \"closely\".\nBy Philippa Roxby, health reporter, BBC News\nViruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the coronavirus behaves.\nDo they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they cause people to become more seriously ill, and could they evade the protection of vaccines?\nThese are all questions experts will now try to answer about the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data on cases in the real world.\nSo far, we know that it has two mutations - the first, E484Q is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants - and the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California.\nThat means it could be a concern based on what is known about those variants already.\nBut the \"double mutation\" on its own isn't unusual and has been found in other variants.\nCovid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response to the most worrying new variants.\nPaul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the variant first identified in India featured two \"escape mutations\" which \"are causing people to be concerned\".\n\"If you think about where the main variants have arisen - South Africa, the UK, California, Brazil, and now India - all of these are countries that have really struggled to keep case numbers down,\" Prof Hunter said. \n\"So it's not surprising. India has got a huge pandemic, and therefore that's where you're going to be getting the variant.\"\nCoronavirus cases have risen sharply in India in the past few weeks as the country battles a second wave. \nThere have been more than 13.9 million confirmed coronavirus cases in India and 172,000 people have died.\nThe country is not on the UK government's \"red list\" for travel. This refuses entry to people who have been in those countries in the previous 10 days and means a 10-day hotel quarantine for British or Irish nationals, or people with UK residency rights, returning.\nAsked why India had not been put on the red list, Downing Street said the situation was \"under constant review\".\n\"We add and remove countries based on the latest scientific data and public health advice from a range of world-leading experts,\" a spokesman said."

      "tags": "Artemis,Nasa,Human spaceflight,Exploration of the Moon,The Moon",
      "text": "Nasa has chosen Elon Musk's company SpaceX to build a lander that will return humans to the Moon this decade.\nThis vehicle will carry the next man and the first woman down to the lunar surface under the space agency's Artemis programme.\nAnother goal of the programme will be to land the first person of colour on the Moon.\nThe lander is based on SpaceX's Starship craft, which is being tested at a site in southern Texas.\nSpaceX was competing against a joint bid from traditional aerospace giants and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as well as Alabama-based Dynetics. The total value of the contract awarded to Musk's company is $2.89bn.\n\"With this award, Nasa and our partners will complete the first crewed demonstration mission to the surface of the Moon in the 21st century as the agency takes a step forward for women's equality and long-term deep space exploration,\" said Kathy Lueders, the organisation's head of human exploration. \n\"This critical step puts humanity on a path to sustainable lunar exploration and keeps our eyes on missions farther into the Solar System, including Mars.\"\nThe Artemis programme, initiated under the Trump administration, had targeted a return to the lunar surface in 2024. But a shortfall in funding of the landing system has made that goal unattainable.\nElon Musk has been developing the Starship design for years. Resembling the rocketships from the golden age of science fiction, it is a crucial component of the entrepreneur's long-term plans for settling humans on Mars.\nFor now, though, it will serve as the lander that ferries astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface.\nWith a spacious cabin and two airlocks, allowing astronauts to exit the craft for moonwalks, it's a far cry from the cramped, spindly lunar module (LM) that carried 12 men to the surface under the US Apollo programme between 1969 and 1972.\nThe new vehicle will be known as the Human Landing System (HLS).\nIn recent times, Nasa has chosen more than one company when procuring space transport services, giving it options if one of them fails to deliver. \nMore of our reporting on the Artemis programme\nBut Nasa has received only $850m of the $3.3bn it requested from Congress to build the Moon lander. In a statement, Ms Lueders said that \"while it remains the agency's desire to preserve a competitive environment at this stage of the HLS program\", its current budget precluded it from selecting two companies, as it was expected to.\nCost is believed to have been a major factor; SpaceX's bid was the lowest of the three competitors \"by a wide margin\".\nMs Lueders explained: \"I made a determination that it would be in the agency's best interests to make an initial, conditional selection of SpaceX.\"\nThe decision has caused a stir in Congress. Nasa is undergoing a transition of power following Joe Biden's election as President. It is being run by an interim administrator, and Mr Biden's pick to run the agency - former senator and astronaut Bill Nelson - will appear at his confirmation hearing next week. \n\"I am disappointed that the acting Nasa leadership decided to make such a consequential award prior to the arrival of a new permanent Nasa administrator and deputy administrator,\" said congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, the democrat chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\n\"The decision to make the award today also comes despite the obvious need for a re-baselining of Nasa's lunar exploration program, which has no realistic chance of returning US astronauts to the Moon by 2024.\"\nNasa is targeting the Moon's South Polar region for the first landing with astronauts since 1972. This area holds abundant deposits of water-ice, which could be turned into rocket fuel and breathable air to support a future lunar base. \nBut touching down here also presents challenges, because the angle of the Sun casts long shadows that obscure surface features as the craft comes down to land.\nEngineers will need to navigate the problem as they refine their plans for the first Artemis landing.\nSpaceX had been in a run-off against the National Team - consisting of Blue Origin (founded by Bezos), Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper - and defence contractor Dynetics.\nIt represents another milestone for the 19-year-old company founded by Musk, which initially had to overcome widespread scepticism about its plans to bring down the costs of spaceflight. SpaceX almost ran out of money, but was kept going by a fortuitous contract award from Nasa in 2008.\nSince then, it has achieved huge success launching commercial satellites and picked up a lucrative contract to fly people to the ISS.\nThe Starship vehicle is currently being tested at a facility in Boca Chica, South Texas. A number of uncrewed prototypes have already been launched to altitudes of 10km or more, before being brought back down in an attempt to land them softly on the ground. However, the last few test flights ended with the vehicles exploding, either close to or on the pad after their return.\n\"This is an exciting time for Nasa and especially the Artemis team,\" said Lisa Watson-Morgan, programme manager for the Human Landing System at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. \n\"During the Apollo programme, we proved that it is possible to do the seemingly impossible: land humans on the Moon. By taking a collaborative approach in working with industry while leveraging Nasa's proven technical expertise and capabilities, we will return American astronauts to the Moon's surface once again, this time to explore new areas for longer periods of time.\"\nThe Artemis programme aims to establish a long-term presence on the Moon, including the establishment of a lunar base.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "China,GDP,Economic growth,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "China's economy grew a record 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter last year. \nIt's the biggest jump in gross domestic product (GDP) since China started keeping quarterly records in 1992. \nHowever, Friday's figures are below expectations, with a Reuters poll of economists predicting 19% growth. \nThey are also heavily skewed, and less indicative of strong growth, as they are compared to last year's huge economic contraction.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, China's economy shrank 6.8% due to nationwide lockdowns at the peak of its Covid-19 outbreak.   \n\"The national economy made a good start,\" said China's National Bureau of Statistics, which released the first quarter data.\nBut it added: \"We must be aware that the Covid-19 epidemic is still spreading globally and the international landscape is complicated with high uncertainties and instabilities.\"\nOther key figures released by China's statistics department also point to a continuing rebound, but are also unusually strong because they are compared against extremely weak numbers from last year.  \nIndustrial output for March rose 14.1% over a year ago, while retail sales grew 34.2%. \nIt's ironic that China's economic boom has been announced just as its leader wrestles with the problem of climate change - which has been caused by economic growth over the decades.\nHistorically, that growth has been almost completely fuelled by emissions from burning coal, gas and oil.\nChina has promised to freeze its growth in emissions by 2030 and halt them totally by 2060.\nBut President Xi is hearing from France's President Macron and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel  that it can and should freeze emissions earlier - perhaps by 2025.\nLeaders of the EU and US are also urging China to stop funding new coal-fired power plants in poor nations in the so-called Belt and Road initiative.\nThe world will suffer, they say, if African nations follow the polluting path to prosperity laid down by nations which got rich on coal.\n\"Promisingly, the monthly indicators suggest that industrial production, consumption and investment all gained pace in March on a sequential basis, following the weakness in the first two months,\" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at research and consultancy firm Oxford Economics. \nHowever, some analysts predicted a number of sectors will slow as government fiscal and monetary support is reduced.\nYue Su,  the Economist Intelligence Unit's principal economist for China, while the latest figures show that the country's economic recovery is broad-based, some production and export activity could have been \"front-loaded\" into the first quarter, suggesting slower growth ahead. \n\"Trade performance and domestic industrial activities for the rest of year might not be able to maintain such strong momentum, due to lack of measures to stimulate domestic economy,\" she said.  \nThe figures nevertheless suggest China has continued to gain economic momentum. Comparing growth for the last quarter with the last quarter of 2020, the Chinese economy grew by a far smaller 0.6%.\nHelped by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered steadily since the pandemic hit. \nDespite a calamitous start to the year, China was the only major economy to register growth in 2020 albeit its weakest in decades, at 2.3%.\nChina has set an economic growth target of 6% for 2021, after scrapping its target last year."

She has transplanted herself into you. It is the spirit of woman,\" openDemocracy reports. \nThe video which was viewed more than 1.5 million before the YouTube channel was taken down, later shows her testifying before the congregation that \"the spirit of woman\" had been destroying her life but she had been healed after the preacher's prayers. \nShe declares that she had stopped having \"affection\" to women and  \"now I have affections for men\".\nThe founder of the Synagogue, Church of All Nations is one of Nigeria's most popular televangelists but is perhaps the least flamboyant of his peers.\nTens of thousands of people attend his weekly services in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos.\nHis rise to prominence in the late 1990s coincided with the explosion of \"miracle\" programmes performed on national TV by various pastors.\nTB Joshua was often mocked for lacking the finesse of his colleagues during \"deliverance\" sessions - an intense prayer that resembles exorcism. \nHis ministry professes to heal all manner of illnesses including HIV/Aids and attracts people from all over the world.\nKnown as the \"Prophet\" by his followers, Mr Joshua runs the Christian television station Emmanuel TV and often tours Africa, the US, the UK and South America.\nIn 2014, one of his churches collapsed, killing at least 116 people, including many South Africans.\nA coroner in a Lagos court said \"the church was culpable because of criminal negligence\" but he never faced any charges.\nNo. \nIn May 2004 the National Broadcasting Commission banned TV stations from showing programmes of pastors performing miracles on television unless they had been verified.\nThere were accusations that some of the miracles were fake and performed by actors.\nTV stations pulled the pastors' programmes to avoid having their licences revoked or being hit by fines from the NBC.\nBut as free-to-air satellite boxes became affordable and popular in many Nigerian homes, the televangelists set up broadcast facilities and continued with their \"miracle\" programmes.\nThey broadcast with state-of-the-art facilities and have dedicated channels on major satellite TV providers in Africa, showing activities of the churches and pastors non-stop.

      "text": "A new independent review group will assess the prescription of puberty blockers for under-16s, NHS England has announced.\nPuberty blockers are prescribed to some young people who are experiencing gender dysphoria - a \"mismatch\" between their biological sex and gender identity.\nThe announcement follows a ruling from the Family Division of the High Court in March, which said parents can consent to the treatment on behalf of their child.\nBut the judge added it may be that \"additional safeguards\" should be built into decision-making. \nThe case was brought after three high court judges had previously ruled that children under 16 were unlikely to be able to give informed consent for the treatment. \nThat ruling, in December, was from a case brought against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust which provides England's only NHS specialist gender clinic for children. \nNHS England said its new processes were being introduced on an \"interim basis\" while it awaits the outcome of a review into gender identity services. \nIt said it had \"carefully reviewed\" the parental consent judgement from March along with \"significant concerns\" raised by a recent Care Quality Commission report about the clinic and a puberty blockers evidence review by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. \nThe health body said that while parental consent had not been \"historically\" relied on it may be for existing patients who are already being prescribed puberty blockers. \nIn such cases there would need to be \"full agreement\" between the child, parent(s) and clinical team as well as support from the new review group. \nIt added that, should the review group have doubts about whether the decision-making process was \"robust\", a best interests decision could still be sought from court.\nTreatment will not be withdrawn for existing patients until the review group's view is known or further consideration by the court. \n\u00b7        What are puberty blockers?\n\u00b7        What does transgender mean and what does the law say?\nThe same interim process will be used for new patients once the Tavistock clinic decides to resume making new referrals, NHS England said.\nA statement from Tavistock and Portman said it welcomed the update \"that parental consent may form a legal basis to prescribe puberty blockers to children under 16 years\".\nThe trust added: \"We will be working with NHS England on the implications of these changes for patients currently in treatment and new referrals, and will issue more information about this as soon as we are able.\" \nNew referrals were paused in December following the High Court ruling.  \nThe review group will be made up of health and care professionals with expertise in child development, neurodevelopment and mental health.\nIt's not clear when it will be established but NHS England said more details would be available \"in due course\". \nUntil the group is operational a requirement for a best interests order from the court, for new patients, will remain."

      "text": "Ra\u00fal Castro has stepped down as first secretary of Cuba's Communist Party. \nThe move means that for the first time in more than five decades, the party - which has ruled the island since the party's formation in 1965 - is not led by either Ra\u00fal Castro or his late brother, Fidel.\nFidel Castro led the revolution that toppled the Cuban government in 1959 and his younger brother Ra\u00fal was one of the commanders. \nBorn on 3 June 1931 and educated at a Jesuit school in the Cuban capital, Havana, Ra\u00fal Castro went on to study economics at university in Havana, where he joined a communist youth group.\nIn 1953, he helped his older brother, Fidel, plan and execute a failed attack on the Moncada military barracks in Santiago de Cuba in an attempt to oust Gen Fulgencio Batista.\nHe was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his part in the attack but was granted an amnesty in 1955 and went into exile in Mexico.\nThere, he befriended the Argentine revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and introduced him to Fidel Castro.\nRa\u00fal Castro returned to Cuba in December 1956 on board the ship Granma as one of his brother Fidel's group of exiles known as the 26 July Revolutionary Movement.\nThey conducted a guerrilla warfare campaign from the Sierra Maestra mountains which led to the overthrow of Gen Batista's government and forced Batista to flee. \nFidel Castro was sworn in as prime minister and put Ra\u00fal in charge of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, a post he held until 2008.  \nWhether presiding over military parades or reading to Cubans in the countryside, he could most often be seen in his olive green uniform. \nThe father of Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro was a prosperous sugar cane farmer and Ra\u00fal would sometimes pose for photographs among fields of Cuba's most important crop. \nIn 1965, Ra\u00fal Castro assumed the post of second secretary of the Central Committee in the newly formed Communist Party of Cuba.\nHis older brother, Fidel, held the post of first secretary from 1965 until 2011, when he resigned and Ra\u00fal Castro assumed what is arguably the most influential position in Cuba.\nWhile Ra\u00fal Castro has spent most of his life in the shadow of his brother Fidel, during his time as Cuba's president - first in an acting capacity from 2006 and later officially from 2008 to 2018 - the younger Castro not only welcomed Pope Francis to the island in 2015...\n...he also shook hands with US President Barack Obama in a gesture that signalled a thaw in the relations between the two countries in 2015.\nThe two leaders would meet again in 2016 when Barack Obama joined Ra\u00fal Castro in the stands at a baseball game in Havana during the US leader's landmark trip to the Communist island. \nFollowing the death of Fidel Castro on 25 November 2016, it fell to his younger brother to place the urn containing the ashes in his tomb at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba. \nAll pictures subject to copyright."

      "text": "More than 200 jobs are at risk at a car parts firm in south Wales.\nKautex Textron said the closure of its Ystrad Mynach site in Caerphilly county was being considered, with the economic impact of Brexit and Covid \"key contributors\".\nThe firm has confirmed provisional discussions regarding staff reductions have started with unions and employees.\nA consultation period between staff and management has begun, with talks set to last until at least mid-May.\nKautex Textron has had a site in Ystrad Mynach for more than 50 years and makes hoses, water containers and nozzles.\nAlmost 16,000 people are employed in the automotive industry in Wales - about 220 of them at Kautext Textron's site on the Dyffryn Business Park.\nExperts had warned the sector faced challenges because of Brexit trade changes.\n\"We can confirm we have entered into provisionary discussions regarding staff reductions and potentially a site closure,\" the company said.\n\"Brexit, as well as the ongoing economic impact of Covid-19, are the key contributors to this decision.\"\nKautext Textron worker Sharon Harrison said everyone was concerned for their future: \"What am I going to do? I've got a mortgage to pay, I've got bills to pay.\n\"There are quite a few families here as well, there are husbands and wives.\n\"Manufacturing is declining and it has been for a few years, so this is a blow - a big blow for the area.\n\"It's not just for us working here, it's for our supply chain too.\"\nThe GMB Union said it was notified by the manufacturing company before Easter that it was considering cutting the workforce and the Welsh government said it was \"working with the company\" to help save jobs.\nMike Payne, the union's senior Wales and South West organiser, has had discussions with Kautext Textron management and said a \"whole site closure\" was being considered because of a \"downturn in sales in the global market\".\n\"It is a profitable site, but Brexit is playing a big part in this,\" he added. \n\"Clients are starting to argue production should be closer to their bases in continental Europe.\n\"It's absolutely devastating for our members at the plant but also for the local economy, the businesses that supply the plant and the Welsh manufacturing industry in general.\"\nHe told BBC Radio Wales the union understood the site could close in 12 to 18 months, and if it could not be saved it would enter redundancy negotiations\nMr Payne added that the union was working with the company and the Welsh government to try and secure a support package to keep the site open.\nGMB said the company was looking at how it could expand into other products, with the potential to then cut just 44 people from the workforce.\nSimon Duval-Smith, former editor of the Automotive Purchasing and Supply Chain magazine, said \"Brexit is a double edged sword\" for Kautex.\nHe told BBC Radio Wales that Brexit required companies to provide more forms and materials to export materials into Europe, which was a cause of the potential closure.\nBut Mr Duval-Smith also said that since leaving the EU \"Wales is now free to offer greater incentives to companies to locate in Wales, and also to stay here\".\nThe Welsh government said it was \"working with the company to explore potential solutions to help sustain the plant\".\n\"This is clearly a concerning time and we are monitoring the situation closely,\" a spokesman added."
