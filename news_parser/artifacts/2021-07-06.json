      "text": "The Duchess of Cambridge is having to self-isolate for 10 days after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive for Covid.\nShe had been due to spend the day with the Duke of Cambridge to mark the 73rd anniversary of the NHS.\nBut Prince William arrived alone for a service at St Paul's Cathedral and a Buckingham Palace tea for NHS staff.\nKensington Palace said she does not have any symptoms, but is \"following all relevant government guidelines\".\nIt said in a statement: \"Last week the Duchess of Cambridge came into contact with someone who has subsequently tested positive for Covid-19.\n\"Her Royal Highness is not experiencing any symptoms, but is following all relevant government guidelines and is self-isolating at home.\"\nCatherine's last public event was a visit to Wimbledon on Friday when she toured the venue and met staff in its museum and Centre Court kitchen.\nShe also sat with the Duke of Kent in the royal box on Centre Court and with former British number one tennis player Tim Henman on Court 14 to watch Jamie Murray play in a men's doubles match.\nThe duchess is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club and a keen tennis fan, but is now likely to miss the men's and women's finals at the weekend.\nThe duchess, who has received both her Covid jabs, began self-isolating on Friday after being alerted that afternoon.\nThe PA news agency says she follows the royal household testing regime by taking lateral flow tests twice a week.\nIt reports she additionally took lateral flow tests before visiting Wimbledon and watching England's Euro 2020 victory against Germany last Tuesday at Wembley with Prince William and Prince George. Both results were negative.\nPrince William contracted Covid last spring but was able to carry on with telephone and online engagements while being treated by royal doctors.\nThe Prince of Wales also caught the virus during the same period but had milder symptoms, although he did lose his sense of smell and taste for a period."

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Employment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland will follow England's example and lift its working from home guidance. \nPeople across the rest of the UK are still advised to work remotely wherever possible. \nFrom Monday 31 January, the government will no longer recommend home working wherever possible.\nInstead, employers are being asked to let workers return gradually. It wants workers to spend some time in the office and some time at home. \nA wholesale \"mass return\" to offices next week could risk pushing up infection levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 January, Boris Johnson said that the government was no longer asking staff to work from home.\nHe said people \"should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office\". \nThe government had reintroduced its guidance to work remotely when it tightened Covid regulations on 8 December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. \nHowever, that guidance did also say that people should continue travelling to work if they needed \"to access equipment necessary for their role, or where their role must be completed in person\".  \nEmployers were also told to consider letting people come to work if they had a \"challenging home working environment\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers said that more people working from home would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they didn't tell employers to impose home working, but instead asked them to support it \"where possible\".\nIn Wales, employers are also encouraged to let people work from home where possible. Guidance says staff should not be \"required or placed under pressure to return\" to the workplace unless there's a clear business need. Employers could be fined up to \u00a310,000 for failing to allow staff to work from home where it is \"reasonably practicable to do so\".\nFrom 28 January, the requirement to work from home moves from law to guidance. \nLatest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020, up from 27% the previous year.\nIn the last week of November 2021, seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. \nIn the same week, one in seven said they had been working at home and travelling to work.\nAlthough social distancing limits no longer apply across most UK workplaces businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks to staff and customers. \nEmployers must follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. \nSafety measures can include:\nFace-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England, where they will cease to be required in any public space on 27 January. \nRegular lateral flow testing remains widespread across the NHS and other parts of the public and private sector.\nNorthern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have already introduced Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. \nHowever, England will scrap its mandatory Covid certification scheme from Thursday 27 January, although venues will be able to keep checking customers' status on a voluntary basis if they wish. \nThere is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIf employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nWorking from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce social exposure, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nIt greatly limits face-to-face contact both with colleagues and on public transport.\nAs such, Sage says it has a \"strong impact\" against virus transmission and the R number, which represents a disease's ability to spread.\nMuch of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.\nWearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible."

      "text": "England's schools will find out later how the government plans to relax rules that have led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive Covid test.  \nLast week the \"bubble\" system saw more than 375,000 children sent home.\nIt has meant missed days of lessons for thousands of pupils and frustration for parents juggling work and childcare.\nThe announcement will come amid a backlash to government plans to ditch rules on the wearing of face masks.\nLabour, trade unions and some scientists have said now is not the time to change the rules on masks as case numbers continue to rise rapidly, driven by the new, more infectious Delta variant.\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he would make an announcement to MPs later on self-isolation changes for those who have had been fully vaccinated.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"We will have a more proportionate system of test, trace and isolate and it is absolutely right that those that have been double jabbed, that we can take a different approach than the one we can take today.\"\nHe said the UK was now entering \"uncharted territory\" as it moved to lift legal restrictions aimed at controlling the spread of coronavirus but he said the decision had to be made because of the \"other health problems\" millions of people were facing. \nAt a Downing Street press conference on Monday, Boris Johnson confirmed he intended to scrap the laws on mask wearing and social distancing in the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap on 19 July.\nThe date will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data.\nOther changes announced on Monday include the planned reopening of nightclubs for the first time since the pandemic began, an end to all legal limits on the number of people who can attend events and the scrapping of guidance to work from home.\nOn schools, Mr Johnson said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson would outline a move away from sending \"bubbles\" home and from contact isolation for pupils so as to \"greatly reduce the impact on schools of Covid outbreaks\".\n\"And obviously the way forward is with testing rather than by sending the bubbles home,\" he added.\nThere has been widespread concern that thousands of pupils are missing school unnecessarily. \nLast month the number sent home from school for Covid-related reasons quadrupled - but only about 4% were confirmed cases, with most pupils sent home because of a potential contact at school.\nMr Williamson is expected to say the changes will come into effect on 19 July, alongside the lifting of other Covid restrictions. \nThe PM's message on Monday was it was \"now or never\" to lift the restrictions.\nHe said the success of the vaccine rollout had weakened the link between cases and deaths.\n\"If we don't go ahead now, when we've clearly done so much with the vaccination programme to break the link... when would we go ahead?\"\nHe added: \"We run the risk of either opening up at a very difficult time when the virus has an edge, has an advantage, in the cold months, or again putting everything off to next year.\"\nOn Monday, a further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK - and another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn a sombre warning, Mr Johnson warned cases were predicted to rise to 50,000 a day later this month - and more people would die.\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College, whose modelling led to the first nationwide restrictions, said there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could \"still cause some pressure to the health system\".\nHowever he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a \"slight gamble\" he thought it was \"justifiable\", adding \"I'm reasonably optimistic\".\nHe said that in the worst-case scenario there \"may need to be a course correction later\".\nLabour politicians, as well as some doctors and trade unions, have expressed concern that the lifting of the restrictions may be premature.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's plan was \"reckless\" and urged a more \"balanced approach\" to keep protections in place.\nHe suggested the compulsory use of masks in enclosed spaces and on public transport.\nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, who is opposed to the lifting of the face-covering rule, said that while he had the power to continue to make them mandatory on Manchester's tram network, he would not do so as \"I just don't see how we would be able to enforce it\".\nAnd Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said discussions were planned between Transport for London, the Department for Transport and other transport providers \"before we decide our next steps\".\nTrade union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of public transport workers, said it would be \"an act of gross negligence by the government\" to end the requirement to wear face coverings on public transport in two weeks.\nDr Nathalie MacDermott, an infectious diseases expert at Kings College London, said that now was not the right time to lift all restrictions.\n\"If we give the virus a foothold now by removing restrictions, we're probably just setting ourselves up for a bigger problem in the autumn,\" she told BBC's Newsnight. \n\"We should be waiting until all of our adult population - and possibly some of our younger adult population, or children and young people - are immunised, fully immunised, before we reduce our restrictions.\"\nSpeaking alongside Mr Johnson on Monday, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned this coming winter \"may be very difficult for the NHS\".\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the link between cases, hospital admission and death had been \"weakened, not broken\" by the vaccines.\nAt the press conference, there was also a suggestion that a new tracing system would be introduced for fully vaccinated people, with an announcement expected this week.\nMr Johnson said a test, trace and isolate system that is \"proportionate to the pandemic\" would continue to be used.\n\"You will have to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to do so by NHS test and trace,\" he said.\n\"We are looking to move to a different regime for fully vaccinated contacts of those testing positive, and also for children.\"\nMr Johnson also ruled out making domestic vaccine passports mandatory at this stage in the pandemic.\nHe said Covid status certificates would not be needed for entry to venues or events, but he said businesses might choose to employ checks of an individual's NHS app to see their status.\nOn the vaccine roll-out, Mr Johnson said the gap between first and second vaccine jabs for the under-40s would be shortened from 12 weeks to eight.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules.\nThe Scottish government has said it may continue to require masks in certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end.\nAhead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said people would need to learn to live with Covid. Rules in Northern Ireland have just eased, with another review due on 8 July.\nIs your child or your child's teacher self-isolating?

      "tags": "Cuba,Severe weather",
      "text": "After causing devastation in the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Elsa is moving north towards the Florida Keys.\nMore than 100,000 people in Cuba were evacuated before Elsa hit on Monday, causing mudslides and \"flooding rains\".\nIn the days before, the storm passed over the Dominican Republic and St Lucia, killing three people.\nOfficials in Florida have said they are \"very hopeful\" that they won't have to pause rescue efforts at the site of a collapsed building in Miami.\nThe demolition of the partially collapsed apartment block had been brought forward, for fear that Elsa might topple the building in an uncontrolled way.\nForecasters have since shifted the storm's likely path westward, suggesting that rather than hitting Florida directly, it will only skim the state's southwest coast.\nThe storm is expected to approach the Florida Keys on Tuesday.\nCuba's meteorological institute Insmet said the storm had passed through the island with winds of up to 100km/h, with \"some stronger gusts\".\nIt added that Elsa was expected to dump heavy rains over the island as it exited.\nBy 21:00 local time on Monday (01:00 GMT on Tuesday) Elsa had moved out of Cuba towards the Gulf of Mexico.\nJose Rubiera, Cuba's best known meteorologist, said on state television: \"The rain is coming behind the centre so the fact it is moving out to sea along the northern coast between Havana and Mayabeque... does not mean the rain is over.\"\nRainfall of 13 to 25 cm (five to 10 inches) was forecast across parts of Cuba on Monday night, with up to 38 cm (15 inches) in specific areas, the NHC said.\nThe storm hit Cuba as the country battled its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the start of the pandemic, raising fears that the mass evacuations could lead to a further spike in infections.\nOn Friday, Elsa became the first hurricane of the Atlantic season before weakening to a tropical storm.\nAt least two people died on Saturday when walls collapsed in high winds in the Dominican Republic on Saturday. \nThe victims were a 15-year-old boy in Barahona, in the south of the country, and a 75-year-old woman west of the capital, Santo Domingo. \nOn the Eastern Caribbean island of St Lucia, one man also died, according to Prime Minister Allen Chastanet.\nIn Barbados, hundreds of homes have reportedly been damaged.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Department of Health & Social Care,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says.\nSajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date.\nThe government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added.\nMeanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announced the end of \"bubbles\" in schools from 19 July.\nThis system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test.\nCovid-related pupil absence in England has hit a new high since all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week.\nOn Monday, the prime minister confirmed he intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictions in England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing.\nA further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: \"From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated.\n\"If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms.\" \nAs under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them.\nMr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be \"advised\" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age.\nPeople identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nHe added that \"of course\" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers \"it makes sense\" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August.\nIt said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs.\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement \"doesn't go far enough, quickly enough\".\nChief executive Kate Nicholls said it \"fails to recognise the carnage the current system\" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who \"have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive\".\nThe NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move \"may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid\".\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing \"the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country\", Mr Javid said.\nEarlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be \"at least double\" what they were now \"so around 50,000 new cases a day\".\n\"As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,\" he said. \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK \"building a protective wall\" of vaccines. \nHowever, Mr Ashworth said the \"wall is only part built\", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people.\nHe said he \"understood the rationale\" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the \"biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy\" was a \"lack of financial incentive to stay at home\".\nHe also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: \"Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way.\"\nThe Scottish government has said it may continue to require masks in certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end.\nAhead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said people would need to learn to live with Covid.\nNorthern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless.\nShe said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would \"not be following that model\". \nIreland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan \"too risky\" and warned if things went wrong there would be a \"spillover effect\" into neighbouring countries.\nAsked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: \"Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place.\"\nThe lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves.\nNo other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant.\nSo, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether.\nIf cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter.\nSoon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000.\nThese are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to.\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could \"still cause some pressure to the health system\".\nHowever he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a \"slight gamble\" he thought it was \"justifiable\", adding \"I'm reasonably optimistic.\"\nHe said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. \"The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold.\"\nIn the worst-case scenario there \"may need to be a course correction later\", he added.\nBusinesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July.\nMelvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had \"got this right\", adding that \"the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen\". \nHe also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors.\nHowever, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still \"encourage guests\" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

It still hurts now that I couldn't do it, it's something I'm very ashamed of.\"\nIn March 2018, she was given a two-year custodial sentence, which was later suspended by the Court of Appeal. By then she had already served 11 weeks in jail and had lost her council house.\n\"I've lost everything, I lost my house, all my possessions, I've self-harmed, I've cut myself to try and make myself feel nothing, just to go completely numb,\" she said.\n\"The help I'm getting now, if I'd got that four years ago I'd never have ended up in that situation.\"\nRhondda AM Leanne Wood, a former probation officer, said there needed to be as wide a number of sentencing options available as possible.\n\"I think we have to send fewer women to prison, generally, because when you look at the prison population you see people with chronic problems that need help and support,\" said the former Plaid Cymru leader. \n\"I accept some people need to be in a residential setting for their own safety - and perhaps for the safety of others -  but we're talking about a tiny number among the female offending population.\"\nProf Kate Williams, from the Centre for Criminology at the University of South Wales, said judges need to be made more aware of the needs of women caught up in the criminal justice system.\n\"The punishment we typically give women is too harsh\", she said. \"Many of the problems that turn out to be criminal offending actually start because of issues they have to face and can't deal with, and we criminalise them for it, instead of trying to be a bit more understanding.\"\nA MoJ spokesperson said: \"We want to see fewer women serving short custodial sentences as evidence clearly shows that putting them into prison can do more harm than good for society, failing to cut the cycle of reoffending and often exacerbating already difficult family circumstances. \n\"Instead, we are shifting the focus to managing women in the community where they can access a wider range of support, for example helping them with substance misuse and mental health problems.\""

      "text": "Tougher sentences should be imposed on people who deliberately try to infect police officers with Covid, according to the Scottish Police Federation.\nThe body which represents rank and file officers warned its members face a \"new level of risk\".\nMore than 1,000 police assaults in the past year involved spitting or coughing or were otherwise linked to the virus.\nThe federation said this year alone there had been more than 420 cases of spitting recorded. \nIt said the culprits were often treated too leniently by the courts.\nThe federation said Chief Constable Iain Livingstone had made it clear violent and abusive behaviour against officers would not be accepted. \nIt said that while these acts had always carried the risk of spreading infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV, there was a new level of risk because of Covid.\nThe SPF's general secretary, Calum Steele, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland  programme that very few cases resulted in imprisonment, which meant there was a \"lack of a deterrent\". \nHe said of the 420 cases this year you could \"probably count on the fingers of one hand\" the number which resulted in a custodial sentence. \n\"If assaults of this nature do not warrant a prison sentence, then what on earth kind of offence does?\", he added.\nHe said if a custodial sentence was not imposed it was incumbent that an explanation was provided about why this was not appropriate. \nDeputy Chief Constable Fiona Taylor said: \"Officers and staff work with dedication and a commitment to helping people and violence and abuse against them is utterly deplorable and unacceptable. It is not simply part of the job and will not be tolerated.\"\nAs well as assaults, officers have reported Covid-related incidents after having their masks dislodged during a struggle.\nLast year, the SPF called for anyone who commits such an assault to be automatically held in custody until they appear in court.\nThe issue was highlighted in the justice and social affairs magazine 1919. \nIt reported that among those convicted was former West Bromwich Albion and Wrexham footballer James Hurst, who coughed at police officers after claiming he had coronavirus. He was given a community sentence.\nOther cases have resulted in custodial sentences, including George Crean, who spat at a police officer and \"joked\" about coronavirus. He was jailed for 12 months.\nStephen Gilhoolie, who was spotted carrying a knife, was sentenced to 25 months after he claimed to have the virus and coughed on officers during his arrest.\nFigures released in May show assaults increased overall by 6.3% in 2020-21 compared with the previous year, with 6,942 attacks recorded on officers and staff.\nOf these, 1,087 were Covid-related after analysts searched for case keywords such as \"spit\" and \"cough\".\nHowever, the true figure will be higher with no data available from the Borders, Edinburgh, Highland or Tayside divisions."

      "tags": "Media,Amsterdam,Journalism,Netherlands",
      "text": "A prominent Dutch journalist known for investigating the criminal underworld has been shot and seriously wounded on a street in central Amsterdam.\nPeter R de Vries, 64, was shot minutes after leaving a TV studio, where he had appeared on a chat show.\nMr de Vries is famed for his work on exposing mobsters and drug lords, and has helped police solve a number of high-profile cases.\nThree men were arrested, but police say one is no longer a suspect.\nHours after the attack, two men were arrested in a car on the A4 motorway at Leidschendam - a 35-year-old Polish national living in Maurik and a 21-year-old man living in Rotterdam. They will face court on Friday.\nAn 18-year-old was arrested in Amsterdam, but will be released.\nThe mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described Mr de Vries as \"a national hero to us all\" and as \"a rare, courageous journalist who tirelessly sought justice\". \nThe attack happened just after 19:30 (17:30 GMT), as the journalist was walking away from the studio on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat.\nFive shots were fired at close range and Mr de Vries, 64, was hit in the head, local media report.\nMr de Vries was previously given police protection after receiving threats for his involvement in criminal cases as an investigative journalist. In 2019 he tweeted that police had told him he was on the hit list of the Netherlands' most wanted criminal.\nMayor Halsema said the journalist was fighting for his life, and condemned the shooting as a \"cruel, heartless attack\".\nPolice are appealing for witnesses and CCTV footage of the shooting but are asking people not to share the material on social media. YouTube said it had removed hundreds of videos from its platform.\nThe attack has shaken the Netherlands, with messages of support for Mr de Vries and the safety of all journalists coming from leading figures across the country.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the shooting as \"shocking and incomprehensible,\" adding it was an attack on a \"courageous journalist\" and on the freedom on the press.\nJustice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus paid tribute to an \"extraordinary journalist\", calling Mr de Vries an \"admirable warrior against injustice for the underdog\".\nKing Willem-Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima said they were \"deeply shocked\" and that \"journalists must be free to carry out their important work without threats.\"\nThere have also been strong reactions from outside the Netherlands. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel called the attack a crime against journalism.\n\"We will relentlessly continue to defend the freedom of the press,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nPeter R de Vries has covered numerous high-profile crimes, including the 1983 kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken.\nIn 2013 Heineken's kidnapper, Willem Holleeder, was convicted of making threats against Mr de Vries. \nOne of the Netherlands' most notorious gangsters, Holleeder was given a life sentence in 2019 for his involvement in five murders.\nA novel Mr de Vries wrote about the case was later adapted into the movie Kidnapping Freddy Heineken starring Anthony Hopkins.\nThe journalist also won an Emmy Award for a television show he made about Natalee Holloway, a US teenager who disappeared on the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005. \nMr de Vries had been acting as an adviser to a former gang member, Nabil B, who was testifying in the case against Ridouan Taghi, who is currently on trial in the Netherlands for murder and drug trafficking.\nThe case has already sent shock waves through Netherlands after Nabil B's previous lawyer Derk Wiersum was assassinated in front of his Amsterdam home in September 2019.\nPeter R de Vries rose to prominence reporting on the types of crimes he appears to have fallen victim to.\nThe attempt on his life has stunned Dutch society, particularly those in the professions where he has played such a critical role - journalism and criminal justice. \nMayor Femke Halsema described Mr de Vries as a national hero, \"brave, looking for justice, free spirit, helping people in distress, parents of murdered children\".\nHe was immersed in the job and his involvement in numerous high-profile cases resulted in repeated calls from the underworld for his \"liquidation\". \nThe Dutch Bar Association has released a statement describing the \"brutal attack\" as having an enormous impact on the legal profession.\nMr de Vries is a regular on Dutch chat shows. Last week he launched a crowdfunding campaign to try to raise a million euros to solve a cold case before the parents of the victim, Tanja Groen, passed away.\nHumberto Tan, a TV presenter, described Mr de Vries as a journalist with an enormous heart.

      "tags": "Policing,Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Criminal justice system",
      "text": "Proposals for England and Wales mean people who claim to have been raped will still face pressure to hand over their phones to police and prosecutors, says the victims' commissioner.\nThe government's apology to rape victims has been \"undermined\" by the move, Dame Vera Baird told the BBC. \nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill sets limits to police access to victims' phone data. \nBut these safeguards should be stronger, argues Dame Vera. \nThe Home Office says there will be a code of practice alongside the new law to protect the privacy of victims and witnesses. \nLast month, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to rape victims for low conviction rates in England and Wales and promised \"to do a lot better\". \nBut Dame Vera warns that while the proposed legislation requires police to get the agreement of potential rape victims to hand over their phones or other personal data such as medical records, it does not define exactly what \"agreement\" means. \nNor does it set limits on what information can be downloaded from phones, nor how it might be used. \n\"It is definitely a backward step,\" says Dame Vera, \"and it definitely clashes with the apology from ministers and with the intention in the rape review to focus on the defendant and less on the complainant.\"\nVictims of sexual crimes are often put under pressure by police and prosecutors to hand over their phones because of the possibility they might have sent private messages which undermine their evidence.\nThis is voluntary, but victims are often told the case will be closed if they do not comply, and some withdraw because they are uncomfortable handing over private data. \nSarah Jenkin has taken the rare step of waiving her legal right to anonymity because of her anger at the way she was treated after alleging she had been raped. \nShe had been drinking heavily and was unable to give a detailed account of what had happened. The man whom she accused denied rape.\nSarah said the police had not initially wanted to access her phone but later said it was necessary. \n\"I got the impression that it had been requested that the police get that information. Requested by, I assume, the CPS...\n\"I feel very angry about what has happened, the trauma that I've suffered directly from the treatment of particular aspects of the criminal justice system is unbelievable.\"\nSarah said the CPS claimed there were inconsistencies in her messages to friends.\n\"They seemed, certainly in my case, to be using this information as a way to try to discredit me, discredit my account, imply that I'm not a credible witness.\"\nHowever, she said, her personal messages would have also made it clear she was gay, and had no history with men, suggesting it was unlikely she would have consented to sex. \n\"This was something that I raised with the CPS only to be told that my sexuality wasn't relevant, which was very hurtful,\" she told the BBC. \nThe case was dropped by the CPS after prosecutors said they would offer no evidence. The man she accused was acquitted.\nEven a tighter law, to protect victims of crime, would only go so far in restoring her trust in the justice system, she said. \nA Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said the case was stopped after a \"careful review\" because it did not meet the legal test required for a prosecution. \n\"Every rape case that comes to the CPS is dealt with by a specialist prosecutor in a dedicated rape and sexual offences unit. \n\"Each one is decided on its own merits and whenever the legal test is met, we will not hesitate to prosecute.\" \nPolice forces have already ditched a process for obtaining large amounts of phone data, described by campaigners as a \"digital strip-search\". \nBut recent research for the government's review of rape cases, suggested it was often prosecutors, rather than police officers, who pushed for victims' data, to enable \"robust\" charging decisions.\nIn a statement, the Home Office said the new law would \"outline the general duties\" of police and prosecutors but there would also be a code of practice on how the powers should be used, to protect the privacy of victims and witnesses.\nWork is underway to ensure the criminal justice system only takes information from victims \"where it is necessary for the investigation and not as a matter of course,\" said an official.  \nDame Vera says that, behind the scenes, senior police officers support her attempts to protect victims.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has, in the past, been accused of investigating the person reporting a rape or sexual assault, rather than the suspect, and of trying to prevent cases going to court if they are less likely to result in a conviction.\nThis was one of the reasons why the government, through Mr Buckland, apologised to rape victims. \nThe government's rape review concluded: \"These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed.\" \n\"Victims of rape are being failed.\""

      "text": "Richard Donner, the Hollywood director whose films included Superman and The Goonies, has died aged 91.\nHe passed away on Monday, his wife, the film producer Lauren Shuler Donner, told Deadline.\nHis first major break came with 1976's The Omen, and later produced Free Willy and The Lost Boys. \nSteven Spielberg, who wrote the story on which The Goonies was based, told Variety that Donner was \"gifted across so many genres\".\n\"Being in his circle was akin to hanging out with your favourite coach, smartest professor, fiercest motivator, most endearing friend, staunchest ally, and - of course - the greatest Goonie of all,\" Mr Spielberg said.\n\"He was all kid. All heart. All the time. I can't believe he's gone, but his husky, hearty laugh will stay with me always.\"\nBorn in the Bronx, New York, Donner started in television in the early 1960s, with credits including anthology series The Twilight Zone and spy thriller The Man From Uncle.\nBut it wasn't until the mid-1970s that he made his mark on Hollywood. His work on 1978's Superman starring Christopher Reeve is often regarded as the first modern superhero film.\nDonner directed and produced The Goonies in 1985. The comedy tells the story of a group of children hunting for a hidden treasure, and has become a cult classic. \nMany have taken to social media to pay tribute to Donner.\nActor Mel Gibson, who starred in Donner's Lethal Weapon movies as well as Conspiracy Theory, told Variety that Donner was \"magnanimous of heart and soul, which he liberally gave to all who knew him.\"\n\"If we piled up all the good deeds he did, it would stretch to some uncharted place in the firmament. I will sorely miss him, with all his mischievous wit and wisdom,\" he said. "

      "tags": "Schools",
      "text": "Covid rules that have seen hundreds of thousands of pupils miss out on learning due to self-isolation are being axed in England, it is confirmed.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the system of sending \"bubbles\" of children home after a positive case would cease at the end of summer term.  \nThe bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he said.\nTeaching unions warned against easing rules as cases are still rising.\nThe changes to schools guidance will take effect at the same time as the country eases restrictions and moves to stage four. This is expected to be on 19 July - with confirmation of this due next Monday. \nHowever, some schools break up a few days before that.\nThe need for face masks, social distancing measures and staggered start and finish times in schools will be scrapped from September, Mr Williamson said.\nThe Covid testing regime for pupils will be transferred to the NHS track and trace system, Mr Williamson said.\nInstead, secondary schools will be asked to offer pupils two Covid tests at the beginning of the autumn term, as a one-off event.\nThe changes were announced as the latest official statistics for England show the number of pupils out and self-isolating due to Covid hit a record high of 641,000 pupils.  \nOnly 28,000 of these had a confirmed case of Covid-19. \nMr Williamson told the Commons: \"Keeping children in consistent groups was essential to control the spread of the virus when our population was less vaccinated.\n\"We recognise that the system of bubbles and isolation is causing disruption to many children's education. \n\"That is why we'll be ending bubbles and transferring contact tracing to the NHS Test and Trace system for early years settings, schools and colleges.\"\nDepartment for Education figures show that in the autumn term (2020), some 33 million days of school were missed by pupils observing Covid isolation rules.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced that from 16 August under 18s would not have to isolate unless they themselves had tested positive for Covid. \nThis will prevent large numbers of youngsters having to stay at home because they have been in contact with someone who has the virus.\nMr Williamson said: \"I do not think it is acceptable that children should face greater restrictions over and above those of wider society, especially since they have given up so much to keep older generations safe during this pandemic.\"\nHe said: \"Where there are outbreaks schools and colleges may be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and they will also work with local health teams as they currently do now.\n\"We're also setting out new rules that mean from the 16 August children will only need to isolate if they have tested positive for Covid-19.\"\nAlice is a student at Westhoughton High School in Bolton, one of the areas of the country most significantly impacted by Covid. \nShe has had to self-isolate three times this school year and says it has been very difficult to study at home.\n\"I'm really lucky because my mum's a teacher so she's been able to help me on some things, but I've been struggling on how to do the difficult work in isolation,\" says Alice.\n\"It was hard because you're not face-to-face with a teacher - when you're in class teachers can read your facial expressions and tell when you're struggling and they can come and work individually with you.\n\"But when you're at home you're kind of struggling on your own.\"\nAlice has also struggled not seeing her friends.\nShe says being in school is always the best option and makes her feel more confident about her GCSE study. \"I'm not worrying as much,\" she says.\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers, said it was unclear how the changes would prevent disruption from happening.\n\"Removing the requirement for pupils to self-isolate when they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive may well accelerate the spread of the virus in schools and cause even higher levels of disruption for pupils and teachers. \"\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this significant relaxation of measures would be greeted with some trepidation after the past 15 months.\nBut he added that it simply would not be fair to continue with the current controls which have \"blighted the lives of children and young people\", when the adult population was largely vaccinated.\nThe education secretary also said there would be no restrictions on in-person teaching and learning in universities as national restrictions are lifted.\nAnalysis: \nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondent\nThe latest huge increase in pupils being sent home shows the chaos threatening the end of term in England's schools.\nScrapping the bubble system and changing the rules about isolation is intended to reduce the disruption - because as this week's figures show, 96% of those at home because of Covid do not have Covid.\nThis is now about \"managing Covid\" next term rather than expecting it to disappear.\nThere is also another troubling issue revealed by these attendance figures. While more than 641,000 are off school for Covid-related issues there are almost as many again who are absent for other, mostly unexplained, reasons.\nThe non-Covid absence numbers are way higher than would usually be off sick - and it raises questions about whether families are keeping pupils off school or large numbers of children have effectively stopped attending.\nThe reasons, like the risks, are unknown but worrying. But it means more than 1.2 million children are missing from school."

The family decided to bury the sisters together, in a coffin decorated with pink and purple ribbons. They are among the youngest known victims of the collapse.\nThe family had lived on the eighth floor. Marcus Guara - a sales manager who raised money for a number of charities - was found first, two days after the collapse.

But they had not found any \"liveable spaces\".\n\"Unfortunately, we are not seeing anything positive,\" he told a press conference on Tuesday.\nRescue efforts are now being further slowed by high winds from Storm Elsa, which is approaching from the south.\n\"The wind is hampering the large cranes moving very heavy debris,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burket told reporters.\nMeanwhile, officials are investigating other tower blocks in the area for potential structural faults.\nWhat caused the 40-year-old Champlain Towers South to crumble remains unclear. A 2018 inspection, however, warned of \"major\" flaws in the original design.\nThe building association's board has said it will appoint an \"independent receiver... to oversee the legal and claims process\"."

I didn't know what to do. I just froze,\" she told BBC North West Tonight.\nShe said Sandlin, of Queens Promenade in Blackpool, started giving her money to put credit on her phone and would \"make me ring him\" and \"do awful things\" down the phone. \nMs McKell said it then \"escalated from there\" but she was too frightened and confused to tell anyone. \nMs McKell said when rumours of the abuse began to circulate she was urged to deny anything had happened and it was decided she could go on stage in the weeks Sandlin was not on the bill.\nShe said it was \"absolutely horrific\" that he was \"allowed to continue performing as if he hadn't done anything wrong and I was the problem that was removed\".\nWhen the show ended, Ms McKell never danced professionally again and said the trauma destroyed her life. \n\"My first blueprint of men has been shrouded in rape and manipulation and grooming and so I've struggled my whole life to trust men,\" she said.\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by the issues covered in the story, BBC Action Line has details of organisations offering help and support.\nHowever, after therapy almost two decades later Ms McKell decided to go to the police. \nDetectives approached her friend Hannah Gray, who danced with her in the troupe, and her teenage diaries corroborated Ms McKell's account. \nWhile she did not know of the abuse, passages of the diary were read out during a trial at Preston Crown Court and helped secure the conviction of Sandlin, who was described by Lancashire Police as \"predatory and dangerous\".\nHe was jailed last week after a jury found him guilty of one count of rape and two counts of indecent assault.\nDet Con Adam Weaver said Sandlin \"used a position of trust to exploit the victim, then 15, before committing several horrific sexual attacks\".\nMs McKell said when the verdict was read out she felt \"an utter release from my body\". \n\"I have been believed and I thought 'it's done, it's over. I can move on',\" she said.\nMs McKell said she now wanted to remove \"the shame attached to sexual assault and being a sexual assault victim\" and encourage other victims to speak out.\n\"I never thought we'd get a conviction but by the powers of the investigation, who did an incredible job, it just grew legs,\" she said. \n\"There's no DNA evidence. No-one saw us. It's 20 years ago. And yet, still we've done it. \n\"So to anyone thinking it might not be worth it, even if it doesn't get to court, you've had your truth heard. And that's so important.\n\"He no longer controls my life. I've taken back control. And that's amazing.\"\nMs McKell has also had an emotional reunion with her friend Ms Gray after Sandlin's sentencing.\n\"I'm so sorry because we just didn't know what had happened to you at that time and now I know and I'm really, really sorry,\" Ms Gray told her.\nMs McKell told her she had no need to apologise and thanked her for supporting her through the investigation and handing over her diaries.\nA spokesman for Legends said it did not produce the show in 2002 and had no knowledge of the abuse until police contacted them in 2020 but had fully co-operated with the investigation.\nThe producer of the 2002 show said no abuse was reported to him and that if it had been, anyone involved would have been suspended and the police notified immediately. \nYou can watch Kirsty McKell's full story on BBC North West Tonight at 18:30 BST on Tuesday 6 July or watch afterwards on the iPlayer.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Because living on the street is the worst.\"\nThis time, she's in accommodation run by a charity called Housing for Women. Letitia says without it, she would \"absolutely\" be on the streets again.\nThe charity has two houses in London, geared specifically to help female prisoners who have recently left custody. One provides supported accommodation for women leaving prison dealing with substance abuse, and the other offers practical help to women reconnecting with the children after being in  custody.\nFor Letitia, who has two daughters, it's a life saver. \n\"My daughter's of an age where she said \"Mum, I am not sure I want to see you',\" she says.\n\"It knocked me for six. If I'd been out in the community and not been here, I don't think I would have got through that.\"\nIn January, the government announced \u00a370 million to keep prison leavers off the streets, including \u00a320 million for a new accommodation service that will house former prisoners for up to 12 weeks. \nBut campaigners say it will be rolled out in fewer than half of the probation regions across England and Wales. \nCampaigners also say it does not deal with many vulnerable women's needs, which include being relocated away from where they have been victims of domestic violence, or to be rehoused with their children. \n\"A lack of safe, supported and permanent accommodation puts vulnerable women at risk and makes it near impossible for them to turn their lives around\", the MPs' letter says.\nThey are also calling for designated officers to act as \"brokers\" for housing in every women's prison.\nPrisoners are currently given a so-called \"discharge grant\" of \u00a346 to cover travel and food on release, a rate set more than 25 years ago. Ministers have promised to raise that to \u00a376 in the summer. \nA government spokesman said: \"Having a safe and secure place to stay reduces reoffending, which is why we provide temporary accommodation on release and have invested \u00a3200 million in rehabilitation support, including specialist women's services.\"  "

      "text": "Covid rules that have seen hundreds of thousands of pupils miss out on learning due to self-isolation are being axed in England, it is confirmed.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the system of sending \"bubbles\" of children home after a positive case would cease at the end of summer term.  \nThe bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he said.\nTeaching unions warned against easing rules as cases are still rising.\nThe changes to schools guidance will take effect at the same time as the country eases restrictions and moves to stage four. This is expected to be on 19 July - with confirmation of this due next Monday. \nHowever, some schools break up a few days before that.\nThe need for face masks, social distancing measures and staggered start and finish times in schools will be scrapped from September, Mr Williamson said.\nThe Covid testing regime for pupils will be transferred to the NHS track and trace system, Mr Williamson said.\nInstead, secondary schools will be asked to offer pupils two Covid tests at the beginning of the autumn term, as a one-off event.\nThe changes were announced as the latest official statistics for England show the number of pupils out and self-isolating due to Covid hit a record high of 641,000 pupils.  \nOnly 28,000 of these had a confirmed case of Covid-19. \nMr Williamson told the Commons: \"Keeping children in consistent groups was essential to control the spread of the virus when our population was less vaccinated.\n\"We recognise that the system of bubbles and isolation is causing disruption to many children's education. \n\"That is why we'll be ending bubbles and transferring contact tracing to the NHS Test and Trace system for early years settings, schools and colleges.\"\nDepartment for Education figures show that in the autumn term (2020), some 33 million days of school were missed by pupils observing Covid isolation rules.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced that from 16 August under 18s would not have to isolate unless they themselves had tested positive for Covid. \nThis will prevent large numbers of youngsters having to stay at home because they have been in contact with someone who has the virus.\nMr Williamson said: \"I do not think it is acceptable that children should face greater restrictions over and above those of wider society, especially since they have given up so much to keep older generations safe during this pandemic.\"\nHe said: \"Where there are outbreaks schools and colleges may be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and they will also work with local health teams as they currently do now.\n\"We're also setting out new rules that mean from the 16 August children will only need to isolate if they have tested positive for Covid-19.\"\nAlice is a student at Westhoughton High School in Bolton, one of the areas of the country most significantly impacted by Covid. \nShe has had to self-isolate three times this school year and says it has been very difficult to study at home.\n\"I'm really lucky because my mum's a teacher so she's been able to help me on some things, but I've been struggling on how to do the difficult work in isolation,\" says Alice.\n\"It was hard because you're not face-to-face with a teacher - when you're in class teachers can read your facial expressions and tell when you're struggling and they can come and work individually with you.\n\"But when you're at home you're kind of struggling on your own.\"\nAlice has also struggled not seeing her friends.\nShe says being in school is always the best option and makes her feel more confident about her GCSE study. \"I'm not worrying as much,\" she says.\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers, said it was unclear how the changes would prevent disruption from happening.\n\"Removing the requirement for pupils to self-isolate when they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive may well accelerate the spread of the virus in schools and cause even higher levels of disruption for pupils and teachers. \"\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this significant relaxation of measures would be greeted with some trepidation after the past 15 months.\nBut he added that it simply would not be fair to continue with the current controls which have \"blighted the lives of children and young people\", when the adult population was largely vaccinated.\nThe education secretary also said there would be no restrictions on in-person teaching and learning in universities as national restrictions are lifted.\nAnalysis: \nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondent\nThe latest huge increase in pupils being sent home shows the chaos threatening the end of term in England's schools.\nScrapping the bubble system and changing the rules about isolation is intended to reduce the disruption - because as this week's figures show, 96% of those at home because of Covid do not have Covid.\nThis is now about \"managing Covid\" next term rather than expecting it to disappear.\nThere is also another troubling issue revealed by these attendance figures. While more than 641,000 are off school for Covid-related issues there are almost as many again who are absent for other, mostly unexplained, reasons.\nThe non-Covid absence numbers are way higher than would usually be off sick - and it raises questions about whether families are keeping pupils off school or large numbers of children have effectively stopped attending.\nThe reasons, like the risks, are unknown but worrying. But it means more than 1.2 million children are missing from school."

      "text": "Scotland is still on track to see Covid restrictions lifted next month, the Scottish government has said. \nFinance Secretary Kate Forbes said the plan was for Scotland to move to level zero on 19 July, with remaining legal restrictions lifted on 9 August.\nMs Forbes said the data would be closely monitored, after it was revealed that Scotland has the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nMost of England's Covid restrictions are due to end on 19 July.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that in England face masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrapped. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Forbes said many restrictions would be eased as planned in Scotland too - despite the record high number of Covid cases reported in recent weeks. \nHowever, she said some measures, such as the wearing of face coverings, would remain in place in Scotland. \n\"We expect some baseline measures - for example face masks, some limitations on working from home and so on - will continue for a longer period of time,\" she said.  \n\"We are lifting the limits and lifting as much of the legal restrictions as possible. So that means physical distancing, it means the attendee caps on, for example, life events like weddings or being in stadiums and that kind of thing. \n\"But we do think that there will still be some baseline measures, for example, the wearing of face masks which will continue for a longer period of time.\" \nShe said the virus was still with us, and that we were at a \"fragile moment\" in the pandemic. \nAlthough the virus is still highly contagious, the link between transmission and hospitalisation has been weakened but not broken completely, she said. \nThe finance secretary added that the data was being closely monitored, and that the plans for what will be lifted on 19 July would be unveiled on 13 July.   \nScotland's exit from lockdown is following the same pattern as much of the rest of the pandemic.\nThe rhetoric from politicians in Edinburgh is notably more cautious than that of their counterparts in London, but ultimately they are all traveling on the same path.\nWords like \"irreversible\" and \"guarantee\" are absent, but ministers still bat away any question of delaying their plans or re-imposing any restrictions.\nAnd while there is talk of retaining \"mitigations\" like face coverings, it remains unclear whether this will be a legal requirement, or simply guidance - and thus in effect no different to plans down south.\nThere is a particular challenge for politicians, who are pulled in different directions by the complexities of the pandemic and managing the public's expectations as well as their behaviour.\nThe Scottish government has developed a reputation as a careful, canny operation - but ministers also apparently feel compelled to lift restrictions despite case numbers hitting record highs.\nAnd the opposition Scottish Conservatives are in a similarly curious bind, finding themselves stressing how awful the situation is - while insisting that ministers continue with the current plan.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' Douglas Ross said it was time to learn to live with the virus, and called for restrictions to be eased as planned in the weeks ahead. \nHe told Good Morning Scotland: \"People die from a number of ailments all the time. And we have to learn to live with Covid-19. It's going to be with us going forward and I think it is time to start to get our lives back to normal as much as possible.\"\nHe said there were other harms caused by Covid restrictions. \n\"We are also seeing people during this pandemic dying from cancer - because they weren't diagnosed in time, or couldn't get their treatment, or they didn't feel they were able to go and see their doctor or get an appointment at hospital over the last 16 months,\" he said.\n\"We cannot simply say we are going to keep lockdown to stop people dying from Covid if they are suffering or dying of other illnesses.\" \nOn whether people should continue to be mandated to wear face masks, Mr Ross said it should be a personal decision. \n\"I think that is a personal decision and one that is perfectly acceptable,\" he said.  \nOn Monday, there were 2,372 new cases of Covid confirmed in Scotland. Last week saw the most Covid-19 cases than at any point during the pandemic, with a peak of 4,234 new infections recorded on 1 July.\nThe national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, attributed this to a lack of \"natural immunity\" in the population. \nHe said Scotland had been hit hard by the more infectious Delta variant becoming \"seeded\" in Glasgow. \nProf Leitch also linked the surge in part to people gathering to watch Euro 2020 matches.\nHowever, he said hospital admissions and deaths were not rising at the same rates they were earlier in the pandemic - because of the protection offered by vaccination.\nHe added that a \"big wave\" of Covid infections, fuelled by the Delta strain, was likely to overtake other parts of Europe in the weeks ahead."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. \nIts approach reflects that of many firms which do not plan to ask staff to return full time to the office after current government guidance changes.\nCurrently people who can work from home are being asked to continue to do so, but this is set to end on 19 July.\nMany office workers have worked predominantly from home since the first lockdown in March last year. \nFrom 19 July, it is expected to be up to employers to determine whether their staff should be in the office.\nSince the pandemic, 5% of the Bank of England's 4,000 staff have been coming into the office.\nIts chief operating officer and deputy governor, Joanna Place, said a recent survey of Bank staff showed that the majority hope to continue to work from home for at least two days a week.\n\"In this spirit, the governors and I have established a set of trial guidelines - and which we are positioning as a pilot - which encourage more flexible working and only ask that our colleagues return to the office at least once per week for 'team days'.\"\nThe Bank said it would not instigate this system until September. \nMs Place said time and physical presence with teams was important and she expected that staff would eventually average about three-four days in the office, with one to two days working from home. \nMajor commercial banks are adopting different working approaches. Goldman Sachs has told staff to be ready to return to the workplace in July, whereas NatWest's new working model could see just 13% of staff in the office full-time.\nThe Centre for Cities think tank said the number of people back in their place of work across the UK's largest towns and cities was still just a quarter of what it was pre-pandemic.\nPaul Swinney from Centre for Cities said the lack of people working in offices had been a \"real challenge\" for shops, cafes and pubs who used to depend on office workers for business. \n\"The change to the 'back to the office' advice will doubtless be good news for them, but a question mark remains over how many workers will return now restrictions have lifted,\" he said.\nAdvertising business Havas Creative used to have 1,800 staff in its central London office.\nChief executive, Chris Hirst, told the BBC he had changed his view about home and office working: \"Last April I would have said we need to get everyone back into the office as quickly as we can. I don't think that's the case any more.\n\"I do think that we will move to a hybrid working model and that could and should be to the benefit of both employers and employees.\n\"I hope we will get to a place in September where we have all of the people [in the office] some of the time.\"\nDavid Abrahamovitch, founder of Grind coffee shops, said the relaxation on office-working rules was \"very much welcomed\".\nHe previously said the four-week delay to restrictions ending \"killed the summer\" for his London-based coffee shops, which rely on commuters for business. \n\"We are looking forward to seeing more people back in the city,\" he said. \"I hope lots of companies will follow the lead of those such as Apple and mandate a return to the office for at least three days per week.\"\nAlmost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers previously told the BBC they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time.\nSome 43 of the firms said they would embrace so-called hybrid working, a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week.\nPeter Cheese, chief executive of the CIPD, said a return to the office should be \"down to individual organisations consulting with their people to agree working arrangements\".\n\"'Freedom Day' shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces, but it could signal the start of greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work,\" he added.\n\"Businesses shouldn't rush to simply revert to how they used to work, now we have experience and evidence that it can be done differently,\" he said.\nAlistair Elliott, a senior partner at Knight Frank, said the estate agent \"wholeheartedly\" welcomed the lifting of working from home guidance.\n\"While this was imperative at the beginning of the pandemic, we look forward to seeing our great towns and cities fill up again, bringing all the benefits that the best collaborative workplaces create,\" he added.\nRichard Burge, chief executive of London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said businesses would welcome being able to increase their capacity or \"kickstart their chosen future ways of working plans\".\n\"For London this is all hugely significant and is a further placing of the 'open for business' sign on the front door,\" he added.  \n\"Ultimately, the answer is yes\" - your employer can tell you to work from the office, according to Shah Qureshi, partner and head of employment at law firm Irwin Mitchel.\nHowever, Mr Qureshi adds that under the Health and Safety at Work Act, \"employers have an obligation to ensure that there is a safe working environment, a safe workplace, to which an employee returns\", which is irrespective of whether restrictions are abolished on 19 July.\nSo although all coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July, measures put in place by companies could still include spacing desks out, enforcing one-way walking systems and ensuring adequate sanitary facilities, to make sure their offices are safe. \n\"There is an obligation to return to the office where an employer requires you to do so, and your normal workplace is the office, but there is a duty of care that the employer has to ensure that everything is safe as far as possible,\" said Mr Qureshi.\nMr Qureshi added that as the law currently stands, there is no legal right for employees to work from home."

      "text": "A teenage boy has been convicted of murdering his 12-year-old friend after luring him to woodland and attempting to decapitate him.\nRoberts Buncis was found dead in the Fishtoft area of Boston on 12 December.\nHe had been stabbed more than 70 times in a \"brutal and prolonged\" attack and had suffered wounds \"consistent with an attempt to remove the head\".\nA 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, was found guilty after a trial at Lincoln Crown Court.\nThe court heard the defendant \"intended at the very least to inflict serious violence\" on his young victim because \"he was a snitch\".\nThe boy, who was 14 at the time of the attack, admitted manslaughter midway through his trial but denied murder.\nHowever, the jury of nine men and three women took less than two hours to convict him.\nRemanding the boy into custody, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said he would pass sentence at a later date, explaining to the defendant it was \"not a straightforward sentencing exercise\".\nThe court heard Roberts was found on ground off Alcorn Green two days before his 13th birthday.\nPathologist Prof Guy Rutty, who examined his body, said he had identified 22 sites of injury across the neck, chest and abdomen, some containing up to 17 separate injuries.\nAs well as an attempt to decapitate Roberts he said there were also injuries consistent with someone \"trying to remove the hand or fingers\".\nProsecutors said the defendant used such force the tip of the knife broke off and was later found embedded in Roberts' skull.\nGiving evidence, the defendant claimed he had met up with his friend to hand over a stash of drugs for him to sell, but began arguing when he did not receive the \u00a350 payment he was expecting.\nThe teenager claimed Roberts had taken the knife to the scene and he \"lost control\" when the youngster attempted to stab him.\nHe told the court he recalled stabbing his victim once in the neck, but did not remember 70 other blows.\nFollowing the attack, the court heard the defendant ran home and tried to hide the knife and burn the clothes and gloves he was wearing.\nHe later messaged a friend saying \"things went wrong\" and \"this wasn't supposed to go down like this\".\nProsecutor Mary Loram QC said the defendant had previously discussed a plan with Roberts to rob a shop in order to get money to set himself up as a drug dealer.\nBut, she said, Roberts described the proposal as \"too mad\" and refused to be involved.\nShe told the court the defendant apparently feared that Roberts would snitch on him.\nSpeaking after the trial, Det Ch Insp Richard Myszczyszyn, of East Midlands Special Operations Unit, described the killing as an \"utterly senseless act\".\n\"It's a tragedy that deeply affected the school and the local community, and one that will stay with all of us for a lifetime,\" he said.\n\"The level of violence, and that it involved children, makes it all the more difficult to comprehend.\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

Hospitalisations are now going up a little, but they're not at the levels they were in the first and second waves,\" he said.\n\"Intensive care is stable - [there are] really low numbers of Covid cases in intensive care.\"\nThe number of drop-in vaccination centres is being expanded from Monday after the sharp rise in Covid case numbers. \nAll mainland health boards are now offering drop-in clinics.\nEveryone aged 18 and over can attend for their first dose. People who had their a first jab at least eight weeks before can attend for a second dose. \nHowever, Scottish Labour has called for the gap between first and second vaccinations to be halved to four weeks.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said that would help deal with the \"out of control\" spread of coronavirus.\nMr Sarwar pointed to guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) which suggests that vaccines can be effective when the two doses are administered just four weeks apart.\nHe accused the Scottish government of being too slow on measures such as walk-in vaccination centres and contact tracing.\nIn response, a spokesman for Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said an eight-week gap was \"optimal\" according to advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and \"reducing that below eight weeks would compromise the effectiveness of the vaccine and how long that effect lasts\".\nHe added: \"We are progressing the final stages of our successful vaccine rollout as quickly as we can.\n\"This is limited by supply, we can only give Pfizer to younger age groups, in addition, constraints on supply affect the pool of those who had their first dose eight weeks previously.\"\nLast week saw the most Covid-19 cases than at any point during the pandemic, with a peak of 4,234 new infections recorded. on 1 July.\nAccording to the latest ONS infection survey figures, Scotland is believed to have the highest Covid rate in the UK, with estimated levels in the Scottish population 73% higher than in England, triple those in Wales and more than four times higher than those in Northern Ireland.\nThe Scottish government wants to move all parts of Scotland to level 0 on 19 July, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said would be \"a significant step back to normality\".\nIt expects to have completed second doses for all over-40s by 26 July.\nTwo weeks later - on 9 August - the major remaining legal Covid restrictions could be lifted."

      "text": "Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says.\nSajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date.\nThe government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added.\nMeanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announced the end of \"bubbles\" in schools from 19 July.\nThis system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test.\nCovid-related pupil absence in England has hit a new high since all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week.\nOn Monday, the prime minister confirmed he intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictions in England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing.\nA further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: \"From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated.\n\"If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms.\" \nAs under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them.\nMr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be \"advised\" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age.\nPeople identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nHe added that \"of course\" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers \"it makes sense\" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August.\nIt said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs.\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement \"doesn't go far enough, quickly enough\".\nChief executive Kate Nicholls said it \"fails to recognise the carnage the current system\" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who \"have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive\".\nThe NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move \"may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid\".\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing \"the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country\", Mr Javid said.\nEarlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be \"at least double\" what they were now \"so around 50,000 new cases a day\".\n\"As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,\" he said. \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK \"building a protective wall\" of vaccines. \nHowever, Mr Ashworth said the \"wall is only part built\", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people.\nHe said he \"understood the rationale\" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the \"biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy\" was a \"lack of financial incentive to stay at home\".\nHe also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: \"Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way.\"\nThe Scottish government has said it may continue to require masks in certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end.\nAhead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said people would need to learn to live with Covid.\nNorthern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless.\nShe said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would \"not be following that model\". \nIreland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan \"too risky\" and warned if things went wrong there would be a \"spillover effect\" into neighbouring countries.\nAsked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: \"Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place.\"\nThe lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves.\nNo other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant.\nSo, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether.\nIf cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter.\nSoon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000.\nThese are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to.\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could \"still cause some pressure to the health system\".\nHowever he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a \"slight gamble\" he thought it was \"justifiable\", adding \"I'm reasonably optimistic.\"\nHe said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. \"The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold.\"\nIn the worst-case scenario there \"may need to be a course correction later\", he added.\nBusinesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July.\nMelvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had \"got this right\", adding that \"the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen\". \nHe also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors.\nHowever, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still \"encourage guests\" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe."

      "text": "\"The only place for her that will keep her safe and secure is prison.\"\nFor Ellie, 22, from Cardiff, seeing her mum in the criminal justice system is not new - she was arrested \"something like 30 times\" last year alone.\nEx-offenders, experts and support services have all said Wales needs better rehabilitation services.\nThe Ministry of Justice said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds into rehabilitation services \"to help offenders turn their backs on crime\".\nEllie said her mother, who has been struggling with an alcohol addiction since Ellie was five years old, has been \"in and out of police cells for as long as I can remember\".\nShe believes that better support and rehabilitation services would help end this cycle of behaviour that many ex-offenders find themselves in, and wants her mother to \"be safe and get the right support\". \n\"I love my mum, after all she's my mum. I've prayed, wished, hoped everyday and begged everyone under the sun that I can possibly think of to fix her. The reality is, you can't fix the condition but you can improve it,\" she said.\nHer mother served her first short sentence in prison earlier this year after several run-ins with the authorities over the years.\nEllie said the \"immediate and focused support\" made a positive difference.\nOnce out of prison, her mother was put on a 15-week waiting list for therapy, which Ellie said was not good enough for somebody who needed help \"right now and right there.\"\nEllie said the best option would be for a controlled environment, similar to what prison provided, that her mum and others could afford to access.\n\"It's horrible to say and, of course, I wouldn't wish for her to be in prison, but the best place for my mum to be is not out on the streets, it's not out in a council flat, where she is given no support.\n\"Unfortunately, because of the system we are in, because of the situation we are in as a country, the only place for her that will keep her safe and secure is prison.\" \nEllie's mother - who spoke to BBC Wales and was happy to share her story - said better services were needed to avoid people like herself \"slipping through the net\", but was now getting access to support and advice.\nChris Leslie is a rehabilitated offender in Cardiff who now works as part of the team at Inside Out Support Wales to help others do the same.\nHe said it could be \"extremely difficult\" getting back into society, with even everyday tasks proving challenging.\nHe said: \"It's harder when you've been in a prison environment where you're around 300 people knowing everyone's name.\n\"Then all of a sudden you're in a supermarket with thousands of people and it can be daunting. You don't realise how much anxiety can be built up over the years.\" \nLatest figures show 37% of female offenders and 41% of male offenders in Cardiff re-offended when released from prison.\nChris said, without the support he received, he could have ended up in a very different situation, adding that some people return to crime \"because they go back to what they know best\".\nHe said support was available, but you had to \"seek it out because of how resources are stretched\".\n\"It would have been easy to slide back,\" he said. \"Without the support I've had, who knows where I'd be. \nBernie Bowen-Thompson, head of the charity Safer Wales, said more resources needed to be available for people leaving prison. \n\"To think someone feels better going back to prison because of a lack of services is absolutely awful,\" she said, adding that community-based services were vital.\n\"If you come out and you have unsecure accommodation, you've got debts, your mental health is poor, or trying to manage substance misuse, the cycle will continue. Unless we can get those fundamental needs that we all have, how do you move on?\"\nThe Ministry of Justice said it was planning to open \"the first residential women's centre in Wales which will focus on reducing reoffending and ultimately keep the public safe\".\nThe Welsh government said: \"We continue to press the Ministry of Justice for a new women's residential care centre in Wales, and will continue to work with them on its development. \n\"We want to improve outcomes for all women who come into contact with the criminal justice system in Wales.\"\nOffending doesn't happen in a vacuum. \nWhether it's substance misuse, domestic violence and trauma or poor mental health - many in the criminal justice system experience problems that lead to prison, but that prison alone cannot address. \nThe failure to tackle those issues creates a destructive cycle.  \nFourteen years after the Corston Report called for smaller custodial units for women - instead of prison - to tackle this issue, a 12-bed women's residential unit is finally being planned for Wales. \nResearch shows children are disproportionately affected when women are jailed, but effective rehabilitation and support in the community is vital if all offenders, regardless of gender, are to get their lives back on track.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Face masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrapped at the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap, Boris Johnson has confirmed.\nThe rule of six inside private homes will be removed and work-from-home guidance abolished as 16 months of on-off restrictions on daily life end.\nThe PM said he expected the final step would go ahead as planned on 19 July. \nThis will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data.\nFurther updates on school bubbles, travel and self-isolation will follow in the coming days, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference.\nHe said that even after the removal of the legal requirement to wear a face covering, he would continue to wear one himself in crowded places \"as a courtesy\".\nMr Johnson said the ability to end a vast majority of legal restrictions in England was thanks to the success of the vaccine rollout in weakening the link between cases and deaths.\nBut he warned cases were predicted to rise to 50,000 a day later this month and that \"we must reconcile ourselves, sadly, to more deaths from Covid\".\nThe prime minister explained: \"If we don't go ahead now when we've clearly done so much with the vaccination programme to break the link... when would we go ahead?\"\nHe added: \"We run the risk of either opening up at a very difficult time when the virus has an edge, has an advantage, in the cold months, or again putting everything off to next year.\"\nSelf-isolation orders for those who test positive would continue, Mr Johnson said, but he suggested there would soon be new rules for fully-vaccinated contacts.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs he would probably make an announcement regarding a new regime for close contacts on Tuesday.\nNo country in the world has attempted to lift restrictions like this - in the face of rapidly rising cases driven by the new, more infectious Delta variant.\nSome say it would be better to wait until autumn when all adults will have had the chance to get a second vaccine dose.\nThat may sound good in principle, but scientists advising government seem to be backing a summer lifting.\nUnlocking was always going to drive up infections. And the problem with trying to delay that is the risk of a surge in cases at a much worse time.\nBy the autumn schools will be back - and we can see the huge disruption the rise in cases in recent weeks has had.\nPeople will also be outdoors more in the summer months, which could help flatten the peak.\nBut perhaps most importantly you risk running into the flu season.\nThat is when the NHS is under most pressure, while a Covid infection followed by flu in quick succession puts the vulnerable even more at risk.\nThe move is not without risk. The government is banking on the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme stemming these rises soon.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules. \nThe Scottish government has said it may continue to require masks in certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end.\nAhead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said people would need to learn to live with Covid. Rules in Northern Ireland have just eased, with another review due on 8 July.\nThe final stage of England's roadmap, step four, was delayed last month to no earlier than 19 July amid surging virus cases linked to the Delta variant.\nMr Johnson said step four should proceed on that date, subject to the 12 July review. \nAnnouncing what the next stage of the pandemic will look like in England, he confirmed:\nIt means nightclubs will reopen for the first time since the pandemic began, while drinks at the bar will return in a boost to the hospitality industry.\nSocial distancing requirements, including the 1m-plus rule, have prevented many venues from operating at full capacity during the pandemic.\nFace coverings are currently required, for those without an exemption, on public transport and in shops as part of regulations backed by law.\nThe prime minister said that while Covid certificates to prove vaccination or test status would not be legally mandated, businesses could choose to require them.\nResponding to Mr Johnson's announcement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"lifting all protections in one go, when the infection rate is going up, is reckless\". \n\"A balanced approach or proper plan would say keep protections,\" he added, suggesting the use of masks in enclosed spaces and on public transport.\nSpeaking alongside Mr Johnson, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty outlined the three scenarios where he would continue to wear a face covering in the context of rising case numbers.\n\"The first is any situation which is indoors, crowded, or indoors with close proximity with other people... the second situation I'd do it is if I was required to by any competent authority... and the third reason is if someone else was uncomfortable if I did not wear a mask,\" he said.\nProf Whitty warned this coming winter \"may be very difficult for the NHS\", as chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the link between cases, hospital admission and death had been \"weakened, not broken\" by the vaccines.\nOn the vaccine roll-out, Mr Johnson said the gap between first and second vaccine jabs for the under-40s will be shortened from 12 weeks to eight.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson will announce more details on Tuesday about how schools will manage isolation in future, the prime minister added.\nBut he confirmed pupils will no longer be sent home en masse within so-called school bubbles.\nA further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, alongside another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

Others will still have to quarantine for 10 days, although this can be reduced with a negative test on the fifth day.\nThe prime minister's announcement around lifting many of the remaining coronavirus restrictions in England has sparked intense debate.

      "text": "More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers have fled to neighbouring Tajikistan after clashing with Taliban militants, officials have said.\nThe troops retreated over the border to \"save their own lives\", according to a statement by Tajikistan's border guard.\nViolence has risen in Afghanistan and the Taliban have been making significant gains, particularly in the north of the country, in recent weeks. \nThe surge comes as the US, UK and allies withdraw after 20 years.\nThe vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of a September deadline. There are concerns that the Afghan military, who were supposed to take over security in the country, will collapse.\nUnder a deal with the Taliban, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the militants not to allow any extremist group to operate in the areas they control.\nBut the Taliban did not agree to stop fighting Afghan forces, and now reportedly control about a third of the country.\nThe retreat is the third time Afghan soldiers have fled to Tajikistan over the past three days and the fifth case over the past fortnight.  In total, nearly 1,600 soldiers have crossed the border. \nThe latest group of Afghan troops sought refuge early on Monday morning after fighting with militants during the night, Tajikistan's National Security Committee said.\nBadakhshan and Takhar provinces, which border Tajikistan, have seen a rapid Taliban advance. \n\"The Taliban cut off all the roads and these people had nowhere to go but to cross the border,\" one senior Afghan official told Reuters on Monday.\nZabihullah Atiq, a parliamentarian from Badakhshan, said the troops had used various routes to flee. Tajik border guards said Afghan soldiers were being provided with shelter and food, but further details were not available. \nBy Kawoon Khamoosh, BBC News\nWith the new surge in violence across the country, Afghan forces are facing an unprecedented level of combat in the absence of foreign troops.\nGovernment officials have been tweeting non-stop to keep soldiers motivated by underlying their sacrifices. But much of the troops' motivation disappears amid news of retreat, collapse of key districts and casualties.\nMilitary officials in Kabul have talked about \"tactical retreat\" whenever insurgents made gains, but we hear from commanders in the battlefield about a lack of ammunition, and delays in sending support.\nIn Badakhshan province, where the government lost significant territory in recent days, local sources say many government officials \"escaped\" to Kabul way before Taliban attacks.\nNot only can this dishearten soldiers, but it also raises the bigger question of the loyalty of high-ranking officials in peace talks. Will political leaders - whose families already reside abroad - remain in the country if full-scale civil war erupts?\nPresident Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have also been reports of more soldiers seeking refuge in Pakistan and Uzbekistan to escape the fighting.\nNeighbouring countries are bracing themselves for a potential influx of refugees if the fighting continues to intensify.\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight.\nFor the people of Afghanistan, it is a worrying time, says Lyse Doucet, the BBC's chief international correspondent. The Taliban, who have been accused of various human rights and cultural abuses, support Islamic punishments - such as public executions of convicted murderers - as well as banning television, music and cinema, and disapproving of girls over 10 going to school. \n\"They are uncertain about uncertain about their own lives and the futures of their families,\" she says.\nZahra, a 25-year-old resident of Kabul, is among those concerned about the future.\n\"People are expecting a wider than ever war. A lot of people in Kabul fear that the Taliban might reach us at any time,\" she told BBC OS on World Service radio. \nJamshid, a student at Kabul University, said he did not plan to stay in the country if the Taliban took power. \nThere are also growing concerns about how to protect diplomatic missions in Afghanistan. \nRussia on Monday announced that it had temporarily suspended operations at its consulate in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif because of the deteriorating security situation. Envoy Zamir Kabulov said Afghan troops had surrendered too many districts, making the situation unstable. \nTurkey and Iran have also suspended operations in the city, moving diplomats to Kabul, according to reports. \nUS-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually regained enough strength to seize territory again.\nThe Taliban entered direct talks with the US in 2018, and President Joe Biden has said the American pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure Afghanistan cannot become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West again.\nHowever, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai told the BBC he believed the Nato and US military mission there had failed in defeating terrorism and extremism. \nHe called on both the Afghan government and the Taliban to \"sit down and talk as soon as possible for peace\".

      "text": "A man who stabbed two sisters at random in a supposed demonic pact - a \"sacrifice\" he seemingly believed would enable him to win the lottery - has been found guilty of their murder.\nDanyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman at Fryent Country Park in Wembley on 6 June 2020.\nHe repeatedly stabbed them after a birthday party for Ms Henry.\nTheir bodies were found there by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police.\nThe Old Bailey heard how the sisters had been with a small group of friends to celebrate Ms Henry's 46th birthday.\nWhen the others left they decided to stay as they were enjoying themselves. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced, the trial heard.\nAfter they failed to make it home, loved ones went back to the park to search for them and two days later found the women's sunglasses and a knife.\nAdam Stone, 27-year-old Ms Smallman's partner, then discovered the two bodies intertwined in the undergrowth while he was on the phone to the police.\nIn a victim impact statement read out in court, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: \"No-one expects their children to die before them but to have two of your three children murdered overnight is just incomprehensible.\n\"If any good comes out of this, at least another four women will not meet a similar end in a so-called pact with a so-called demon.\"\nIt can be reported for the first time that Hussein had previously been referred by his school to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent.\nIn October 2017, aged 15, he was referred to the de-radicalisation scheme because of content he had accessed on school computers, including far-right material. \nHussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult.\nHe was put on the \"Channel programme\" - for the most concerning Prevent cases - which discharged him in 2018, although he was seen again six and 12 months later.\nChannel involves a multi-agency panel responsible for assessing the risk posed by a referred person. The programme is then charged with developing a support plan for the individual concerned.\nDuring the trial, the jury heard Ms Henry had been stabbed eight times and Ms Smallman 28 times.\nHussein also cut himself during the attack and it was DNA evidence found at the crime scene that connected him to the murders.\nNearly a month after the deaths, a DNA familial link was made by police to Hussein's father, who had a past caution, and officers raided the defendant's home.\nIn his bedroom, they found three lottery tickets folded inside a letter signed in blood. In it, Hussein promised to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot.\nOver the 10 days following the killings, he spent more than \u00a3160 on lottery tickets and bets, all without success.\nIn another note found in his room, Hussein offered blood to \"demon Queen Byleth\" in exchange for making a girl at his school fall in love with him.\nThe jury heard blood found in the park was a billion times more likely to have come from the teenage suspect than anyone else, while CCTV footage showed him buying a set of knives from Asda the day before the killings.\nFollowing his arrest he told police he had Asperger's syndrome and trouble with his memory, but then refused to answer any questions.\nHussein did not give evidence during the trial but denied he was the person who carried out the killings.\nAs well as being convicted of two counts of murder, he was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon.\nThe 19-year-old is due to be sentenced on 22 September.\nMrs Justice Whipple ordered psychiatric reports to be carried out ahead of sentencing. She told the defendant he faced a long prison term.\nDet Ch Insp Simon Harding, the senior investigating officer, described the case as \"one of the most shocking and chilling\" he had dealt with.\nHe said the two victims \"had lots of friends and lived life to the full\", while footage taken by them on the night they died showed \"their bond and shared pleasure in being in each other's company\".\nThe senior officer also described Hussein as an \"arrogant\" and \"evil\" killer who had acted as a \"belligerent child\" in court.\n\"He has behaved like a teenage boy but he has committed some of the most savage crimes we have seen for many years,\" he said.\nTwo Met Police officers, PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 32, have been charged with misconduct in public office for taking \"non-official and inappropriate photographs\" of the murder scene. \nThe pair, who are both suspended from duty, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 July to enter a plea formally.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is carrying out a separate inquiry into how the Met handled calls from worried relatives and friends of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry before their bodies were discovered."

How is that to be caught back up? How is that going to impact him in the future?\n\"If the way it's done for the next academic year is the same, then what's to stop it happening again, then this is going to snowball.\"\nMr Hebditch says the emphasis needs to change in September from sending them home \"just in case\" to \"keep children in school\".  \n\"Rather than being like it is now, which seems to be to isolate for the protection of the wider community.\"\nHe says children should only be sent home if they have symptoms or test positive for Covid."

There is nothing here about imposing caps on second homes. And there is nothing here about bringing numbers of holiday homes into community ownership through public intervention.\n\"In fact, there is no detail just vague plans for more consultation,\" he added.\nResearch by Gwynedd council suggests that over 60% of people in the area are priced out of their local communities, with second homes making up 11% of the county's housing stock.\nCouncil leader Dyfrig Siencyn, a Plaid councillor, said: \"Consultations and pilot schemes will not assist young people keen to get onto the housing ladder this year, it is therefore exasperating to see that no direct immediate action will be made to support people now.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid  has set out plans for the end of self isolation for double-vaccinated people in England if they come into contact with an infected person. The measure - being introduced from 16 August - will also apply to under-18s even if they haven't had a jab. Currently, people in contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have to isolate for up to 10 days. On Monday, the prime minister confirmed he intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictions in England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing. But as this piece on pubs, public transport, and other businesses makes clear - it's not the end of masks just yet.\nThe system of sending \"bubbles\" of children home after a positive Covid case is being axed in England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has confirmed. He said it would cease at the end of summer term. The bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he told MPs. Teaching unions have warned against easing rules as cases are still rising. The changes were announced as the latest official statistics for England show the number of pupils who missed school last week to Covid hit a record high of 641,000. Only 28,000 of these had a confirmed case of Covid-19.\nThe Bank of England has said it will ask staff to come in to the office a minimum of once a week from September. Its approach reflects that of many firms which do not plan to ask staff to return full time to the office after current government guidance changes. Currently people who can work from home are being asked to continue to do so, but this is set to end on 19 July. Many office workers have worked predominantly from home since the first lockdown in March last year.\n\"The girls just wanted to know why their brothers could be educated but they're made to go to kitchens.\" During the coronavirus pandemic, Devanshi Ranjan has taught over 1,000 children, mainly girls, who weren't able to access education across the slums of New Delhi in India. For her efforts, the 21-year-old won the Diana Award, set up in memory of Princess Diana to honour young people who work to improve the lives of others. Read her story.\nIn the eyes of the artist, they're as shocking as a dead animal or a diamond-studded skull - and they say as much about life and death. Dozens of oil paintings of cherry blossom by Damien Hirst are going on public view for the first time this week, in Paris. The new exhibition, at the Fondation Cartier, delayed twice because of Covid restrictions, brings together around a third of the 100 canvases painted by Hirst, including during long periods working alone during lockdown, without his team of assistants.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "The mother of a boy who suffers life-threatening seizures says she is devastated at Nicola Sturgeon's response to her son's plea to make medicine available to his brother.\nKaren Gray's eight-year-old son Murray had hundreds of seizures a day before taking the cannabis-based drug Bedrolite, bought from the Netherlands.\nThe drug costs \u00a31,300 per month on private prescription.\nMurray's brother Dean, 13, wrote to Ms Sturgeon asking for help to pay for it.\nHowever, the first minister has now responded saying medication has to be proven to be safe before it will be available on the NHS.\nMs Gray, from Edinburgh, says the SNP leader's letter was disappointing and does not help Murray.\nShe told BBC News: \"We are delighted and grateful that the first minister took the time to write to us - it did seem like a very personal letter.\n\"But it's infuriating because she is saying about safety and the NHS won't prescribe the medicine, but the NHS is prescribing the very same cannabis oil to two other children in the UK.\"\nMurray suffers from a severe, complex epilepsy called Doose Syndrome. He had multiple seizures every day and his anti-epilepsy medication caused serious side-effects.\nMs Gray said: \"Murray was basically dying in front of us in hospital and the NHS couldn't do anything.\n\"The only way to take the cannabis oil legally was to get a private neurologist. She writes the prescription because she knows it's safe for Murray. He hasn't had a seizure in two years and no side-effects.\"\nSince legalisation in 2018, only three medical cannabis products have been licensed by the UK-wide Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nThese are Sativex, which is used to treat severe spasticity in MS patients, Nabilone for chemotherapy-induced nausea, and Epidyolex for rare forms of childhood epilepsy. Only Epidyolex can be prescribed by the NHS in Scotland.\nMurray initially responded to Epidyolex but his mother said it eventually stopped working. She believes this is because it did not contain THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.\nMs Gray hoped the first minister would help the family get Bedrolite prescribed on the NHS or help to find funding for it.\nBut Ms Sturgeon replied: \"For doctors to make decisions about which medicines to prescribe for their patients, they need to know that the medicines they are prescribing are safe to use.\n\"In order to prescribe medicines like those Murray currently takes on the NHS in Scotland (which means they will be dispensed for free), we need stronger evidence on their safety and use than we currently have. \n\"Just now, specialist doctors in the NHS who treat children with epilepsy and similar medical conditions aren't confident about prescribing cannabis oils, including Bedrolite, until there is better evidence available following a clinical trial.\"\nShe said that the Scottish government had encouraged the manufacturer to take part in future clinical trials of these medicines.\nSince taking Bedrolite, Murray's life has changed dramatically.\nHis mother said: \"Before, we were constantly in hospital with him, he was in a wheelchair and he was wearing a protective helmet. \n\"Now, he is able to go to school full-time, he runs about. He is having no seizures and no side-effects, when he was having loads of side-effects with all the anti-epileptic drugs that he was given.\"\nShe added: \"It's just infuriating that there are children in the UK being prescribed the exact same cannabis oil that Murray takes through the NHS. It's just not fair at all.\"\nMurray's private prescription costs the family \u00a31,300 a month, which they rely on friends and family to raise.\nMs Gray fears there will come a time when they cannot afford it.\nShe said she planned to reply to the first minister to explain the situation further.\nPeter Carroll is director of the End Our Pain campaign which is lobbying MPs for financial help for families paying out thousands of pounds on private prescriptions. \nHe said: \"It is touching the first minister replied to Dean's letter but frustrating that it didn't address the point.\n\"Families like Karen's have proved beyond doubt that the medication is life-transforming. If the issue is safety, then Karen has the best evidence it is safe. \n\"Our appeal is that now is the time to cut across the bureaucracy and give these families some money to pay for private prescriptions while they work on more widespread prescribing.\""

      "tags": "Easyjet,Center Parcs,British Airways,Air travel,Ryanair,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "From Monday 19 July the government has said wearing face coverings in England will be recommended but not mandatory. \nIt says bus and train companies must now decide whether passengers have to continue to wear face coverings, with rules being replaced by government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services.\nSome airlines have already confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July, while other businesses, including shops, pubs and hairdressers, are setting out updated policies. \nSo, following government confirmation of the easing of rules, what are businesses' intentions?\nMartin Dalby chief executive of Center Parcs said masks would be encouraged for both staff and customers in the indoor sections of its holiday parks.\n\"The approach from Center Parcs will be to recommend that both our employees and our customers do wear face coverings when in indoor settings - that's the advice we're going to give them.\" But he added: \"It's not mandatory and we won't be policing it.\"'\nHe also said they would not be asking for a Covid passport, proving vaccination status. \nClive Watson, chief executive of the City Pub Group, which has 45 pubs across the south of England and Wales, has said masks will be encouraged after 19 July and as much table service as possible will continue: \"We don't want a free-for-all scrum at the bar, loads of people queuing up.\"\nStaff will also be encouraged to continue to wear masks. \nHowever, Chris Jowsey, chief executive of Admiral Taverns, which has 1,000 pubs, has said the lifting of all restrictions is \"long overdue\". He adds that 19 July will \"be critical for the future of our industry, supporting community hubs across the UK and allowing businesses to operate as normal once again\".\nThe boss of the Timpson shoe repair and key cutting chain, Sir John Timpson, says he will leave mask wearing as a matter of personal choice for his customers: \"I don't think the way it's going we've got any right, we shouldn't expect them to do so, that's entirely up to the customer.\" \nBut he said his staff would be asked to wear masks.\n\"We will certainly advise them that what they should be doing as far as masks are concerned is to do the right thing to look after our customers - and that means wearing a mask when customers are within the shop.\n\"The wearing of masks is not mainly to protect yourself, it is to protect other people, and I think that we've still got to do that even though there's no legal requirement to do so.\" \nShop workers union Usdaw had previously urged the government not to lift Covid safety measures in shops. \n\"Retail staff are working with the public every day and are deeply worried about catching Covid-19,\" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary.\n\"This is not the right time to water down safety in stores and the government should not be removing the requirements for face coverings and distancing in busy public areas like shops.\"\nSainsbury's boss Simon Roberts has said mask wearing in stores will be a matter of \"personal choice\" after 19 July. And the Westfield shopping centre group has said it will \"encourage\" customers to wear masks. \nThe focus on masks is disproportionate to the impact they can have. Retaining mask-wearing is not going to significantly alter the course of the rising infections.\nThe fact remains the most important measure is for people to isolate when ill.\nInstead, the debate is symbolic of a wider issue - the importance of communication and messaging.\nThere's real frustration among government scientists about the mixed messaging coming out on masks as they fear it gives the impression we no longer need to be careful.\nThat's not true because how quickly normal behaviour returns - and that means everything from ditching masks and returning to the office as well as clubbing - makes a big difference to the summer wave.\nAn immediate return to normal could make the peak of hospital admissions twice as high as a more gradual return.\nThe modellers believe this is much more important than delaying the lifting of restrictions, which will have very limited impact on the peak.\nIt's why England's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing the need to go slowly with the new freedoms - and why the way mask-wearing is communicated is crucial.\nLesley Blair, chair of the British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology (BABTAC), a membership organisation and insurance provider for professionals working in the industry, would like mask wearing to continue. Ms Blair says that the organisation will encourage members to consider the the evidence as part of their risk assessments and continue to wear them \"especially when working in the breathing zone\". \nAmong smaller businesses, Joe Hemmings, who owns two hairdressers in Bristol, says he'll be taking a staged approach to mask wearing: \"To go from all of the PPE to nothing overnight is too radical for the sheer fact of peoples' anxiety and the need for precaution.\" \nEight of his 17 staff are aged about 30 and won't have had their second jab by 19 July. \"We need to make sure we can do everything we can to protect the team,\" he says.  \nIf customers refuse to wear a mask, Mr Hemmings says \"it's a tricky one\" but he'll \"have to honour\" their decision. \"We'd like to think it is everyone's best interest for us all to wear them inside,\" he adds.  \nRyanair has said masks will be mandatory, regardless of the departing destination. A spokesperson added that this was in keeping with current guidance from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\nBritish Airways has also said it sees no reason yet to change its existing rules, requiring staff and customers to wear masks, but said it was keeping its policies under constant review.\nEasyJet and Virgin have also told customers that passengers should continue to wear them.\nPassengers flying with Jet2 will not be allowed to board their flight without a face mask, unless they have previously given a reason for not wearing one.\nThe Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said some of the 3.8 million people classed as clinically vulnerable would be \"fearful\" to go on public transport if masks were not compulsory.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had not yet taken the decision whether to require masks on trams in Manchester as he wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion.\nIndustry body the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, says that travelling by train is \"low-risk\" and \"any decision to leave public transport behind other parts of the economy would need to be based on the science\".\nHowever, the Unite union has said previously that dropping mask-wearing on public transport would be \"gross negligence\". \nUnite's national officer for passenger transport, Bobby Morton, pointed to the number of deaths from Covid among bus drivers.\nHe has said that not only does mask wearing reduce transmissions, it helps provide reassurance to drivers and to passengers who are nervous about using public transport."

      "text": "Nearly a quarter of people who have died with Covid-19 in Wales were infected in hospital, figures have revealed.\nThere have been 1,860 patient deaths up to 1 May, 2021, where they \"definitely\" or \"probably\" caught it in hospital, test results showed.\nThe figures were revealed in a Freedom of Information request by Welsh language news programme Newyddion S4C.\nThe Welsh government said each case was being investigated.\n\"Definite\" cases are defined by health boards as those who tested positive more than 14 days after being admitted to hospital. \n\"Probable\" cases are when positive tests are collected between seven and 14 days after admission.\nIn two of the seven health board areas, figures for Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay showed one in three Covid deaths were due to hospital onset cases.\nData for all deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate was requested. Most health boards supplied that data but two - Hywel Dda and Betsi Cadwaladr - gave figures for deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nFigures for Powys health board have not been included, as it has no general hospitals and the most seriously ill patients were treated in England. \nDennis Keirle recovered from cancer but suffered stomach pains and went for treatment at Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf. He died in April 2020, aged 79, and his family believe he caught Covid there. \nHis granddaughter Carlee Keirle said: \"I don't know how hospitals have let this happen.\n\"I'd like to see a Wales-wide inquiry.\"\nShe said it would give families such as her's \"peace of mind\".\nFormer Labour MP Betty Williams also lost her husband Evan, to Covid, in April last year. \nWhen he was admitted to hospital with acute pneumonia, he was twice tested for Covid, with both returning negative results. But after his death, his wife discovered he had tested positive for the virus.\n\"If those two results were negative, he's been there a fortnight before dying and had a positive result - the result coming out just hours after he died,\" she said. \n\"I can't prove anything, that's difficult. It looks likely to me [he caught the virus in hospital] but I'll leave that to everyone else's imagination.\"\nShe has written to the health board's chief executive to complain about her husband's treatment, claiming that she was denied access to doctors to discuss his condition and that a \"do not resuscitate order\" was placed on Mr Williams without her knowledge.\n\"I last saw him in the ambulance going down the hill here but I feel the lack of answers from Betsi Cadwaladr are disgusting,\" she told Newyddion S4C.\n\"I'll never get Evan back, but I feel by asking questions about the way in which his case was dealt, it will hopefully help others.\"\nThe health board's chief executive Jo Whitehead said: \"We recognise Mrs Williams remains concerned about her husband's care and this is being further investigated by senior clinical staff.\"\nGP Dr Eilir Hughes has been one of the founders of the Fresh Air campaign, which has called for improved ventilation and adequate PPE to be used to combat Covid-19. \nHe said: \"It isn't surprising a high number of those who caught the virus at hospital subsequently died, as they represent some of the most vulnerable people in society, and we know the virus is more dangerous for them.\n\"However, the Welsh government now need to prioritise measures to prevent aerosol spread of Covid-19. Things such as ventilation, using UV-C light to sterilise air and asking patients to wear a mask if they can tolerate doing so.\"\nIn a statement, the Welsh government said: \"The NHS in Wales has worked incredibly hard throughout the pandemic to do all it can to keep the virus out of hospitals and to protect people being cared for, often in very difficult circumstances. \n\"Strict infection prevention and control guidance has been followed and we have issued extensive guidance on social distancing and hospital visiting. \n\"Testing has been in widespread use in the NHS; staff were among the first to be vaccinated and hundreds of millions of items of PPE have been used to help protect staff and patients. \n\"Despite all these measures, unfortunately infection has occurred in hospitals and very sadly people have died after contracting Covid in hospitals. Each case is being thoroughly investigated.\""

They also reported having more time to spend with their families, do hobbies and complete household chores. \nWill Stronge, director of research at Autonomy, said: \"This study shows that the world's largest ever trial of a shorter working week in the public sector was by all measures an overwhelming success.\n\"It shows that the public sector is ripe for being a pioneer of shorter working weeks - and lessons can be learned for other governments.\"\nGudmundur Haraldsson, a researcher at Alda, said: \"The Icelandic shorter working week journey tells us that not only is it possible to work less in modern times, but that progressive change is possible too.\"\nSpain is piloting a four day working week for companies in part due to the challenges of coronavirus.\nAnd consumer goods giant Unilever is giving staff in New Zealand a chance to cut their hours by 20% without hurting their pay in a trial.\nIn May, a report commissioned by the 4 Day Week campaign from Platform London suggested that shorter hours could cut the UK's carbon footprint."

How will lifting the travel ban affect you? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. \nGermany's vaccination campaign has made big advances: by Monday 32.4m people - or 39% of the total population - had been fully vaccinated against Covid, Germany's RP news website reported. Recipients of at least one jab totalled 56.5%.\nThe Germany-wide infection rate has declined to about five per 100,000 people over seven days - a much lower rate than in the UK. In none of the 16 German regions is the rate above 10.\nCurrently Germany has 526 Covid patients in intensive care, German ntv news reports - again far below Germany's peak levels in the pandemic.\nOn Monday, the RKI reported 440 new infections and 31 Covid-related deaths in Germany.\nGermany's relaxation of restrictions came a few hours after Mr Johnson confirmed the UK was expecting to lift all Covid-related rules from 19 July.\nThe UK government is also expected to announce plans for fully-vaccinated British people to travel to \"amber\" countries - that is, countries designated as medium risk for Covid, including many in Europe - without having to quarantine on their return.\nGerman travel agents say they have a high level of bookings for short summer holidays abroad, with no apparent trend towards cancellations because of Covid.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas has called for all Covid-related restrictions to be lifted once all adults in Germany have been offered vaccinations, \"which should happen during August\". \nAnd a YouGov survey quoted by DPA news agency said 51% of Germans questioned would support lifting all restrictions for those fully vaccinated from September.

      "text": "The US military left Bagram Airfield - its key base in Afghanistan - in the dead of night without notifying the Afghans, the base's new commander said.\nGeneral Asadullah Kohistani told the BBC that the US left Bagram at 03:00 local time on Friday, and that the Afghan military found out hours later. \nBagram also contains a prison, and there are reportedly up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners left in the facility.\nThe Taliban have been advancing rapidly in Afghanistan as US troops withdraw.\nGeneral Kohistani said on Monday that Afghan forces were expecting the Taliban to attack Bagram.\nSpeaking to reporters at the airbase, he said he was already receiving reports the group was making \"movements in rural areas\" nearby.\n\"You know, if we compare ourselves with the Americans, it's a big difference,\" Gen Kohistani said. \"But according to our capabilities... we are trying to do the best and as much as possible secure and serve all the people.\"\nThe US announced on Friday that it had vacated Bagram, effectively completing its military campaign in Afghanistan ahead of the official end date of 11 September, announced by President Joe Biden earlier this year.\nThe withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan is more than 90% completed, the Pentagon's Central Command said on Tuesday.\nThe Americans left behind about 3.5 million items, Gen Kohistani said, including tens of thousands of bottles of water, energy drinks and military ready-made meals, known as MREs. They also left behind thousands of civilian vehicles, without keys, and hundreds of armoured vehicles, the Associated Press reported.\nThey took heavy weapons with them and detonated some ammunition stocks, but left behind small weapons and ammunition for the Afghans, Gen Kohistani said. \nAsked by the Associated Press about the late-night withdrawal from the base, US military spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett referred to a statement issued last week that said US forces had co-ordinated their departure from various bases with Afghan leaders. \nWithin 20 minutes of the US's departure on Friday night the electricity was shut down and the base was plunged into darkness, the AP reported - a signal to looters who smashed through barriers and ransacked the abandoned buildings. Leftover items from the base have ended up in nearby scrap yards and second hand shops. \nAt its height, Bagram base was home to tens of thousands of troops. It ballooned from a basic Afghan air base to a mini-city with swimming pools, cinemas, spas and imported fast food outlets Burger King and Pizza Hut.\nThe airfield was built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, becoming its main base in the 1980s as it defended its occupation of Afghanistan.\nIt was later occupied by the Moscow-backed Afghan government and then a mujahideen administration, before eventually winding up in Taliban hands when the group swept to power in the mid 1990s.\nWhen the US invaded in 2001, it deposed the Taliban and took control of the airbase, transforming it into a sprawling complex from which it fought its war against the group.\nThe late-night withdrawal by the US hands control of the base to a much less well-equipped force that could struggle to defend it from the Taliban, which has made swift advances in recent weeks across the country, seizing rural districts and surrounding some larger cities. \nThe group claims to have taken more than 10 new districts in the past 24 hours. Despite the movements on the ground, stalled peace talks were renewed last week between representatives of the Taliban and Afghan government in Doha, the capital of Qatar.\nZabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC that they would present a plan to the team negotiating on behalf of the Afghan government and both sides would discuss it. \nGen Kohistani has roughly 3,000 troops under his command - significantly less than the tens of thousands of US and allied soldiers that once occupied Bagram airbase.\nAbout 1,000 Afghan soldiers fighting the Taliban in the north of the country fled over the border into Tajikistan on Monday, according to officials, raising fears over the military's ability to stave off further advances by the group.\nOn Tuesday, a diplomat said Germany had closed its consulate general in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. The last German troops left the country last week."

Across the whole of last year, 17 teenagers were killed in violent attacks in the capital.\nIf teenage deaths continue at the current rate, this will be the worst year for young homicides in London since 2008.\nThe 15-year-old boy was found with a stab injury on Woolwich New Road.\nPictures on social media showed members of the public holding up sheets to provide privacy as emergency crews tried to save the boy's life.\nHe was treated by paramedics but was pronounced dead at 18:10.\nThree knives were visible on the street following the attack.\nPolice arrested a 15-year-old boy on suspicion of murder after he arrived at a south London hospital with a stab wound.\nHis injury was not thought to be life-threatening, the Met said.\nSupt Petra Lazar said it was \"shocking and extremely saddening that a teenage boy has lost his life as the result of knife crime\".\nThe officer added that the attack would \"understandably cause worry and concern to local residents and I would like to reassure them my officers are supporting the murder detectives in every way we can\".\nThe 16-year-old boy who was killed in Oval Place, Vauxhall, was also pronounced dead at the scene.\nPolice and paramedics had been called to the area at 23:45. The families of both killed teenagers have been informed, Scotland Yard said.\n\"Unfortunately, as shocking as it is, it's not uncommon,\" said one resident of Elworth House near the site of the stabbing.\n\"You always have issues here. It's really bad,\" he said.\nThey warned it would happen. Now the prediction by the Met and City Hall, that violence would surge as lockdown eased, is being realised. \nLast week the mayor announced more money for diversion schemes and the Met promised a \"relentless focus\u2026 on suppressing violence\". \nIt's hard not to feel sceptical. We've heard it all before and the killings continue - teenage lives, ebbing away on pavements as people film the chaos on their phones. \nI've seen the Met's efforts to take weapons off the streets. I don't doubt officers' determination to stop the stabbings - after all, they are usually first on the scene, carrying the trauma of what they've seen way beyond the end of their shift.\nLast year a police wellbeing survey carried out by the College of Policing found that 64% of officers had symptoms of post-traumatic stress. \nBut what of the trauma experienced by London's teenagers? We've asked time after time how we can stem the violence. \nNow we must ask ourselves the same question once more because as those grieving in Vauxhall and Woolwich know all too well, what we are doing isn't working.\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said: \"I am heartbroken and appalled by the deaths of two teenagers in our city. \n\"Every loss of life leaves a family and a community devastated. My thoughts remain with the victims' family and friends at this extremely difficult time.\n\"I am determined to do everything in my power to support the police and our communities to put an end to these horrendous crimes and keep our young people safe.\""

      "text": "Vauxhall owner Stellantis has announced plans to build electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire.\nThe \u00a3100m investment, which the UK government will contribute to, will safeguard more than 1,000 factory jobs.\nThe future of the plant has been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company scrapped plans to build its new Astra model there.\nThe Ellesmere Port plant will also make electric passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn.\nProduction of an all-electric van will start in 2022, the carmaker said.\nThe government has held talks with Stellantis about options for the Cheshire factory and ministers are understood to have offered about \u00a330m in financial support.\nCarlos Tavares, head of Stellantis, had previously warned that the company would no longer invest in pure diesel or petrol cars at the plant, and said a decision on where it would build electric vehicles would depend on the UK government's support of the car sector.\nMr Tavares said: \"Performance is always the trigger for sustainability and this \u00a3100m investment demonstrates our commitment to the UK and to Ellesmere Port.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port, and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships.\" \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \"Ellesmere Port's proud tradition in auto manufacturing will continue for many years to come thanks to today's investment.\"\nHe said that the investment will also \"secure thousands of jobs across the region in the supply chain\".\n\"In this global race to secure electric vehicle production, we are proud to support Britain's auto sector in this crucial transition as we work to build back better,\" Mr Kwarteng added.\nSales of vans have been booming during the pandemic, as a result of growing home delivery sales.\nVauxhall's Luton plant is currently operating at full capacity so Stellantis wants to expand production at Ellesmere Port to serve the UK market.\nLike other manufacturers it is also preparing for an all-electric future. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with other European countries setting similar targets.\nLast week, Japanese carmaker Nissan announced an expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs.\nHollie Hughes, 24, an engineer at the Ellesmere Port plant, who started as an apprentice nearly eight years ago, said the plans were \"so exciting\", especially the electric vehicle aspect.\n\"It's a massive highlight for Ellesmere Port,\" she said, adding that her team will be \"heavily involved\" in implementing the plans.\nOliver Holden, 27, a manufacturing engineer at the plant, said the employees had waited a long time for the announcement.\n\"From today, everyone will be pleased - the mood will be lifted, I believe,\" he said. \"Everyone now can focus on the next challenges and move towards the future.\"\nProfessor David Bailey, an economist at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme that Vauxhall's plans would support jobs in the short term, but there was a question over how sustainable they would make Ellesmere Port. \n\"There is there is no [Stellantis electric vehicle] battery plant being built in the UK... so if batteries are being brought in from France and elsewhere, that's going to add to costs and it's going leave Ellesmere Port as a relatively high-cost location,\" he said. \n\"[Building one in the UK] would really anchor vehicle production at Stellantis at Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK.\n\"Longer term we're going to need a lot of batteries in the UK and we will need battery plants to keep mass car and vehicle production here.\" \nStellantis is currently building two battery plants, one in France and one in Germany, and is looking to establish a third, rumoured to be in Italy.\nThe two \"gigafactories\" at Douvrin in France and Kaiserslautern in Germany will get French and German government support of \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a31.1bn).\nThe Ellesmere Port plant will have a new body shop and investment in general assembly and on site battery pack assembly. Work will begin on potential wind and solar farms at the site.\nStellantis will also consult on the creation of a UK parts distribution centre which will require further investment.\nThe outlook for the British automotive industry is certainly a lot rosier now than it was just a few months ago.  \nWithout investment in new products every few years, car plants die; and the ageing factory at Ellesmere Port has long been regarded as particularly vulnerable.  \nEarlier this year Carlos Tavares, the acerbic chief executive of Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis, made it very clear that investment would only arrive if the government itself were prepared to support the industry.\nIt appears the government has done just that, with both Nissan and Stellantis, pledging to spend serious amounts of money developing electric vehicles here as a result.\nBut there's a long way to go to secure the future of car manufacturing, as it prepares for an all-electric future. After years of uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit, which made carmakers reluctant to commit to new plans, the UK is still playing catch-up.\nSo while the news from Nissan and Vauxhall has been widely welcomed, people within the sector agree that much more is needed.\nStellantis is the world's fifth-largest carmaker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler.\nEllesmere Port, acquired by Vauxhall Motors in 1957 from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, initially developed the site as a sub-assembly and engine production line for its Dunstable and Luton factories.\nIt produced its first car, the Vauxhall Viva, in 1964, and produced the Viva, Chevette, and Vauxhall and Opel Astra.\nEmployment peaked at the site in 1975, with 12,000 people on staff."

They also reported having more time to spend with their families, do hobbies and complete household chores. \nWill Stronge, director of research at Autonomy, said: \"This study shows that the world's largest ever trial of a shorter working week in the public sector was by all measures an overwhelming success.\n\"It shows that the public sector is ripe for being a pioneer of shorter working weeks - and lessons can be learned for other governments.\"\nGudmundur Haraldsson, a researcher at Alda, said: \"The Icelandic shorter working week journey tells us that not only is it possible to work less in modern times, but that progressive change is possible too.\"\nSpain is piloting a four day working week for companies in part due to the challenges of coronavirus.\nAnd consumer goods giant Unilever is giving staff in New Zealand a chance to cut their hours by 20% without hurting their pay in a trial.\nIn May, a report commissioned by the 4 Day Week campaign from Platform London suggested that shorter hours could cut the UK's carbon footprint."

Sainsbury's says 18% of its sales are online, compared with 8% in 2019-20.\nSainsbury's - the UK's second largest supermarket chain - also said online sales jumped 29% in the first quarter of its financial year compared with last year, and were 142% higher than before coronavirus struck. \nHowever, it added: \"As restrictions continue to ease, customers are beginning to return to more normal shopping patterns, with online demand reducing gradually from peak levels and transaction numbers increasing in stores.\" \nTrading overall at Sainsbury's was stronger than expected in the 16 weeks to 26 June. with sales up by 1.6% from a year earlier.\nThe retailer said there were a number of areas of concern, however, including potential price pressures from rising commodity prices and freight costs. \nMr Roberts also said the business was facing challenges from a shortage of HGV drivers and there had been an increase in staff absence because of Covid. \nHe said he would consult staff on their views on face masks, but said the decision to wear one would be down to individual choice.\n\"There are two very distinct points of view.

      "text": "A Church of Ireland minister has resigned his post claiming that the church is \"structurally, culturally and socially homophobic\".\nThe Reverend Andrew Rawding is rector of Brackaville, Donaghendry and Ballyclog in County Tyrone.\nHe announced his resignation in his three parish churches on Sunday morning.\nThe Church of Ireland declined to comment on Mr Rawding's resignation and comments when contacted by BBC News NI. \nMr Rawding said that his parishioners were in shock and some were in tears when he said he was resigning.\nHe told BBC News NI that many had \"expressed sadness\" that he was leaving his role.\nHe has been a Church of Ireland minister for a decade and has previously helped run Pride parades in the mid Ulster area.\nMr Rawding claimed that the Church of Ireland was \"structurally, culturally and socially homophobic\".\n\"There are some kind and compassionate individuals but corporately, at best there is indifference, at worst there is hypocrisy,\" he said.\nHe also claimed that there was \"an aggressive and proactive opposition to full inclusion and equality for LGBT+ people, with some people still weaponising Bible verses and using the language of condemnation and rejection\".\n\"I have made a public stance in the past as a Church of Ireland rector to send a message to the LGBT+ community that it's OK to be LGBT+ and to be a Christian and to show my full support for same-sex marriages within the Church of Ireland,\" he said.\n\"Currently the stance is homophobic and discriminatory.\"\nMr Rawding said he was \"originally motivated\" to make this stance within his parishes. \n\"Although sadly there are still grandparents and relatives who will not accept LGBT children within their own families,\" he added. \nThe Church of Ireland has established a select committee on sexuality to enable \"the listening, dialogue and learning process on all aspects concerning human sexuality in the context of Christian belief to continue\".\nThat committee reported in 2016 and found that how a gay Christian in the Church of Ireland felt they were treated often depended on \"the stance of the rector\".\nThe Church of Ireland synod had previously said that \"members of the Church have at times hurt and wounded people by words and actions, in relation to human sexuality\".\nBut Mr Rawding said that, in his view, the \"listening process\" carried out by the church had been a \"tick-box exercise\".\n\"At no point has anyone in a position of authority within the Church of Ireland been in touch with me or during a conversation with me said: 'Thanks for making a compassionate stand Andrew, let's see how we can progress this',\" he said.\n\"All I have had is blank looks and silence, or comments like: 'I'm not homophobic because I know gay people', or even: 'You need to be careful because people will think you're gay.'\nDissatisfaction with Church's stance had been building\nMr Rawding's resignation came as a surprise, according to his parishioners. Many were in shock and in tears when he announced it.\nHe is someone who has spoken out quite openly in the past for his support for LGBT rights and his disappointment in the church's negative attitude to LGBT people as he saw it.\nHe was one of those behind the first Mid Ulster pride parade, carrying a banner apologising for the church's attitude to LGBT people, so he has been someone who made his views known on the issue for quite a while.\nWhen he had spoken out in the past in support of LGBT rights, he'd had very little or no support from senior church figures.\nLike all Christian denominations, the Church of Ireland has been wrestling with LGBT issues and how to treat members who are LGBT.\nIt does seem like dissatisfaction with the Church of Ireland's stance on LGBT rights has been building up with Mr Rawding for some time.\n\"In my experience, the listening process to LGBT+ people has been a tick-box exercise, being seen to be doing the right thing but not exercising courageous and compassionate leadership.\"\nMr Rawding said there was a very serious issue of self harm and \"suicidal ideation\" within the LGBT community. \n\"Particularly when people in the Church of Ireland and other churches continue to proactively discriminate against LGBT+ people and use the language of 'sin' in relation to not just someone's identity but their very being,\" he added. \nMr Rawding said that he now plans to start a degree in social work.\nHe said that was to \"follow a call to help encourage and empower those people that Jesus called \"the least of these\", that is those adults and children who through no fault of their own have been let down by society and the churches,\" he said.\nIn June, a Presbyterian minister in County Antrim - the Reverend Ian Carton - stood down over that church's decision to deny same-sex couples full membership."

There were 10 deaths below the five-year average in the latest week. \nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the pandemic. \nThe number of deaths from all causes in Wales fell to 563 in the week ending 25 June, with 0.2% mentioning Covid on the death certificate. \nDeaths were above average in both Scotland and Northern Ireland in the same week.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 48,277 deaths from all causes in Wales, with 7,900 (16.4%) mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 4,896 deaths above the five-year average. \nIn about 83% of Covid deaths last year, it was the underlying cause and no other pre-existing conditions were mentioned on the death certificate. \nThe second wave brought a peak in early January, but the third wave so far has brought very low numbers of deaths.\nPublic Health Wales on Tuesday reported a death in Cwm Taf Morgannwg on Saturday, taking the total in the last week to three.\nThese deaths will be included in future ONS figures, once registered.\nThere has still not been a jump in Covid hospital admissions, which remain close to last week's lows.\nWe can see how case rises in the third wave have still not translated into hospital numbers.\nHowever, the daily figure for people with confirmed Covid tests in hospital beds on Monday had risen to 56 - the highest since April.\nNumbers of people with Covid in critical care were also up to eight.\nAt the moment, the daily average of combined confirmed, suspected and recovering Covid patients in hospital remains close to its lowest point.\nThe Wales case rate has reached 103.2 cases per 100,000 - the first time it has been in three figures since early February. But with the easing of restrictions across the UK, cases are rising everywhere and the rate in Wales is still less than all other UK nations and English regions.\nWrexham - which has its highest incidence cluster in Rhos and Johnstown - has the highest in Wales but is the 127th highest in the UK. Ceredigion is the lowest in the mainland UK, among five Welsh local authorities in the lowest 20 in the UK.\nYoung people under 30 still make up 60% of all positive tests, with a shift in the age profile in recent weeks thanks to the vaccination programme.\nUnited Arab Emirates (74%) has now overtaken Wales (71.9%) as top ranking sizeable country for giving first doses. Wales is sixth in the world for second doses.\nThere were 114,365 doses given out in the past seven days - 90% were second doses. This is about 10,000 doses down on the week before.\nThe proportion of the population vaccinated stands at nearly 72%, while 55.4% of people have had second doses.\nSeparate figures out from Care Inspectorate Wales show, in the past two weeks, there have been two reported deaths of care home residents relating to suspected or confirmed Covid, having had no notifications between 26 March and 22 June.\nIt said there were 20 care homes which have reported cases involving staff or residents in the past week, an increase since the start of June, although numbers are still relatively low."

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "For more than a year, personal freedoms have been curtailed to keep Covid at bay. \nThat looks likely to change, with ministers proposing to lift many of the remaining restrictions in England on 19 July. The details, set out on Monday, have sparked intense debate. \nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling led to the first lockdown, has said it is a gamble, but one worth taking.\nWhat is unarguable is that the nature of the pandemic in the UK has changed - and with it so should many of our assumptions. \nThe rollout of the vaccination programme has altered everything, reducing both the individual risk and the wider one to the health system.\nBack in January, about one in 10 infections could be expected to translate into a hospital admission 10 days later. Now that figure appears to be somewhere between one in 40 and one in 50.\nWhat is more, those ending up in hospital seem to be less sick, and need less intensive treatment.\nThe risk of death, as a result, has reduced even further. In January about one in 60 cases resulted in someone dying. Today it's fewer than one in 1,000.\nBut this does not mean England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is not heading for a significant third wave.\nAs the charts above show, infection rates are rising. If they rise enough, that has the potential to cause a significant number of hospitalisations, possibly 1,000 a day before summer is out. \nMany may wonder how this can happen given how effective the vaccines are. \nIndividually, those who have had two doses are at a very tiny risk of getting seriously ill, but with infection rates high it means many people are taking that tiny risk at the same time. Add to that those who are unvaccinated or for whom the vaccines do not work as well and you can get a lot of admissions to hospital.\nBut serious illness happens all the time. In the depths of winter there can be 1,000 admissions a day for respiratory infections. \nFlu alone killed more than 20,000 people in England in the winter of 2017-18. There was no talk of the need to introduce restrictions or curtail freedoms then. \n\"That is the context we need to start seeing Covid in,\" says Prof Robert Dingwall, a sociologist at Nottingham Trent University.\nBut why even take the risk? Why not - as scientists on Independent Sage have suggested -wait until the adult vaccination rollout is complete in September?\nThere was always going to be an \"exit wave\" once restrictions were lifted. And government scientists are hopeful the wall of immunity built up by natural infection and the vaccine rollout so far will soon kick in and flatten the wave. \nThe fact remains interventions are not harm-free, so in the end it comes down to difficult judgements about trade-offs. \nAs the virus presents less of a risk, that in turn shifts the balance on what can be considered proportionate.\nPerhaps the clearest example of this is what is happening with schools where there are currently more than 500,000 children at home self-isolating in England because they were deemed to have close contact with an infected person at school. \nThat's 20 children out of school for every positive case.\nThis approach started in September, before vaccines had even completed their clinical trials. The idea was to contain spread of the virus to protect vulnerable adults - children are at incredibly low risk from Covid.\nNow that all over-50s have had the chance of a second jab - these are the age groups where 99% of Covid deaths have occurred - the benefits of quarantining children like this is hugely reduced, while the costs in terms of disruption to education are clear to see.\nMinisters say they will change this approach in time for September, but should this have been avoided given how much school has been disrupted already?\nThere are other arguments for why it should be now.\n\"Covid will never go away,\" says Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia. \"It's inevitable that we're going to catch it repeatedly for the rest of our lives, whether we have had the vaccine or not. \n\"The issues becomes not whether it is safe to lift all restrictions, but when would it be safest to do so.\"\nWaiting any longer could make the situation worse, he believes, extending the exit wave into the autumn when schools are back and the flu season is getting under way.\nIt was a view echoed by England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said it had his personal backing when the government unveiled its plans on Monday.\nBut the idea of letting a virus spread when we have spent so long trying to do the opposite requires a psychological shift.\nDr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at University of St Andrews, says this will take time.\n\"We need to accept Covid is here. We won't be able to completely stop the spread. We are now at the stage of managing the virus.\"\nShe would like to see more emphasis now on recovery, tackling the backlog in hospital care for non-Covid treatments, dealing with the economic fallout and loss of jobs and the emotional and mental health toll the pandemic has had.\nBut none of this is without risks. What if infection rates keep rising and that wall of immunity is slow to kick in?\nUnderstandable concerns have also been raised about those who are at risk because they have conditions such as blood cancer which mean the vaccines do not work as well or who have a higher chance of exposure because of their jobs, such as shop or factory workers. \nThere is also Long Covid to contend with - although the risks of this are far from fully understood.\nWe are, perhaps, the first country to find ourselves in this situation, where we are attempting to return to normal in the face of a rapidly rising rate of infection and a more infectious variant, Delta.\nOthers will soon face similar dilemmas. It's why the world will be watching what happens on these shores."

I found it unbelievable.\"\nMs Banks' allegations have again highlighted the treatment of women in Mr Morrison's conservative government and wider Australian politics. \nSeparate allegations of rape - in Parliament House and against a senior government minister - prompted a wave of #MeToo protests across the country earlier this year.\nMs Banks has previously spoken out about sexism and misogyny in Australian politics. \nThe former MP sensationally quit the Liberal party in 2018, after then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was deposed in a leadership coup which installed Scott Morrison.\nIn her exit speech at the time, she condemned the \"bullying and intimidation\" she had experienced in parliament. Ms Banks, a former lawyer, said parliament was decades behind the corporate world in its attitudes towards women.\nShe has expanded on this \"anti-women\" culture in her book, Power Play: Breaking Through Bias, Barriers and Boys' Clubs.\nIn it, she also alleges that Mr Morrison tried to \"bully\" her after she announced her departure and tried to silence her. He was like \"constant, menacing, background wallpaper\", she said.\nA spokesperson for the prime minister acknowledged Mr Morrison held several conversations with Ms Banks. \n\"The prime minister was disappointed in Ms Banks' decision to quit the parliamentary party and had several conversations with her to understand what she was going through to see what support could be offered before she made her decision,\" the spokesperson said.\nThey added that Mr Morrison \"absolutely rejects claims about the nature of those conversations\". \nAustralia's parliament is currently subject to a workplace culture inquiry being run by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner.\nThe inquiry was one of five started after a former government aide, Brittany Higgins, spoke out about her alleged rape by a senior colleague in a ministerial office in 2019."

      "text": "New York has become the first US state to declare a disaster emergency order to address rising gun violence.\nNew York state saw 51 shootings over the 4 July holiday weekend, Governor Andrew Cuomo said as he signed the executive order.\nThe directive will funnel $138.7m (\u00a3100m) towards gun violence intervention and prevention programmes. \nIt comes amid reports of a rise in gun deaths countrywide, including nearly 200 over the past weekend.\nIn March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. In the US, the majority of homicides are gun-related. \nUS President Joe Biden unveiled a White House strategy to combat the rise in homicides in late June, which includes curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. It also delegates more funding for personnel - including law enforcement.\nGovernor Cuomo's state disaster declaration describes gun violence as a public health crisis, and made several comparisons to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health response. \n\"If you look at the recent numbers, more people are now dying from gun violence and crime than Covid,\" the Democratic governor said. \n\"Just like we did with Covid, New York is going to lead the nation once again with a comprehensive approach to combating and preventing gun violence.\"\nMr Cuomo's emergency declaration releases emergency funds that he will direct towards: \nAs New York emerged as the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak last year, Mr Cuomo was widely hailed by US media for his handling of the pandemic.\nHe has since faced accusations of a cover-up since it emerged his office undercounted Covid-19 deaths among its nursing home residents by thousands, after his administration issued a directive in March 2020 ordering those facilities to take in coronavirus patients.\nScrutiny of the governor was compounded by multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, including those of current and former state employees - which he denies.\nA recent poll by Siena College found that just one-third of voters in the majority Democratic state want Mr Cuomo to run for re-election. Nearly a quarter of those polled said he should resign immediately. "

      "text": "Changes to local taxes, government house purchase schemes and planning laws could be introduced to tackle a second homes \"crisis\" in Wales.\nThe Welsh government will pick an area of Wales to pilot new policies in an attempt to \"inject fairness back into the housing system\".\nOfficials will also look at options to shut a tax \"loophole\" where some second home owners do not pay council tax.\nBut the plans were accused of being \"weak\" and \"vague\" by Plaid Cymru.\nThe Welsh Conservatives also questioned whether second homes were making areas unaffordable.\nThere were 24,873 second homes registered for council tax purposes in January 2021, according to official figures. \nOfficials say numbers of homes could be much higher depending on the exact definition of a second home.\nGwynedd has the highest number of second homes at 5,098, which represents 20% of all second homes in Wales.\nThere are 4,068 in Pembrokeshire, while Cardiff has 3,477, Anglesey 2,139 and 2,104 in Swansea.\nRachel Kelway-Lewis, 25, is among those finding it difficult to get on the housing ladder in Wales.\nOriginally from the village of Solva in Pembrokeshire, she is now living in a caravan she rents just outside St Davids. \n\"It's incredibly difficult\" to get on the housing ladder in the area, the Carmarthenshire council worker said.\n\"Currently there's plots being sold for \u00a3350,000 alone... luxury developments, when so many local people can't afford to live in the area they've grown up in.\n\"I moved away for university and then I've come back to the area.\n\"I'd really like to buy locally and I work full-time, but unfortunately we're being priced out by second homeowners.\"\nCampaigners and politicians in west and north Wales have been calling on the government to act to tackle what they believe is a second homes crisis.\nIn response to a report on the issue by Dr Simon Brooks, of Swansea University, the Welsh government is promising \"a summer of action which will determine how we tackle this issue now and into the future\".\nJulie James, the climate change minister responsible for housing, said Wales was the only part of the UK to give councils the power to introduce a 100% council tax premium on second homes, but added \"the urgency and gravity of this situation calls for further intervention\".\nThe minister is proposing three solutions:\nPolicy measures will be trialled and evaluated in a pilot area, which will be decided over the summer, before being considered for wider rollout.\nA Welsh Language Community Housing Plan, to protect the particular interests of Welsh language communities, will be published for consultation in the autumn.\n\"The continuing rise of house prices mean people, especially younger generations, can no longer afford to live in the communities they have grown up in,\" Ms James said. \n\"A high concentration of second homes or holiday lets can have a very detrimental impact on small communities, and in some areas could compromise the Welsh language being spoken at a community level.\"\nBut Welsh Conservative climate change spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders argued that while rising house prices mean people can no longer to afford to live in their home communities, \"the minister has made a grave error by linking this to second homes\". \"The report by Dr Simon Brooks made important points, including that there is little evidence that second homes are the main cause of high house prices as opposed to buyers moving to reside there permanently.\"\nShe called for Ms James \"to restore the Right-to-Buy in those crisis communities in Wales, reinvesting sale proceeds into more social housing and protecting homes from sale for 10 years\".\nMabon ap Gwynfor, housing spokesman for Plaid, said: \"These weak measures will not be nearly enough to truly get to grips with a housing emergency that is fast engulfing our communities at an alarming rate.\n\"There is nothing here about closing the council tax loophole. There is nothing here about imposing caps on second homes. And there is nothing here about bringing numbers of holiday homes into community ownership through public intervention.\n\"In fact, there is no detail just vague plans for more consultation,\" he added.\nResearch by Gwynedd council suggests that over 60% of people in the area are priced out of their local communities, with second homes making up 11% of the county's housing stock.\nCouncil leader Dyfrig Siencyn, a Plaid councillor, said: \"Consultations and pilot schemes will not assist young people keen to get onto the housing ladder this year, it is therefore exasperating to see that no direct immediate action will be made to support people now.\""

How will lifting the travel ban affect you? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. \nGermany's vaccination campaign has made big advances: by Monday 32.4m people - or 39% of the total population - had been fully vaccinated against Covid, Germany's RP news website reported. Recipients of at least one jab totalled 56.5%.\nThe Germany-wide infection rate has declined to about five per 100,000 people over seven days - a much lower rate than in the UK. In none of the 16 German regions is the rate above 10.\nCurrently Germany has 526 Covid patients in intensive care, German ntv news reports - again far below Germany's peak levels in the pandemic.\nOn Monday, the RKI reported 440 new infections and 31 Covid-related deaths in Germany.\nGermany's relaxation of restrictions came a few hours after Mr Johnson confirmed the UK was expecting to lift all Covid-related rules from 19 July.\nThe UK government is also expected to announce plans for fully-vaccinated British people to travel to \"amber\" countries - that is, countries designated as medium risk for Covid, including many in Europe - without having to quarantine on their return.\nGerman travel agents say they have a high level of bookings for short summer holidays abroad, with no apparent trend towards cancellations because of Covid.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas has called for all Covid-related restrictions to be lifted once all adults in Germany have been offered vaccinations, \"which should happen during August\". \nAnd a YouGov survey quoted by DPA news agency said 51% of Germans questioned would support lifting all restrictions for those fully vaccinated from September.

      "text": "A residential centre for women will be created in Wales, as an alternative to custody for those convicted of low-level crimes. \nIt will be the first of its kind in Wales or England and will focus on rehabilitation.\nThe announcement was made along with \u00a32.5m being made available to community services supporting women at risk of being drawn into crime. \nIt will be awarded later this year and cover costs such as wages and rent.\nThe investment is part of the the UK government's female offender strategy which looks to tackle the root causes of offending and divert women away from criminality and prison.\n\"Residential women centres will offer a robust alternative to short prison sentences and directly tackle the issues which often underlie offending, like substance misuse and mental health problems,\" said Justice Minister Lucy Frazer.\nIt will enable Welsh women to stay closer to home and maintain close ties with children and wider family - something the UK government believes is key in reducing offending.\n\"Having the first residential women's centre in Wales will mean more women being supported through rehabilitation closer to home, helping them adjust back to life in their communities,\" said Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart.\nThe Welsh Government also welcomed the move, with chief whip Jane Hutt saying: \"Welsh women need a safe and secure facility that is fit for purpose, while allowing them to maintain contact with their families, particularly children. The current Covid-19 outbreak has highlighted this even further.\"\nThe two governments will now work together to identify a provider and site, with the aim of opening the centre by the end of 2021.\nFunding of \u00a32.5m will also be given to groups involved in tackling issues such as domestic abuse, drug and alcohol rehabilitation.\nMany within the criminal justice system in Wales have been waiting for this news for years.\nOn average, there are fewer than 300 Welsh women in prison, but those numbers have been going up.\nOver the last decade, more than three quarters of them were given a sentence of less than a year - in fact, a quarter of them were sent to prison for a month or less.\nWhich means they'll typically have committed non-violent crimes like theft.\nGiven over half the women in prison have suffered domestic violence and many will have mental health or substance misuse problems, it's widely acknowledged that if you tackle and support those issues, you've a better chance of rehabilitating and reducing reoffending.\nAs well as the personal cost, there's also a huge cost implication to the state as women's prison places cost \u00a315,000 more per prisoner than a similar place for a man.\nThe challenge now will be deciding where to locate the new facility - it's been argued in the past that one would be needed in both north and south Wales.\nWith a budget of \u00a3800,000, the facility will have 12 beds but will also act as a community resource to support many more women caught up in the criminal justice system, whether they've been given a custodial sentence or not."

Amazon has since been arguing that Mr Trump exercised undue influence in the procurement process. \nThe Pentagon faced extended legal challenges by Amazon, and it seems likely that, too, was a factor in this decision. \nAn Amazon Web Services spokesperson told the BBC: \"We understand and agree with the DoD's decision. \n\"Unfortunately, the contract award was not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement.\"\nThey added that they \"look forward\" to supporting the department's modernisation efforts.\nMicrosoft said in a statement on Tuesday: \"It's clear the DoD trusts Microsoft and our technology, and we're confident that we'll continue to be successful as the DoD selects partners for new work.\""

      "text": "There is \"more uncertainty\" now than at any point since the start of the Covid pandemic, according to a top government health scientist.\nDr Rob Orford described the situation as a race between the growth of the Delta variant and the vaccines - which will determine how soon we can \"live with Covid\".\nThe case rate in Wales is currently 96 per 100,000 people.\nDr Orford said the vaccine uptake would make a big difference going forward.\nThe Welsh government's chief scientific advisor for health, explained how variants have come to develop: \"The virus needs people to make more copies of itself and replicates its 30,000-letter code. \n\"It's ruthless and every time it makes a new copy there's a chance a mistake can arise.\n\"If I write out the alphabet 1,000 times, there's a good chance I might make some random errors that might lead to new words - some of those might stick.\n\"If I ask you then to copy those letters, you could make your own mistakes.\n\"Some of those mistakes lead to mutations that will benefit the virus, it might make it able to stick to a cell easier, it might be able to gain access easier so it's through this rapid evolution we see different mutations - some will be good for the virus, some not so good.\"\nDr Orford said Wales was in a period with \"a great deal of uncertainty - probably more uncertainty than at any other point in the pandemic\".\n\"It's a foot race between the amount of vaccines we can put in people's arms and the growth of the variant in the community - but people have a great deal of control.\n\"We don't know how fast the Delta variant can run - whether it can run 40% faster than the Alpha variant - the old Kent strain - or 80% faster... But the crowd, the public, we can slow down Delta by taking sensible measures - keeping windows open, washing hands, if feeling unwell - not going out.\n\"We can stop Delta running away with the race.\"\nDr Orford said the new variant could result in significant pressure on the NHS, but added it could be avoided if vaccination proved to have sufficiently \"stretched the elastic\" linking infection and serious illness. \nDr Orford said young people needed to \"grab the opportunity\" of getting jabbed to protect themselves and others, despite the lower risk of being seriously ill.\nHe said the fewer who got the jab, the greater the risk of \"sparks landing on dry kindling\" and outbreaks taking hold.\n\"Whilst there are a fixed number of people that can go through the doors of a vaccination centre, the virus will exploit everybody that it comes into contact with and unless you've been vaccinated there's a risk that you'll get infected and go on to infect others and the numbers will rise very quickly.\"\nHe added that young people's behaviours could make a difference to how quickly restrictions could be relaxed and the prospects for what life will be like later on this year rested \"in all of our hands\".\nLooking to the future, Dr Orford is hopeful \"this storm will pass\", but as it's unlikely that Covid will be eliminated, society must learn to live with the virus some time.\n\"There's enormous amount of uncertainty and an significant amount of frustration, however, the way in which Wales and the people of Wales have reacted to Covid has been really quite incredible - but we're still going to need protective measures.\n\"A week is a long time in science so it's difficult to foresee what the next six months will look like but I would hope in a good version of reality the vaccines prove really effective.\"\nHe said we may still cases and levels of hospitalisations increase, but hopefully it will be less older and more vulnerable people as they are fully vaccinated.\n\"It's still in the gift of the public - how people mix, what do they do when they become unwell, to determine how cases will rise. I hope that vaccine progress will enable to have a more positive outcome.\"\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils.

      "text": "Three men jailed for allegedly attempting to rob a corrupt police officer nearly 50 years ago have had their convictions overturned.\nCourtney Harriot, Paul Green and Cleveland Davidson were arrested after leaving Stockwell station in 1972.\nThe trio, part of the so-called \"Stockwell Six\", were jailed largely on evidence from British Transport Police (BTP) officer Derek Ridgewell.\n\"It's vindication... It was a total stitch-up\" Mr Davidson said.\nThe men, all aged between 17 and 20 at the time, were accused of trying to rob Ridgewell, who was in plain clothes and had previously served in the South Rhodesian, now Zimbabwean, police force.\nThey were travelling on the London Underground from Stockwell station in south London, when Ridgewell claimed they attempted to rob him, before he fought back and arrested them with a team of undercover officers.\nAlthough each of the six pleaded not guilty, five were convicted and sent to jail or borstal, a youth detention centre, despite telling jurors that police officers had lied and subjected them to violence and threats.\nThe sixth member, Everet Mullins, was acquitted.\nThe two remaining members of the Stockwell Six who were convicted, Texo Joseph Johnson and Ronald De'Souza, have not yet been traced.\nSpeaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Davidson revealed it had \"ruined\" his life. \nHe said: \"It's vindication that we were innocent at the time. We were only young then, we did nothing.\"\nMr Davidson said Ridgewell was a \"corrupt and wicked and evil police officer\", adding: \"We don't know how many other people Ridgewell stitched up... it's just endless.\"\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which referred the convictions to the Court of Appeal, said it was \"desperate to find other men who were part of this group of friends so many years ago\".\nAt a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal cleared Mr Harriot, Mr Green and Mr Davidson, nearly five decades after they were convicted.\nQuashing the convictions and allowing the appeal, Sir Julian Flaux, sitting with Mr Justice Linden and Mr Justice Wall, said: \"It is most unfortunate that it has taken nearly 50 years to rectify the injustice suffered by these appellants.\"\nThe Stockwell Six case is the third time Ridgewell's corruption has led to wrongful convictions being overturned by the Court of Appeal.\nRidgewell was involved in a number of high-profile and controversial cases in the early 1970s, culminating in the 1973 acquittals of the \"Tottenham Court Road Two\" - two young Jesuits studying at Oxford University.\nHe was then moved into a department investigating mailbag theft, where he joined up with two criminals with whom he split the profits of stolen mailbags.\nRidgewell was eventually caught and jailed for seven years, dying of a heart attack in prison in 1982 at the age of 37.\nIn December 2019, three members of the \"Oval Four\" - who were arrested at Oval Underground station in 1972 and accused of stealing handbags by Ridgewell's \"mugging squad\" - also had their convictions overturned. The final member was cleared in March 2020 prompting calls for a \"wholesale review\" of all cases linked to Ridgewell.\nBTP Deputy Chief Constable Adrian Hanstock said: \"It is wholly regrettable that the criminal actions of a discredited former officer of this force over four decades ago led to these unsound prosecutions.\n\"I apologise unreservedly for the distress, anxiety and impact this will have undoubtedly caused those who were wrongly convicted.\"\nMr Hanstock added that, having \"examined all available records\" of investigations where Ridgewell was the principal officer, the force \"have not identified any additional matters that we feel should be referred for external review\".

      "text": "The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. \nIts approach reflects that of many firms which do not plan to ask staff to return full time to the office after current government guidance changes.\nCurrently people who can work from home are being asked to continue to do so, but this is set to end on 19 July.\nMany office workers have worked predominantly from home since the first lockdown in March last year. \nFrom 19 July, it is expected to be up to employers to determine whether their staff should be in the office.\nSince the pandemic, 5% of the Bank of England's 4,000 staff have been coming into the office.\nIts chief operating officer and deputy governor, Joanna Place, said a recent survey of Bank staff showed that the majority hope to continue to work from home for at least two days a week.\n\"In this spirit, the governors and I have established a set of trial guidelines - and which we are positioning as a pilot - which encourage more flexible working and only ask that our colleagues return to the office at least once per week for 'team days'.\"\nThe Bank said it would not instigate this system until September. \nMs Place said time and physical presence with teams was important and she expected that staff would eventually average about three-four days in the office, with one to two days working from home. \nMajor commercial banks are adopting different working approaches. Goldman Sachs has told staff to be ready to return to the workplace in July, whereas NatWest's new working model could see just 13% of staff in the office full-time.\nThe Centre for Cities think tank said the number of people back in their place of work across the UK's largest towns and cities was still just a quarter of what it was pre-pandemic.\nPaul Swinney from Centre for Cities said the lack of people working in offices had been a \"real challenge\" for shops, cafes and pubs who used to depend on office workers for business. \n\"The change to the 'back to the office' advice will doubtless be good news for them, but a question mark remains over how many workers will return now restrictions have lifted,\" he said.\nAdvertising business Havas Creative used to have 1,800 staff in its central London office.\nChief executive, Chris Hirst, told the BBC he had changed his view about home and office working: \"Last April I would have said we need to get everyone back into the office as quickly as we can. I don't think that's the case any more.\n\"I do think that we will move to a hybrid working model and that could and should be to the benefit of both employers and employees.\n\"I hope we will get to a place in September where we have all of the people [in the office] some of the time.\"\nDavid Abrahamovitch, founder of Grind coffee shops, said the relaxation on office-working rules was \"very much welcomed\".\nHe previously said the four-week delay to restrictions ending \"killed the summer\" for his London-based coffee shops, which rely on commuters for business. \n\"We are looking forward to seeing more people back in the city,\" he said. \"I hope lots of companies will follow the lead of those such as Apple and mandate a return to the office for at least three days per week.\"\nAlmost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers previously told the BBC they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time.\nSome 43 of the firms said they would embrace so-called hybrid working, a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week.\nPeter Cheese, chief executive of the CIPD, said a return to the office should be \"down to individual organisations consulting with their people to agree working arrangements\".\n\"'Freedom Day' shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces, but it could signal the start of greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work,\" he added.\n\"Businesses shouldn't rush to simply revert to how they used to work, now we have experience and evidence that it can be done differently,\" he said.\nAlistair Elliott, a senior partner at Knight Frank, said the estate agent \"wholeheartedly\" welcomed the lifting of working from home guidance.\n\"While this was imperative at the beginning of the pandemic, we look forward to seeing our great towns and cities fill up again, bringing all the benefits that the best collaborative workplaces create,\" he added.\nRichard Burge, chief executive of London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said businesses would welcome being able to increase their capacity or \"kickstart their chosen future ways of working plans\".\n\"For London this is all hugely significant and is a further placing of the 'open for business' sign on the front door,\" he added.  \n\"Ultimately, the answer is yes\" - your employer can tell you to work from the office, according to Shah Qureshi, partner and head of employment at law firm Irwin Mitchel.\nHowever, Mr Qureshi adds that under the Health and Safety at Work Act, \"employers have an obligation to ensure that there is a safe working environment, a safe workplace, to which an employee returns\", which is irrespective of whether restrictions are abolished on 19 July.\nSo although all coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July, measures put in place by companies could still include spacing desks out, enforcing one-way walking systems and ensuring adequate sanitary facilities, to make sure their offices are safe. \n\"There is an obligation to return to the office where an employer requires you to do so, and your normal workplace is the office, but there is a duty of care that the employer has to ensure that everything is safe as far as possible,\" said Mr Qureshi.\nMr Qureshi added that as the law currently stands, there is no legal right for employees to work from home."

      "text": "More than 30 doctors, health professionals and campaigners have called for an \"urgent investigation\" into the Welsh government's handling of the Covid pandemic.\nNot holding an inquiry immediately will lead to unnecessary deaths, they said.\nIt comes after Newyddion S4C revealed 1,860 patients who died up to May 2021 \"definitely\" or \"probably\" were infected in hospital.\nSenedd opposition leaders said it showed the need for Wales' own inquiry.\nThe Welsh government has agreed to take part in a UK-wide public inquiry, saying it is the most appropriate way to scrutinise their decision making during the pandemic. \nIn an open letter the group, mostly made up of doctors working in the Welsh NHS, called for scrutiny of the \"decisions and actions undertaken\" so far so that lessons can be learned.\n35 signatories said delaying an investigation \"risks increasing pressure on an already overwhelmed NHS\".\n\"More importantly, avoiding an immediate official inquiry will certainly lead to further economic harm, long term incapacity and unnecessary loss of life.\"\nIt said a probe should examine how health care organisations can reduce deaths related within hospitals, and what support is offered to people with long Covid.\nAn investigation should also examine how to improve the Test, Trace and Protect system, it said.\nThe letter calls for an investigation \"undertaken without delay so that lessons can be learnt as we head into further waves of COVID-19 infections with the possibility of new vaccine resistant strains ahead and normal winter pressures\".\nSignatories include 26 doctors, former Labour MP Ann Clwyd and others from the Medics4MaskUpWales group.\nThe Welsh government has been asked to comment.\nIn the Senedd on Tuesday, Conservative group leader Andrew RT Davies said it was \"the wrong decision\" for the Welsh government not to hold its own inquiry.\n\"One in three people in certain health boards were acquiring the Covid virus in a hospital setting because of the decisions taken here in Wales,\" he said.\n\"People will be bemused that you're not prepared to put yourself under the spotlight of scrutiny.\"\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"I think, in all honesty, that opens you up to the charge of ducking scrutiny.\"\nStanding in for Mark Drakeford, Trefnydd (government business minister) Lesley Griffiths said the first minister had agreed to a four-nation inquiry because it would examine the \"inter-dependencies\" between the nations of the UK.\nThe Welsh government expected \"chapters to have a specific focus on Wales\", she said.\nShe said \"far too many people have died\".\n\"We have done everything we can, obviously, as have the hospitals and care homes themselves to keep the virus out,\" she told the Welsh Parliament.\n\"But of course it doesn't stop at the door of hospitals. It doesn't stop at the door of care homes.\"\nHospitals were like \"a small town\", adding: \"You are unable to stop the virus coming in, unfortunately.\"\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 7,100 probable and definite hospital infections have been recorded by Public Health Wales. \nThe figures have dropped back in recent weeks, reflecting a falling number of people in hospital with Covid. About 1% of all Covid infections are now acquired in hospital and the rest in the community."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings has redoubled his criticism of his old boss Boris Johnson, saying the PM cannot distinguish \"between truth and lies\".\nThe former top adviser said Mr Johnson \"lies so blatantly, so naturally, so regularly\" that he sees \"no real distinction\".\nIn a blog post, Mr Cummings claimed Mr Johnson \"regularly admits it's ludicrous he's prime minister\". \nThe PM's official spokesman rejected the former aide's claims about lying. \n\"I don't plan to engage with every allegation made,\" he added when asked about the blog by reporters on Monday.\nIt is the latest broadside against the PM from Mr Cummings since he was forced out of his No 10 role last year, following an internal power struggle.\nBut the former aide also defended his decision to join Mr Johnson's top team in 2019, despite believing him \"unfit to be PM\".\nIn a post to paying subscribers to his Substack website, Mr Cummings claimed Mr Johnson \"regularly admits it's ludicrous he's prime minister\".\nHe wrote that the PM is \"hopeless at bureaucratic infighting,\" and \"routinely says and does things so foolish that people are open-mouthed\".\nMr Cummings added he knew Mr Johnson was \"in any objective sense, unfit to be PM\" when he agreed to become his senior adviser in summer 2019. \nBut despite this, he added, he and former members of the Vote Leave campaign decided to \"roll the dice\" and join his No 10 team anyway, believing his defects could be \"partly mitigated\" in office.\nHe added that they also believed that, without their help, the Conservatives would fail to resolve the post-referendum \"constitutional crisis\".\nThis, he wrote, could have led to a second referendum and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn winning power, which would \"probably be an even bigger disaster\".\nHe also justified the move as a chance to deliver post-Brexit political reforms, adding they thought Mr Johnson's weaknesses could be \"turned to advantage\".\nHe wrote that Mr Johnson's \"ignorance of Whitehall\" and his \"desire to enjoy himself rather than work hard\" provided a \"very weird opportunity to force through certain important things that the system left to itself won't do\".\n\"Precisely because he doesn't know what he's doing, we may be able to get him to agree things 'the system' will think are 'extreme' but we think are necessary,\" he added. \n\"As often in politics the immediate prospect of a second referendum and Corbyn - with all the misery, poverty and damage to democracy this would bring - outweighed calculations about the distant future.\"\nDominic Cummings has been openly critical of the prime minister's abilities - or lack of them - before.\nIn his latest blog he suggests that the PM - who has intermittent spurts of self-awareness, according to his former aide - agreed with him.\nHe said in 2016 Boris Johnson told him it would be \"ludicrous\" for him to become prime minister.\nBut did Mr Johnson really believe that? \nAfter all, he is said to have uttered this self-assessment \"with a laugh\", and adding it was no more ludicrous than having David Cameron or George Osborne in No10.\nMr Cummings argues that a flawed Mr Johnson was better than the alternative of Jeremy Corbyn and a second referendum, but paints an unflattering picture of \"government by adviser\" - that Mr Johnson's apparent lack of interest in policy and aversion to hard work allowed his aides to step in and refocus the government's attention away from Brussels and towards science and technology.\nHis is only one side of the story, of course, and Mr Cummings will be keen to convince us that his decision to help Boris Johnson - whom he says is unfit to be PM - to call and win an election has had some lasting benefits.\nMr Cummings became an adviser to the prime minister in July 2019, when Mr Johnson entered No 10 after winning the Conservative Party leadership race, following the resignation of Theresa May.\nHe left his role late last year, following internal battles over his role as Mr Johnson's chief adviser.\nSince then he has used his personal blog, Twitter account and an appearance in May in front of MPs to criticise the government's Covid strategy and Mr Johnson personally. \nThis has included publishing text messages sent to him by Mr Johnson last year - including ones in which the PM apparently described former health secretary Matt Hancock as \"hopeless\".\nIn a subsequent post on Monday, he also took aim at the expected easing of the majority of England's remaining Covid rules on 19 July, adding it was \"obviously not\" the right call."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Face masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrapped at the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap, Boris Johnson has confirmed.\nThe rule of six inside private homes will be removed and work-from-home guidance abolished as 16 months of on-off restrictions on daily life end.\nThe PM said he expected the final step would go ahead as planned on 19 July. \nThis will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data.\nFurther updates on school bubbles, travel and self-isolation will follow in the coming days, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference.\nHe said that even after the removal of the legal requirement to wear a face covering, he would continue to wear one himself in crowded places \"as a courtesy\".\nMr Johnson said the ability to end a vast majority of legal restrictions in England was thanks to the success of the vaccine rollout in weakening the link between cases and deaths.\nBut he warned cases were predicted to rise to 50,000 a day later this month and that \"we must reconcile ourselves, sadly, to more deaths from Covid\".\nThe prime minister explained: \"If we don't go ahead now when we've clearly done so much with the vaccination programme to break the link... when would we go ahead?\"\nHe added: \"We run the risk of either opening up at a very difficult time when the virus has an edge, has an advantage, in the cold months, or again putting everything off to next year.\"\nSelf-isolation orders for those who test positive would continue, Mr Johnson said, but he suggested there would soon be new rules for fully-vaccinated contacts.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs he would probably make an announcement regarding a new regime for close contacts on Tuesday.\nNo country in the world has attempted to lift restrictions like this - in the face of rapidly rising cases driven by the new, more infectious Delta variant.\nSome say it would be better to wait until autumn when all adults will have had the chance to get a second vaccine dose.\nThat may sound good in principle, but scientists advising government seem to be backing a summer lifting.\nUnlocking was always going to drive up infections. And the problem with trying to delay that is the risk of a surge in cases at a much worse time.\nBy the autumn schools will be back - and we can see the huge disruption the rise in cases in recent weeks has had.\nPeople will also be outdoors more in the summer months, which could help flatten the peak.\nBut perhaps most importantly you risk running into the flu season.\nThat is when the NHS is under most pressure, while a Covid infection followed by flu in quick succession puts the vulnerable even more at risk.\nThe move is not without risk. The government is banking on the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme stemming these rises soon.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules. \nThe Scottish government has said it may continue to require masks in certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end.\nAhead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said people would need to learn to live with Covid. Rules in Northern Ireland have just eased, with another review due on 8 July.\nThe final stage of England's roadmap, step four, was delayed last month to no earlier than 19 July amid surging virus cases linked to the Delta variant.\nMr Johnson said step four should proceed on that date, subject to the 12 July review. \nAnnouncing what the next stage of the pandemic will look like in England, he confirmed:\nIt means nightclubs will reopen for the first time since the pandemic began, while drinks at the bar will return in a boost to the hospitality industry.\nSocial distancing requirements, including the 1m-plus rule, have prevented many venues from operating at full capacity during the pandemic.\nFace coverings are currently required, for those without an exemption, on public transport and in shops as part of regulations backed by law.\nThe prime minister said that while Covid certificates to prove vaccination or test status would not be legally mandated, businesses could choose to require them.\nResponding to Mr Johnson's announcement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"lifting all protections in one go, when the infection rate is going up, is reckless\". \n\"A balanced approach or proper plan would say keep protections,\" he added, suggesting the use of masks in enclosed spaces and on public transport.\nSpeaking alongside Mr Johnson, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty outlined the three scenarios where he would continue to wear a face covering in the context of rising case numbers.\n\"The first is any situation which is indoors, crowded, or indoors with close proximity with other people... the second situation I'd do it is if I was required to by any competent authority... and the third reason is if someone else was uncomfortable if I did not wear a mask,\" he said.\nProf Whitty warned this coming winter \"may be very difficult for the NHS\", as chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the link between cases, hospital admission and death had been \"weakened, not broken\" by the vaccines.\nOn the vaccine roll-out, Mr Johnson said the gap between first and second vaccine jabs for the under-40s will be shortened from 12 weeks to eight.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson will announce more details on Tuesday about how schools will manage isolation in future, the prime minister added.\nBut he confirmed pupils will no longer be sent home en masse within so-called school bubbles.\nA further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, alongside another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

      "tags": "Manufacturing,Companies,Ellesmere Port,Vauxhall Motors,Car industry,Green vehicles",
      "text": "Vauxhall owner Stellantis has announced plans to build electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire.\nThe \u00a3100m investment, which the UK government will contribute to, will safeguard more than 1,000 factory jobs.\nThe future of the plant has been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company scrapped plans to build its new Astra model there.\nThe Ellesmere Port plant will also make electric passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn.\nProduction of an all-electric van will start in 2022, the carmaker said.\nThe government has held talks with Stellantis about options for the Cheshire factory and ministers are understood to have offered about \u00a330m in financial support.\nCarlos Tavares, head of Stellantis, had previously warned that the company would no longer invest in pure diesel or petrol cars at the plant, and said a decision on where it would build electric vehicles would depend on the UK government's support of the car sector.\nMr Tavares said: \"Performance is always the trigger for sustainability and this \u00a3100m investment demonstrates our commitment to the UK and to Ellesmere Port.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port, and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships.\" \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \"Ellesmere Port's proud tradition in auto manufacturing will continue for many years to come thanks to today's investment.\"\nHe said that the investment will also \"secure thousands of jobs across the region in the supply chain\".\n\"In this global race to secure electric vehicle production, we are proud to support Britain's auto sector in this crucial transition as we work to build back better,\" Mr Kwarteng added.\nSales of vans have been booming during the pandemic, as a result of growing home delivery sales.\nVauxhall's Luton plant is currently operating at full capacity so Stellantis wants to expand production at Ellesmere Port to serve the UK market.\nLike other manufacturers it is also preparing for an all-electric future. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with other European countries setting similar targets.\nLast week, Japanese carmaker Nissan announced an expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs.\nHollie Hughes, 24, an engineer at the Ellesmere Port plant, who started as an apprentice nearly eight years ago, said the plans were \"so exciting\", especially the electric vehicle aspect.\n\"It's a massive highlight for Ellesmere Port,\" she said, adding that her team will be \"heavily involved\" in implementing the plans.\nOliver Holden, 27, a manufacturing engineer at the plant, said the employees had waited a long time for the announcement.\n\"From today, everyone will be pleased - the mood will be lifted, I believe,\" he said. \"Everyone now can focus on the next challenges and move towards the future.\"\nProfessor David Bailey, an economist at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme that Vauxhall's plans would support jobs in the short term, but there was a question over how sustainable they would make Ellesmere Port. \n\"There is there is no [Stellantis electric vehicle] battery plant being built in the UK... so if batteries are being brought in from France and elsewhere, that's going to add to costs and it's going leave Ellesmere Port as a relatively high-cost location,\" he said. \n\"[Building one in the UK] would really anchor vehicle production at Stellantis at Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK.\n\"Longer term we're going to need a lot of batteries in the UK and we will need battery plants to keep mass car and vehicle production here.\" \nStellantis is currently building two battery plants, one in France and one in Germany, and is looking to establish a third, rumoured to be in Italy.\nThe two \"gigafactories\" at Douvrin in France and Kaiserslautern in Germany will get French and German government support of \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a31.1bn).\nThe Ellesmere Port plant will have a new body shop and investment in general assembly and on site battery pack assembly. Work will begin on potential wind and solar farms at the site.\nStellantis will also consult on the creation of a UK parts distribution centre which will require further investment.\nThe outlook for the British automotive industry is certainly a lot rosier now than it was just a few months ago.  \nWithout investment in new products every few years, car plants die; and the ageing factory at Ellesmere Port has long been regarded as particularly vulnerable.  \nEarlier this year Carlos Tavares, the acerbic chief executive of Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis, made it very clear that investment would only arrive if the government itself were prepared to support the industry.\nIt appears the government has done just that, with both Nissan and Stellantis, pledging to spend serious amounts of money developing electric vehicles here as a result.\nBut there's a long way to go to secure the future of car manufacturing, as it prepares for an all-electric future. After years of uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit, which made carmakers reluctant to commit to new plans, the UK is still playing catch-up.\nSo while the news from Nissan and Vauxhall has been widely welcomed, people within the sector agree that much more is needed.\nStellantis is the world's fifth-largest carmaker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler.\nEllesmere Port, acquired by Vauxhall Motors in 1957 from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, initially developed the site as a sub-assembly and engine production line for its Dunstable and Luton factories.\nIt produced its first car, the Vauxhall Viva, in 1964, and produced the Viva, Chevette, and Vauxhall and Opel Astra.\nEmployment peaked at the site in 1975, with 12,000 people on staff."

      "tags": "Television,BBC,Radio",
      "text": "Gary Lineker remains the BBC's top earner despite agreeing to a pay cut of just under \u00a3400,000, the broadcaster has revealed in its annual report.\nLast year it was announced the Match of the Day host had agreed to his wages being reduced.\nTuesday's report showed he earned \u00a31.36m in the 2020/21 financial year, down from \u00a31.75m.\nRadio 2's Zoe Ball, who also took a pay cut after offering to do so, is still the second-highest paid star on \u00a31.13m.\nLast year she earned the same as Lineker's earnings in the latest financial year - \u00a31.36m.\nHer current salary is actually \u00a3980,000, a reduction of 28% from 2019/2020 - the \u00a31.13m figure takes into account her wages before she took the pay cut towards the end of last year.\nThe wage bill for all on-air talent overall has been cut by 10% to \u00a3130m - down from \u00a3144m last year. Wages for broadcasters earning more than \u00a3150,000 have been reduced by \u00a32.2m.\nThe BBC's director general Tim Davie said most of the renegotiations about pay with top stars had been \"mutual and constructive\".\n\"Clearly, as a management team, we want to get more value and we're willing to make tough decisions to that extent,\" he said.\n\"But I think these conversations have all been constructive - as with Zoe Ball when she came forward and said she wanted to adjust her salary. I think everyone is absolutely with the programme on that one.\"\nHe added that \"we should maintain restraint in pay across the top talent\" and would \"continue to look for efficiency\" savings in the future.\nBut Conservative MP Julian Knight, who is the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS), said: \"It's welcome that some of the BBC's top-earners have agreed to 'significant reductions' in their salaries this year. Yet despite taking a pay cut, Gary Lineker is still earning \u00a31.36 million.\"\nFive of the six top earners - including Steve Wright, Huw Edwards and Question Time anchor Fiona Bruce - now earn less than they did last year. Radio 5 Live presenter Stephen Nolan, in joint-fifth place, saw his salary increased by \u00a315,000.\nFour women - Ball, Bruce, Radio 2's Vanessa Feltz and Lauren Laverne of 6 Music - make the top 10, the same number as last year.\nThere are 31 women on the list and 40 men, a split of 44%/56%, despite the previous director general Tony Hall pledging that the gap would be closed by 2020.\nAgain like last year, all of the top 10 earners are white. While 20% of all presenters earning over \u00a3150,000 are from ethnic minority backgrounds, up from 18% last year, the overall staff pay gap for minorities has widened slightly.\nGraham Norton, who left his Radio 2 show in December 2020, dropped out of the top 10 entirely. The star earned \u00a3150,000 in 2020/2021.\nHe also fronts the BBC's Eurovision coverage - although the event was cancelled last year due to the pandemic.\nCovid cancellations tell part of the story when it comes to savings - for example, Sue Barker and John McEnroe didn't cover Wimbledon after the event was pulled last year.\nMr Davie said there had been \"quite a lot\" of \"little reductions\" because most major sporting, cultural and political events did not take place last year - but that most pay cuts were \"structural\".\nSince 2017, the BBC has been made to publish the names of those earning more than \u00a3150,000 each year, a move instigated by the government, and Lineker has topped the list on each occasion.\nHowever, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend.\nNorton's TV chat show, for instance, does not appear on the report for that reason.\nClaudia Winkelman also disappears from the list, as Strictly Come Dancing isn't counted either. She replaced Norton on Saturday mornings on Radio 2 in February, so that will be reflected in next year's list.\nThe number of senior leaders at the BBC is down from 253 to 241, the report also says.\nThis annual report covers an exceptional year. Despite the usual supply of controversy, from the Proms to Lord Dyson's report on the Princess Diana interview, there are deep trends within this pandemic year which show the BBC to be pursuing a clear strategy under its new leadership. \nFirst, reach: 6.1bn streams on iPlayer represents 28% growth, an extraordinary performance. Average time spent with the BBC each also grew. In the current global market, that is remarkable. \nSecond, leanness: Tim Davie, director general since September, is a commercial creature, and wants efficiency. This has caused ructions and even distress within the BBC, with many staff leaving or having to re-apply for jobs. But it has also led to big reductions in overall public sector staff, and also the wage bill for on-air stars.\nFinally, education, the third pillar of the BBC's Reithian mission to \"inform, educate, and entertain\", has renewed its centrality to the corporation. Consumption of educational programming has soared, fortifying the connection between the BBC and young Britons.\nWill they pay for a licence fee? They might not, which means the pressure on the BBC's commercial arm, which has ambitious targets, will grow. But ahead of negotiations with the government next year, Davie and Richard Sharp, the chairman since February, can point to clear evidence of continued high demand for what the BBC does.\nMr Knight called for the BBC to \"commit to full transparency on its talent bill and drop the smoke and mirrors approach\" following the publication of the report.\n\"There remains a concerning lack of transparency because a number of top-earning stars are paid through BBC Studios and their salaries don't appear here.\"\nHowever, in an earlier press briefing, Mr Davie said it was \"absolutely appropriate\" that the broadcaster did not reveal BBC Studios pay and that he would \"defend robustly\" the current system.\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp pointed to the corporation's work during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying: \"During a profound trauma for the nation, almost overnight we reconfigured all the BBC's output around the most urgent needs of the country. The speed and the agility of the response was exceptional, and they continue to demonstrate very clearly the enduring importance of the BBC is core mission to inform, educate and entertain.\"\nHe warned about \"super inflation\" in production with competition from global giants, saying: \"The cost of some of our biggest series have more than doubled.\n\"Yet despite these pressures, the BBC has proved itself to be resilient and relevant and competitive.\"\nNine out of 10 adults use the BBC every week, and they spend an average of 18 hours and two minutes watching, listening or reading - up from 17 hours 45 minutes last year.\nHowever, those figures fall markedly for younger audiences. Overall, 80% of people aged between 16 and 34 used the BBC every week, falling to 77% for under-16s.\nAmong the 16-34 age group, 51% watched BBC TV every week and 47% listened to BBC radio.\nThe BBC's total workforce has reduced by over 1,200 - that's a 6% decrease.\nBBC Studios - the corporation's commercial arm - suffered a drop in sales of 10% and profits were down 17%, although those figures were due to production pauses and constraints during the pandemic.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Wales is going to have to \"learn to live with\" coronavirus, the nation's health minister has said.\nEluned Morgan spoke ahead of the UK government's announcement that it will scrap most Covid restrictions in England.\nThe Welsh government is yet to reveal its next moves, but they could be announced a week on Wednesday.\n\"Other harms\" caused by lockdown such as mental health issues were being considered, the minister said.\nThe Welsh government is increasingly confident the current Covid wave will cause less serious illness than before due to mass vaccination. \nBut Baroness Morgan said the Welsh government would not move to a \"political deadline that has been set out artificially\" by the UK government for England.\nThe Conservatives called for Labour to give a plan for freedoms to be restored, while Plaid Cymru said the Welsh government needed to be \"up front\" about the data.\nIt comes after a senior Welsh government politician said more of Wales' rules could move from being legal requirements to advice.\nCoronavirus cases continue to rise in Wales - the health minister said it now stands at 95 cases per 100,000 people.\nShe added there had a been a small increase in the number of people in hospital in Wales with Covid in the last few days, numbering around 100.\n\"We believe vaccination has weakened the link between the virus and hospitalisation, even in the face of the new delta variant,\" the minister told a televised briefing.\nOn the possible easing of restrictions, she said Wales was still in a \"very difficult situation because the case numbers are increasing exponentially\".\nHowever, she added: \"We need to understand that we are going to learn to live with this with this illness.\n\"And we are going to have to adapt as a society to a situation where we will be exposed to an extent to this new variant, and to coronavirus more generally.\"\nCan you spot any difference?\n\"People must begin to learn to live with this virus\", Downing Street is briefing journalists in England. \n\"We are going to learn to live with this illness,\" according to Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan.\nRemarkably similar language - radically different approaches to lifting restrictions.\nThe expectation is that England will do away with the vast majority of Covid rules on 19 July, whilst Scotland is aiming to get rid of most of its regulations on 9 August.\nBut in Wales, where transmission of the virus is at its lowest compared to the other UK nations, there is still no mention of a timescale, let alone any indication of whether we're heading in the same direction.\nThe Welsh government's cabinet will meet several times over the next 10 days to pore over the data, with particular focus on the impact on hospitals, ahead of an announcement next week, perhaps as early as Wednesday 14 July.\nIf the pressure on hospitals remains low, there will be huge political pressure on ministers to articulate what learning to live with the virus actually means.\nBecause as it stands, we're none the wiser.\nBaroness Morgan said that having seen a \"weakening\" of the link between cases and hospital admissions, \"we also have to understand that there are other harms that we need to consider and, in particular, the mental health situation, the economic situation, the social situations that people find themselves in\".\n\"We'll be considering those in the next few days,\" she added.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on Monday that face mask and social distancing rules in England will be scrapped from 19 July.\nOn whether Wales would follow England, Baroness Morgan said that \"in an ideal world we would like to move together\", but added: \"If it's not right for Wales, we won't be doing that.\" \n\"We've responded to local circumstances and we will continue to do that,\" she said. \nAs things stand before next week's announcement, England will have different rules on face coverings and social distancing from 19 July.\nOne business woman in the border town of Chepstow said shoppers may avoid the town if they could go somewhere nearby in England where they did not have to wear one.\nLisa Roberts, of J'adore gift shop, said customers are \"refusing to wear them sometimes\" for reasons like glasses misting up and lip reading.\n\"People will bypass Chepstow and go somewhere else, because they just don't want the hassle of wearing one,\" she said.\nDawn Floyd, of St Mary's Collectables in the same town, said if the rules were different between the two countries she doubted that she could challenge her customers if they were not wearing a mask.\n\"How are we going to enforce somebody coming in from England to wear a facemask when it's basically a few 100 yards down the road. I can't see how we can possibly enforce that,\" said Ms Floyd.\n\"I don't think that would be fair to have to sort of confront them to say you can't come in unless you have a face mask,\" she added.\nDespite low rates of Covid admissions, NHS Wales Chief Executive Andrew Goodall said the NHS was struggling to \"catch its breath\" with a backlog of planned operations due to continued Covid-control measures.\nHe told Monday's briefing that 86% of hospital beds in Wales were occupied at the end of last week, with the vast majority of admissions unrelated to Covid.\n\"Demand for urgent and emergency care is back to pre-pandemic levels, and at times it is even busier,\" Dr Goodall said.\nWelsh Conservative's health spokesman, Russell George, said: \"It's long been clear we would have to learn to live with this virus, and it's encouraging Labour ministers are starting to be up front and honest with the Welsh public.\"\nHe added: \"Over the coming days, Labour ministers should start providing the country with clarity, hope and their plan for the restoration of freedoms in Wales - it's the least families, workers and business deserve.\"\nPlaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Welsh government needs to be up-front about what the data is telling them, specifically on how the vaccination programme has impacted on the number of people becoming seriously ill as a result of infection.\n\"I, for one, am hoping that the data tells a positive story so we can move forward.\""

      "text": "Mandatory Covid passports have been scrapped in England, and their use has been scaled down in Northern Ireland. \nHowever, venues can choose to keep using the scheme on a voluntary basis if they wish, and Scotland and Wales retain their own systems.\nCovid passes are no longer mandatory in any venue, as part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures.\nAnnouncing the change, the prime minister said venues could continue to ask customers to provide evidence of their vaccination status or a recent negative test if they wished.\nEngland's scheme previously applied to:\nYou could only enter these venues if could show:\nProof of natural immunity - for instance, a positive PCR test taken in the past six months - was not accepted as an alternative to proof of vaccination or a recent test.\nSome large events weren't included in the rules, including communal worship, wedding ceremonies, funerals, protests and mass-participation sporting events (such as a marathon).\nIts Covid passport scheme is no longer mandatory for pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres - although venues are being encouraged to carry on using it. \nHowever, Covid passes are still required for entry to:\nPeople can either show proof of vaccination, proof of a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours, or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30 to 180 days.\nThe COVIDCert NI app can be used to show proof of vaccination, or a paper version can be requested.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that its Covid pass scheme is not being extended to cinemas and theatres for the time being. \nHowever, they are still required for entry to:\nEvent organisers  are being asked to review 50% or 1,000 vaccine passports of attendees, whichever figure is higher, and a booster will be required to count as fully vaccinated if your second dose was more than four months ago.\nUnder Scotland's scheme, proof of vaccination or a negative test within 24 hours can be shown with the NHS Scotland Covid Status App, the NHS App (if from England or Wales) or Covidcert NI app (if from Northern Ireland) - a printed paper version is also acceptable.\nUnder-18s are exempt, as are vaccine trial participants, and those who couldn't be vaccinated for medical reasons.\nPeople need to show their NHS Covid Pass to gain entry to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nPrior to the current restrictions - which are due to be lifted in the coming weeks - the scheme also applied to nightclubs and comparable venues, unseated indoor live events for more than 500 people, unseated outdoor live events for more than 4,000 people and any event for more than 10,000 people.\nOver-16s who have been fully vaccinated in Wales or England can use the pass to prove their status, but it's only compulsory for over-18s.\nPeople can show a negative LFT result instead of proof of vaccination, but this must now have been done within the previous 24 hours and not 48 hours.\nIn England, the government says venues which didn't comply with the rules could face prosecution or a fixed penalty notice ranging from \u00a31,000 to \u00a310,000.\nIn Wales, fixed penalty notices can be issued up to a maximum of \u00a310,000. That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "Shoppers are starting to return to pre-pandemic habits when it comes to buying food, according to two leading grocers.\nSainsbury's says demand for online sales has fallen from peak levels as people return to shopping in stores. \nBoss Simon Roberts also said mask wearing in stores would be a matter of \"personal choice\" after Covid rules are lifted in England on 19 July.\nMeanwhile online grocer Ocado said average order sizes have been falling as people start to eat out more often.\nHowever, both Sainsbury's and Ocado said online sales were way above pre-pandemic levels. Sainsbury's says 18% of its sales are online, compared with 8% in 2019-20.\nSainsbury's - the UK's second largest supermarket chain - also said online sales jumped 29% in the first quarter of its financial year compared with last year, and were 142% higher than before coronavirus struck. \nHowever, it added: \"As restrictions continue to ease, customers are beginning to return to more normal shopping patterns, with online demand reducing gradually from peak levels and transaction numbers increasing in stores.\" \nTrading overall at Sainsbury's was stronger than expected in the 16 weeks to 26 June. with sales up by 1.6% from a year earlier.\nThe retailer said there were a number of areas of concern, however, including potential price pressures from rising commodity prices and freight costs. \nMr Roberts also said the business was facing challenges from a shortage of HGV drivers and there had been an increase in staff absence because of Covid. \nHe said he would consult staff on their views on face masks, but said the decision to wear one would be down to individual choice.\n\"There are two very distinct points of view. One is customers and colleagues who can't wait for the restrictions to lift and not to have to wear a mask for example, and others who are keen to continue to do that,\" Mr Roberts said.\n\"I think in the end it will come down to the choices that individual customers and colleagues want to make. It is going to be driven by customer and by colleague choice.\"\nOcado said its retail revenues - which covers its joint venture with Marks and Spencer - had grown 19.8% to \u00a31.2bn in the six months to 30 May.\nHowever, it added: \"With the easing of social distancing restrictions meaning fewer meals consumed at home, basket sizes in the second quarter have begun to move toward pre-Covid-19 levels, exiting the period 10% lower than the average for the half.\""

      "text": "People in England are no longer legally required to wear face masks in almost all public spaces, although they are still recommended in some settings. \nThe change is part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures in England.\nMasks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nFrom Thursday 27 January:\nWhat are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?\nFace mask changes: 'We hope customers aren't discouraged'\nIn Scotland, masks must be worn in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).\nThey must be worn in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, and in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. \nThey are compulsory for all school staff as well as secondary school pupils and are required in indoor public spaces in universities.\nLike England, under-12s are exempt.\nFrom Friday 28 January, adults running organised sessions with under-5s will no longer need to wear face coverings. \nIn Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils must wear face coverings inside school buildings, as must staff if they can't socially distance.\nMasks must also be worn on public transport, in shops and hospitality venues unless you're sitting down to eat or drink.\nMasks aren't required in gyms or other exercise venues.\nHowever, people no longer have to show proof of exemption if they're not wearing a mask.\nUnder-13s don't have to wear masks in public indoor places, and primary school pupils are exempt from the rules on public transport.\nPeople no longer have to wear face masks by law in cafes, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, but face coverings are required on public transport and  most public spaces, including shops.\nSecondary school pupils are being asked to wear masks in class until the end of half term. \nThe guidance in Wales applies to everyone aged 11 or over.\nIn England, Transport for London (TfL) officers and police can currently fine people \u00a3200 for their first offence. This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."
