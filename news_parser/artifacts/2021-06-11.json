      "title": "Brewdog boss vows to learn after 'toxic culture' criticism",
      "tags": "Ellon,Companies,BrewDog",
      "text": "A co-founder of Brewdog has promised to listen and learn from savage criticism of the beer company by 60 ex-staff.\nJames Watt told the BBC claims of a \"culture of fear\" and \"toxic attitude\" were tough to hear, but said they would help make him a better chief executive.\nIn an open letter, signatories said a \"significant number\" of former staff had \"suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog\".\nAnd they aren't happy with the apology, saying: \"We aren't going away\".\nMr Watt said it was clear some things had gone wrong at the company. \"We genuinely apologise,\" he said.\nBut the signatories have focused on a separate comment appearing to come from Mr Watt on Thursday, which they say illustrates his \"true disregard\" for his staff.\nIn the first letter, the ex-staff claimed that the firm was built around a \"cult of personality\" of founders Mr Watt and Martin Dickie.\nThe fast-growing Scottish brewer and pub chain has enjoyed rapid success and now employs 2,000 staff. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions. \nThe letter, posted on Twitter, made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.\nIt said Mr Watt and Mr Dickie had exploited publicity, \"both good and bad\", to further their own business goals and chased \"growth, at all costs\".\nIt added: \"You spent years claiming you wanted to be the best employer in the world, presumably to help you to recruit top talent, but ask former staff what they think of those claims, and you'll most likely be laughed at. \n\"Being treated like a human being was sadly not always a given for those working at Brewdog.\"\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Watt said: \"It's very clear, looking at the feedback, we haven't always got things right here.\n\"We have to see this feedback as an opportunity to get better. We have to learn, we have to act. We have to take it on the chin.\"\nMr Watt would not confirm if the allegations were true, but said: \"For me, it's not about disputing individual claims. But 60 people were unhappy and we have to get better. That's the only way we can get something good out of this situation.\"\nOne of the many criticisms was that Brewdog management operated a culture of fear, with staff afraid to speak out - even after they had left.\nThat culture has not prevented dozens more former Brewdog staff speaking up in response to the publicity around the letter. The letter now has more than 250 signatories, its unnamed authors said.\nThey have issued a follow-up letter, addressed to Mr Watt, in which they thank him for his apology but say that they have gathered many further examples of bad practice at the company. \nThey also voiced strong objections to an earlier message that was circulated to current Brewdog staff as an immediate reaction to their first letter of complaint.\nThat note, from James Watt, said: \"It is fair to say that this type of fast-paced and intense environment is definitely not for everyone, but many of our fantastic long-term team members have thrived in our culture. Our culture is built on rewarding and developing great people and focussing on growing our business.\"\nThe group of ex-staff said: \"We want you to know that we categorically refute everything suggested in this statement.\n\"Many of our signatories worked for Brewdog for years, and were extremely high-performing. To suggest that those who apparently couldn't hack it are somehow less worthy in your eyes is grotesque; we believe this shows your true feelings of disregard for your staff, both former and current.\"\nThe group said it would continue to monitor what action was taken to address these issues.\nIn his BBC interview Mr Watt admitted that the company's rapid growth had been a steep learning curve. \"But the buck stops with me. I will use [the criticism] to be a better chief executive and leader.\"\nHe said the company will embark on a series of anonymous surveys of current staff \"and do some listening groups\".\nHowever, Brewdog's rapid expansion - the source of much of the problems, ex-staff claim - would continue, he said: \"It's not about slowing the growth, because that's in our DNA.\"\nThe challenge now would be how Brewdog can maintain the intensity of its expansion, \"yet be a better employer,\" he said.\nBrewdog started out in 2007, being passionate about craft beer and contemptuous of rival big brewers. It's become at least as passionate about growth, by unconventional \"punk\" means. \nSo far, there is a big brewery in Aberdeenshire, plus others in Berlin, Brisbane and Columbus, Ohio. There are more than 100 Brewdog bars dotted across the world map. And a new project is beer-themed hotels, in Ohio, Manchester and Edinburgh.\nThis has been funded through the sale of a big chunk of the business to private equity and several rounds of crowdfunding. The AGM in Aberdeen has become something of a party.\nBut it seems the combined publicity-thirsty passion for beer and growth has been bruising. Every employer has disgruntled ex-employees. Usually, once dispersed, they moan into their beer. But in this case, these ex-staff signatories have taken their passion for beer and applied it to improving working conditions in their industry.\nCo-founder James Watt concedes he didn't always \"get things right\". He dispensed with the usual combative defiance. His response is chastened, recognising that the accusations could be damaging to the brand and to recruitment. \nHe has become very successful by inviting drinkers to buy into products infused with the passion of beer people. So this runs counter to the values of clubby comradeship. Repairing the damage will take more nuance than Brewdog usually deploys."

      "text": "First Minister Mark Drakeford has accused England's health secretary of making \"simply factually untrue\" comments about Wales' vaccine rollout.\nMatt Hancock said Wales had a faster programme because it could draw on England's supply if needed.\nBut Mr Drakeford said Wales' success was based on the management of its own stocks, not any extra supply from the UK government.\nWales currently has one of the best vaccination programmes in the world.\nPeople aged 25 to 29 in England can book to have their first dose of Covid vaccine, while in Wales nearly two thirds of 18 to 29-year-olds have had at least one dose of a vaccine.\nLatest figures on Friday, showed more than 300,000 people aged under 30 in Wales had been given a first doses, joining similar numbers in their 30s.\nMr Hancock told MPs England had a slower rollout due to its \"buffer\" of supply.\nHe said UK ministers needed to make sure there was always enough supply for second doses, while Wales could draw on England's supply if needed\nBut Mr Drakeford told the BBC's Newsnight: \"It's simply factually untrue. \n\"We've drawn nothing out of an English buffer, we manage our own stocks and the fact that we have some of the best vaccination rates in the world is just because of the way in which the programme in Wales has been organised and delivered.\"\nMr Drakeford also said he was not prepared to follow England by announcing a date when all freedoms would be restored in Wales.\n\"I think it's too optimistic to say that vaccination has broken the link between falling ill and hospitalisation with the new Delta variant,\" he said. \n\"We really don't know that sufficiently to be confident that the vaccination is going to defend us in exactly that way.\n\"Wales is very largely free already. A great majority of things that people weren't able to do before, they're able to do already.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Wales was \"extremely fortunate to enjoy a world-leading vaccination programme\" but said it would not have been possible with a Labour government in Westminster.\n\"Let's make no bones about it. This first-class programme wouldn't have been possible if Labour had been calling the shots as Wales and the rest of Britain would have been stuck in the EU scheme,\" he said."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,G7 summits,Brexit,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has described US President Joe Biden as a \"breath of fresh air\" after they met for the first time on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall.\n\"There's so much that they want to do together with us, from security, NATO, to climate change,\" Mr Johnson said.\nHe also said there was \"complete harmony\" with Mr Biden over Northern Ireland.\nThe US, UK and EU all want to protect the Good Friday Agreement, the PM said. \nIt comes after Mr Biden had earlier warned that the UK-EU dispute over border controls should not risk the peace process in Northern Ireland.\nThe Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998, helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\nMr Johnson said he was \"optimistic\" the peace process would be kept going and that there is \"absolutely common ground\" on the issue between the two leaders. \nDuring their meeting, the two men also established a taskforce to re-establish travel across the Atlantic, after the US banned most British people from entering at the start of the pandemic.\nAnd they agreed a deal - labelled the \"Atlantic Charter\" - which commits the two countries to work together on global challenges.\nMr Johnson said: \"It's incredibly important that we should affirm that [relationship] and the talks were great, they went on for a long time, we covered a huge range of subjects, and it's wonderful to listen to the Biden administration and to Joe Biden.\"\nMr Biden said the \"Atlantic Charter\" would address the \"key challenges of this century - cyber security, emerging technologies, global health and climate change\".\n\"We affirmed the special relationship - that is not said lightly - the special relationship between our people and renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share,\" he added.\nEarlier, the leaders posed for photographs with their wives and the four exchanged gifts, with keen cyclist Mr Johnson receiving a US-made bike and helmet. \nMr Johnson gave the president a photo of Frederick Douglass - a former slave who campaigned against slavery in the 19th Century - and a first edition of Daphne du Maurier's The Apple Tree, a collection of short stories, to First Lady Jill Biden.\nThe G7 summit begins on Friday and will be the first time world leaders have assembled in person since the coronavirus pandemic.\nThey will be joined by the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who will all attend the G7 leaders' reception on Friday evening. \nAfterwards, Prince Charles will host a reception for the G7 leaders and CEOs from the world's largest companies to discuss how the private sector can work with governments to tackle the climate emergency, with Prince William also attending.  \nCovid vaccines and climate change will be among the main issues on the G7 agenda. \nBut the on-going disagreement between the UK and the EU over post-Brexit regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from Great Britain also look set to feature heavily in diplomatic discussions.  \nThe arrangements were agreed in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal, but the UK has since sought more flexibility.\nAsked about the dispute on Thursday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"I think it's not serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December.\n\"We have a trade deal - it has been painfully discussed for years... if six months later, they say: 'What we negotiated with you, we don't know how to respect it', then that means that nothing is respectable anymore.\"\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the Northern Ireland protocol - the name for the post-Brexit trading rules - was the \"only solution\" and should be implemented fully.\nNorthern Ireland was given special status as a result of the 2019 Brexit \"divorce\" settlement between the UK and the EU.\nWhile England, Scotland and Wales no longer follow EU rules, Northern Ireland still does, because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nIn order to avoid a physical border between the two countries - and thereby protect the peace process - it was agreed that customs checks would take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK.\nBut unionists say this has effectively put a border down the Irish Sea instead - something they are ideologically opposed to - and business say supply chains have been complicated and disrupted. \nTalks on Wednesday between Brexit minister Lord Frost and the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to try to resolve the standoff ended without a breakthrough.\nSince becoming president, Mr Biden has frequently stressed the importance of the Good Friday Agreement, which was brokered by the US.\nAnd speaking before the summit, the president's national security adviser told the BBC that Mr Biden has \"deep\" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in the region.\nAsked if Mr Biden made his alarm about the situation in Northern Ireland clear, Mr Johnson replied: \"No, he didn't.\"\nBefore the meeting, Mrs Biden and Mrs Johnson joined their husbands in Cornwall for a walk in Carbis Bay.\nAdmiring the view, Mr Biden said: \"It's gorgeous - I don't want to go home.\"\nThe two women dipped their feet in the sea and later had tea together.\nDr Biden told reporters: \"It's really nice to be here in Cornwall. It's my first time. Obviously it's beautiful for those of you who have been here before.\"\nMr Biden suggested that both he and the prime minister had \"married way above our stations\" - something with which Mr Johnson agreed.\nThe prime minister married his partner Carrie in a low-key wedding in Westminster Cathedral, at the end of May."

      "tags": "Mexico",
      "text": "Like all horror stories, Georgia Laurie's started innocuously enough.\nIn a vibrant hostel in a tucked-away corner of Puerto Escondido, Mexico, Georgia now sits, freshly discharged from hospital, tapping on her phone and surrounded by fellow backpackers, trying to make sense of the past few days.\nCertainly, it is the stuff of nightmares.\nShe and her twin sister, Melissa, from Berkshire in southern England, decided with a few friends to join a riverboat tour of the nearby Manialtepec Lagoon. It is a hauntingly beautiful place - a site of unspoilt natural beauty, its mangroves teem with Mexico's rich wildlife and birds.\nHowever, its shallows are also the natural habitat for crocodiles, and unbeknown to the group, this is hatching season.\n\"I actually said to the guide, 'this looks like a place where crocodiles make their home'\", Georgia told me with a wry smile. The bandage wrapped tightly around her wrist is evidence that she was right.\nThe guide - apparently a German national who was not registered with the tourism authority and has since fled - insisted it was safe to swim. As the group enjoyed a dip in the cool of the early afternoon (not a midnight swim as was initially reported), Melissa was suddenly tugged underwater.\n\"It was terrifying, wasn't it\", Georgia says turning to other people in the group who were there, who nod in agreement.\nIn what one local conservationist tells me was most likely a female crocodile defending its hatchlings, the animal went for Melissa on three separate occasions, puncturing her stomach and leg.\nYet rather than watch on helplessly, Georgia dived into action, punching the crocodile over and again on its nose.\n\"It was fight or flight,\" she remembers, \"and you have to fight for the people you love\".\nOne of the friends, Ani, scrambled onto the mangroves and called for help. A nearby boat with a different tour group, heard the cries and headed towards the commotion.\n\"I pushed through the undergrowth using my oar,\" says Lalo Escamilla, the boatman and local ornithologist who waded into the shallow waters to help the twins. \nLalo took me to the site where the attack happened and explained that properly-trained boatmen like him are worried that the irresponsible actions of a rogue guide could harm their business.\n\"They're not guides,\" he says of the foreigners who live in Puerto Escondido and who round up tourists for cheap boat trips, undercutting the locals. \"They're not federally-approved experts, they don't know this place. That's the problem.\"\nOnce on board, it was clear that Melissa's injuries were life-threatening. As well as the lacerations and deep cuts, there was water in her lungs and her wrist was broken.  She would later develop sepsis from her ruptured intestine.\nSuch was the adrenaline pumping around Georgia's body, she didn't realise the extent of her own injuries until they reached a private hospital in the town.\n\"It wasn't until the nurse opened my fist to clean my hand that I realised that it had been slashed too,\" Georgia said. Understandably, all her focus had been on her twin sister, who by then had been placed into a medically-induced coma. \nMaking the call to her parents was the next tough moment as it was around 04:00 in the UK.\n\"When they told me her condition was deteriorating, I had to let the family know.\"\nThankfully, Melissa has now emerged from the coma. After I sat and spoke to Georgia, she went to visit her sister in the hospital and says she is already looking stronger.\n\"We are all so happy,\" Georgia told me in a text.\nHowever, the road to full recovery will be a long one. The Mexican doctors and the British Embassy have been \"great\", Georgia says. \nBut Melissa must overcome her physical injuries and both women will need time to deal with the emotional and mental fallout of what they have been through. Georgia says she's struggling to sleep and that the images of the attack continue to crowd her thoughts.\nWhat she can count on - at least until her family arrives in Mexico - is the spirit of camaraderie among the other travellers and backpackers she is with. \nAlready they've formed a tight unit, a combination of friends from the UK, France, India and beyond who suddenly found one of their number under the full glare of the world's media for the most unlikely of situations.\nThe \"hero twin sister\" label isn't sitting comfortably with Georgia just yet. \nFor now, she just wants a chance to recover from their horrific ordeal, and to breathe again after almost being dragged under for good.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

She was seen saying: \"I failed... I just have to not stress about it.\"\nShe said she was \"bummed\" about the result, which was \"a little bit worse\" than her first attempt earlier this year. She added: \"I just have to do better in the future.\"\nThe reality star was taking the baby bar exam, a one-day test that is taken after a year's study. She pledged to take the exam for a third time later this month.\nShe has said she wants to open her own law firm focusing on sentencing and prison reform after finishing her law degree.\nLast year, the reality star visited the White House with prisoners she helped to free. Crystal Munoz, Judith Negron and Tynice Hall had their jail sentences cut short after Kardashian West lobbied US President Donald Trump.\nThe women had been jailed for drug-related and white collar crimes, and all had young children when imprisoned. Kardashian West is also campaigning for changes to the US justice system, particularly long sentences handed down to first-time offenders and the disproportionate effect on ethnic minority communities.\nIn Thursday's finale, her sister Khloe consoled her by saying: \"You had Covid, you had your 40th birthday. You had a lot personally in your relationship. And quarantine itself. I really don't think this time counted.\"\nKardashian West is in the process of divorcing rapper Kanye West. The couple married seven years ago and have four children.\nThe show's final episode saw her discussing her marital situation, telling her mother Kris she was now seeking \"total happiness\" and that she realised she was unhappily married after speaking to a therapist.\n\"Obviously, I know complete bliss is not a full reality but if I can have it more the majority of the time, that's all I want to do,\" she said.\n\"I just feel I've worked so hard in life to achieve everything that I wanted to and I lived up to my expectations and achieved 10 times more than I even thought was humanly possible, but I don't have a life to share that with.\"\nIn April, she joined the elite club of the super-rich by achieving billionaire status.

      "tags": "United Nations,Tigray crisis,Ethiopia",
      "text": "UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has said there is famine in northern Ethiopia after the release of a UN-backed analysis of the situation.\n\"There is famine now,\" he said, adding: \"This is going to get a lot worse.\"\nThe study found that 350,000 people were living in \"severe crisis\" in the war-torn Tigray region.\nTigray has been devastated by fighting between government forces and rebels, with 1.7 million people displaced since fighting began in November 2020.\nAccording to the assessment, the food situation in the region has reached the level of a \"catastrophe\", which it defines as starvation and death affecting small groups of people spread over large areas.\nThe UN's World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization and children's agency Unicef have all called for urgent action to address the crisis.\nThe analysis - or Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) as it is known - was not endorsed by Ethiopia's government, which has denied that there is a famine in the country.\nIt insists that humanitarian access is being expanded as it restores order across the region.\nPeople in Qafta Humera, an isolated district in the west of Tigray, told the BBC this week they were on the verge of starvation.\n\"We don't have anything to eat,\" one man said by phone, explaining their crops and livestock had been looted during seven months of war.\nThey were being prevented from seeking aid by a militia fighting with government forces, he added.\n\"We were eating small remains of crops that we managed to hide, but now we don't have anything,\" said a farmer in his 40s.\n\"Nobody has given us any aid. Almost everyone is on the verge of death - our eyes are affected by the hunger, the situation is perilous. Death is knocking on our door. You can see the hunger on the face of each of us.\"\nResidents said they had seen vehicles carrying aid pass by, but no-one had bothered to inquire about their predicament.\nIn 1984, Tigray and the next-door province of Wollo were the epicentre of a famine caused by a combination of drought and war that led to between 600,000 and one million deaths.\nThe Integrated Phase Classification is a measure of the severity of food shortages, drawn up by multiple organisations which include UN agencies and non-governmental aid organisations. \n\"An IPC analysis update conducted in Tigray and the neighbouring zones of Amhara and Afar concludes that over 350,000 people are in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) between May and June 2021,\" the report says.\n\"This severe crisis results from the cascading effects of conflict, including population displacements, movement restrictions, limited humanitarian access, loss of harvest and livelihood assets, and dysfunctional or non-existent markets,\" the analysis adds. \nIt says that as of May, 5.5 million people were facing high levels of acute food insecurity in the region and the situation was likely to worsen through to September.\nBut the report stops short of officially declaring a famine, which has a very specific definition. \nThe IPC announcement falls short of declaring a famine in Tigray. That is because the \"f-word\" is such a powerful, compelling word that governments and international organisations have agreed it should only be used when certain strict criteria are met. \nFor now, the IPC has settled on the use of the word \"catastrophe\" instead - with a warning that large parts of Tigray are at risk of famine in the coming months. \nPut simply, a \"Phase 5 catastrophe\" can refer to small groups of people, spread over large areas, whereas the word \"famine\" is only used when a big and distinct population group is experiencing conditions of starvation and death. And right now, in Tigray - in part because of insecurity and problems accessing those in most need - there is not yet the data to support a definition of famine.\nBut many experts find this - often highly politicised - debate over definitions both petty and counter-productive, and individuals, like the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, have chosen to ignore the rules and insist that \"there is famine now in Tigray\". \nLast November Ethiopia's government launched an offensive to oust the region's then ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).\nThe party had had a massive fallout with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed over political changes to the country's ethnically based federal system - though the TPLF's capture of federal military bases in Tigray was the catalyst for the invasion.\nMr Abiy, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, declared that the conflict was over at the end of November, but fighting has continued.\nThousands of people have been killed. Tens of thousands have sought refuge in neighbouring Sudan.\nAll sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses.\nFood shortages can lead to large numbers of people lacking nutrition, but only rarely do they amount to famine, according to UN humanitarian criteria.\nLong periods of drought and other problems reducing the supply of food do not necessarily result in a famine.\nA famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. They are:\nThe declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or member states, but serves to focus global attention on the problem.\nSource: UN"

      "title": "Covid: Is there a limit to how much worse variants can get?",
      "text": "It is clear we are now dealing with a virus that spreads far more easily - probably more than twice as easily - as the version that emerged in Wuhan at the end of 2019.\nThe Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, UK, performed a large jump in its ability to transmit. Now Delta, seen first in India, leapt further still. \nThis is evolution in action. \nSo are we doomed to a never-ending parade of new and improved variants that get harder and harder to contain? Or is there a limit to how much worse coronavirus can become?\nIt's worth remembering the journey this virus is on. It has made the jump from infecting a completely different species - its closest relatives are in bats - to us. It's like you, starting a new job: you're competent, but not the finished article. The first variant was good enough to start a devastating pandemic, but now it's learning on the job. \nWhen viruses jump to humans it would be \"very rare for them to be perfect,\" said Prof Wendy Barclay, a virologist from Imperial College London. \"They settle in and then they have a great time.\"\nThere are examples of viruses, she said, from flu pandemics to Ebola outbreaks, making the jump and then accelerating.\nSo how far could it go?\nThe cleanest way of comparing the pure biological spreading power of viruses is to look at their R0 (pronounced R-naught). It's the average number of people each infected person passes a virus on to if nobody were immune and nobody took extra precautions to avoid getting infected. \nThat number was around 2.5 when the pandemic started in Wuhan and could be as high as 8.0 for the Delta variant, according to disease modellers at Imperial.\n\"This virus has surprised us a lot. It is beyond anything we feared,\" said Dr Aris Katzourakis, who studies viral evolution at the University of Oxford. \"The fact it has happened twice in 18 months, two lineages (Alpha and then Delta) each 50% more transmissible is a phenomenal amount of change.\"\nIt's \"foolish\", he thinks, to attempt to put a number on how high it could go, but he can easily see further jumps in transmission over the next couple of years. Other viruses have far higher R0s and the record holder, measles, can cause explosive outbreaks. \n\"There is still space for it to move higher,\" said Prof Barclay. \"Measles is between 14 and 30 depending on who you ask, I don't know how it's going to play out.\"\nSo, how are the variants doing it?\nThere are many tricks the virus could employ to get better at spreading, such as:\nOne way the Alpha variant became more transmissible was by getting better at sneaking past the intruder alarm - called the interferon response - inside our body's cells. But this does not mean that by the time we work through the Greek alphabet of variants and reach Omega that we'll end up with an unstoppable beast. \n\"Ultimately there are limits and there isn't a super-ultimate virus that has every bad combination of mutations,\" said Dr Katzourakis.\nThere is also the concept of evolutionary trade-offs - in order to become better at one thing you often get worse at something else. The fastest vaccination programme in history will give the virus a different hurdle to overcome and squeeze it in another evolutionary direction. \n\"It is quite possible that changes in the virus that make it better at avoiding vaccines could end up compromising its ability to transmit in an absolute sense,\" said Dr Katzourakis.\nHe thinks the Beta variant - which has a mutation called E484K that helps evade the immune system but hasn't managed to take off - is an example of this. However, the Delta does have mutations that both help it spread and partially dodge immunity. \nWhat will turn out to be the optimal strategy for coronavirus is still hard to predict. Different viruses use different techniques to keep on infecting. Measles is explosive, but leaves behind lifelong immunity so it always has to find someone new. Influenza has a much lower R0, barely above 1, but constantly mutates to side-step immunity. \n\"We're in a really interesting, intermediate and somewhat unpredictable phase, it is difficult to predict how that's going to play out a year from now,\" said Prof Barclay.\nOne thing that is often claimed, but attracts scientific scorn, is that the virus must get milder in order to spread more easily. There is very little evolutionary pressure on the virus for that to happen. The virus is already off into the next person long before it kills the person it infected. And the people who do the most spreading (younger people) are those who don't get very ill. \nIn rich countries with good vaccination campaigns it is hoped the next variants won't be able to pose a major problem due to widespread immunity. But these progressively more transmissible variants are a nightmare for the rest of the world where they are making it harder and harder to stay on top of Covid.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lifting the last Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be delayed to \"stop us going backwards\", public health officials have said.\nUnlocking then would risk an increase in hospital admissions, the Association of Directors of Public Health said.\nThe government is expected to announce on Monday whether it will remove the last of the restrictions a week later.\nMinister Nadhim Zahawi said it had to be careful not to squander the progress made in tackling the virus.\nThe final stage of lifting restrictions would see all legal limits on social contact removed. Nightclubs would reopen, and restrictions on performances, weddings and other life events would also be lifted.\nBut concerns about the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, have led some scientists to call for a delay to ending lockdown.\nPublic Health England (PHE) estimates the variant is roughly 60% more spreadable than the previously dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, and could make people more seriously ill.\nThe latest official data suggests there have been nearly 30,000 new UK cases of the Delta variant in the past week, accounting for 90% of cases.\nPHE said nearly two thirds of people infected with the Delta variant have not had a vaccine at all.\nAnother 8,125 virus cases were recorded in the UK on Friday, according to official figures, and another 17 people died within 28 days of a positive test.\nAssociation of Directors of Public Health vice-president Jim McManus told Radio 4's Today programme the government had a \"fiendishly difficult decision\" to make on whether to ease restrictions further. \nHowever, he said if we \"invest that little bit of time to keep us going forwards, it will stop us going backwards\".\n\"If you get enough people infected, you will get a rise in hospitalisations,\" he said.\nHe added that more people getting infected would allow more variants to develop, which could risk a variant developing that evades the vaccine completely.\n\"So actually, investing a bit of time is really important to enable the vaccine programme to finish and do its job.\"\nAsked about reports in the Times that the government was considering a four-week delay, he said that would be \"really welcome\".\nLatest government figures show that more than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.4% of the adult population.\nAsked about the government decision on 14 June, Mr Zahawi, the vaccines minister, told BBC Breakfast: \"We have to be really careful so that those hard won wars against the virus are not squandered.\" \nHe reiterated that the government would \"share the data on Monday\".\n\"We all know the virus hasn't gone away, it will attempt to mutate,\" he said. \"The Delta variant is more infectious and more severe for those it infects. So, we have to be really careful.\"\nMeanwhile, the latest R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, up from between 1 and 1.2 last week, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others.\nIf the R number is above 1.0, the number of cases is increasing.\nMr Zahawi said that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June.\nHe also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global vaccination effort.\nThe UK has pledged to start donating vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks, as part of 100 million surplus doses which will be delivered in the next year."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly two-thirds of people infected with the Delta variant, and more than half of those who have died with it, have not had a Covid vaccine at all, the latest official data suggests.\nThere have been nearly 30,000 new UK cases of the variant in the past week.\nThe Public Health England report says it is likely to spread more easily and could make people more seriously ill.\nOfficials also say two doses of the vaccine provide \"significantly more protection\" than one.\nIt comes as the Office for National Statistics estimates coronavirus infections are continuing to rise in England, with one in 560 people testing positive.\nBut the ONS found no obvious increase in infections in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe Delta variant, which was first identified in India, is now the dominant variant in the UK - accounting for 90% of cases.\nIt is being closely monitored by PHE, which is using new genotyping tests to detect the variant more quickly as cases continue to rise.\nThese suggest that the Delta variant is roughly 60% more spreadable than the Alpha, or Kent, variant.\nAnalysis of hospital admission rates suggests people infected by the Delta variant are twice as likely to end up in hospital than those with Alpha.\nThe numbers are still small, however. \nOut of 33,000 cases analysed by PHE and confirmed to be the Delta variant since February, 223 have been admitted to hospital - most were unvaccinated or had only had only dose, and 20 people were fully vaccinated.\nAnd of 42 deaths in people with Delta variant infections, 23 were unvaccinated and seven had received only one dose. The other 12 had received two doses more than two weeks before.\nIn the UK, more than half of all adults have now been fully vaccinated with a Covid vaccine and more than three-quarters have had one dose. But that means more than 10 million adults, mostly in their 20s, have yet to have a single dose.\nAs more young people are vaccinated, protection against the new variant will rise.\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said \"vaccination is our best defence\". \n\"If you are eligible, we urge you to come forward and be vaccinated. Remember that two doses provide significantly more protection than a single dose.\"\nHowever, Dr Harries warned that while vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease, it does not eliminate it because Delta is \"significantly more transmissible than Alpha\".\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told the BBC the current wave of infections was increasing \"faster than we hoped\", but the vaccines \"do still work\".\n\"The more population immunity we've got, the smaller this wave will be,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, the latest R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, up from between 1 and 1.2 last week, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.\nIf the R number is above one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nThis is some of the last data we're going to see before the decision is made on whether to fully unlock in England on 21 June.\nSo what are these numbers really telling us?\nThey show both the incredible power of vaccines - and reasons for concern.\nMost cases, people needing hospital treatment and deaths were in those who haven't been vaccinated. \nHowever, it also shows the Delta variant is more transmissible and vaccines aren't a perfect defence. Some fully vaccinated people needed hospital treatment and died after catching the variant.\nPart of the variant's advantage over Alpha is its ability to partially evade the immune system in some vaccinated people. \nThe worry, from government science advisers, is a large summer wave of this more transmissible variant could still put the health service under pressure. \nThe ONS data, for the week to 5 June, found infection rates were highest in the North West of England at 0.5%, and across the rest of England they were either 0.1 or 0.2%.  \nAnd secondary schools had the highest infection rates (0.5%), followed by young adults (0.4%) - both groups which are yet to be vaccinated.\nThe lowest rates (0.1%) were in adults over 70 and those aged 50-69, the majority of whom are fully vaccinated, and therefore protected to some degree against infection."

      "tags": "Carrie Symonds,Boris Johnson,Angela Merkel,Justin Trudeau,Jill Biden,Emmanuel Macron,G7 summits",
      "text": "Carrie Johnson is hosting the spouses of world leaders at the G7 summit in Cornwall, in her first major public event since she married the UK prime minister in a secret ceremony last month. \nAt 33, she is the youngest of the partners, but not the only G7 rookie.\nThe other first-timers are US First Lady Jill Biden, Mariko Suga, the wife of Japan's prime minister, and Maria Serena Cappello, the wife of the Italian prime minister.\nMrs Johnson has already enjoyed a paddle in the sea with Mrs Biden.\nThere will be more formal glad-handing for the PM's wife to do while the leaders hold talks on issues including climate change, vaccine distribution and recovering from the pandemic.\nBut Mrs Johnson's biggest social duty will be to host a barbecue on Carbis Bay's beach on Saturday, at which VIP guests will tuck into scallops, Curgurrell crab claws and Portscatho mackerel, followed by sirloin and Newlyn lobster.  \nAfter that, they will be offered baked brie, hot buttered rum and toasted marshmallows around firepits on the sand, as they try to ward off the slight chill of a June evening in England.  \nSo who are the G7 spouses?\nFresh from her nuptials, Mrs Johnson has what might appear at first glance to be a daunting task - keeping the plus ones happy and entertained while their partners discuss the world's problems. \nA political tightrope to tread but one that Carrie Johnson should be well-suited for, with political nous honed over the years at Conservative Campaign Headquarters and more recently, in the world of conservation and political PR. \nAnd, in the coming days, seaside photo-ops in Poldark county with visits to the Cornwall beauty spots, St Ives and Penzance, are all possible.\nGiven Mrs Johnson's passion for the environment and conservation, Cornwall's 400 miles of coastline should offer the ideal background for her debut. \nAt 70, the US First Lady, who has spent decades working as a teacher, is Mrs Johnson's senior, but a fellow novice on the G7 stage.\nThe summit marks the first time the Bidens have been on an overseas trip together since he took office in January and this one will be crowned with a visit to the Queen at Windsor Castle on Sunday.\nDr Biden said she and her husband were looking forward to it, and that the couple hoped to focus on education in their discussions with the royals.\nIf the environment is Carrie Johnson's passion, then education is Jill Biden's.\nThe president has described her as America's \"favourite educator\", and the first lady herself has tweeted that teaching is \"not what I do\" but \"who I am\".\nAs well as a bachelor's degree, she has two master's degrees, and received a doctorate of education from the University of Delaware in 2007.\nAdvocating for military families and raising awareness about breast cancer prevention are other subjects close to her heart. \nFrance's leading lady has more experience than most of her counterparts of life at the top and she has made no secret of how difficult it can be.\nAfter her husband was elected in 2017, she said it was difficult to find peace and quiet on the job, telling French media \"what I do not like is that there is never [any] time off\" and \"wherever you are, there is always someone to take your picture\".\nThere is a 24-year age gap between Mrs Macron and her husband Emmanuel - she is 68 and he is 43.\nShe may find common ground with Jill Biden: Ms Macron was also a teacher - in fact, she taught her future husband drama when he was 15. \nMrs Macron is no stranger to headlines from meetings with foreign leaders, most notably after the former US President, Donald Trump, described her as being \"in such good shape\" on a visit to Paris in 2017. \nThe Canadian prime minister's wife will be hoping this trip is less eventful than her visit to London in March last year. \nShe hit the headlines for becoming one of the most high-profile figures to test positive for coronavirus after returning home and her husband has since stressed the importance of holding Covid-secure events. \nMrs Trudeau has spoken out publicly about her battle with bulimia from her late teens to her early 20s. \nLike Mrs Johnson, she worked in PR, before becoming an entertainment reporter on Quebec TV station LCN. \nMariko Suga is the wife of the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, and another G7 first-timer. \nMr Suga took power less than a year ago after Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, resigned for health reasons.\nMrs Suga has rarely spoken in public but has been described as a devoted supporter of her husband behind the scenes.\nJapanese media has portrayed her quiet demeanour as being in stark contrast to that of her predecessor, Akie Abe, who was viewed as a socialite, posting frequently on social media about meeting celebrities and other public figures.\nThe Italian prime minister's wife is another newbie on the G7 scene, despite being married to Mario Draghi for half a century.\nShe is often referred to in Italian media as \"the invisible wife\" because so little is known of her personality or political views. \nBut a profile for Italian Vanity Fair magazine earlier this year revealed a passion for both English literature and dogs - so pairing up with Jill Biden or discussing the behaviour of Dilyn, the Downing Street Jack Russell, should go down well. \nLast but not least is the outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel's husband, Joachim Sauer.\nThis is the couple's last major international summit together before Mrs Merkel leaves office later this year. \nAs the only male spouse, he will find himself in a similar position to Theresa May's husband Philip, who had the accolade of being the only husband at the G20 world leaders' meeting in Kyoto in 2019.\nA quantum chemist and professor of physical and theoretical chemistry, Mr Sauer never speaks to the media and rarely appears in public with his wife. \nHe skipped her inauguration in 2005, preferring to watch the event on TV at his Berlin university. \nA German newspaper once said he was as \"invisible as a molecule\"."

      "text": "A fifth soldier died at an Army base where four recruits were found dead between 1995 and 2002, it has emerged.\nPrivates Sean Benton, Cheryl James, Geoff Gray and James Collinson were all discovered with gunshot wounds at Deepcut Barracks, Surrey.\nIt can now be revealed another private, Anthony Bartlett, was found dead after a suspected overdose in July 2001.\nA former detective who investigated the later deaths at Deepcut said it was \"staggering\" he was not told about it.\nRetired Det Ch Insp Colin Sutton, who was the senior investigating officer for Surrey Police, said the death of Pte Bartlett had been hidden from him.\nThe Ministry of Defence told Newsnight the coroner had found Pte Bartlett's death was an accident and it strongly rejected any suggestion it had covered it up.\nBetween 1995 and 2002, four young recruits died of gunshot wounds at the Princess Royal Barracks, near the town of Deepcut, Surrey.  The Army insisted these were suicides, though the families disagreed.\nDCI Colin Sutton was asked to investigate two of the deaths - of Pte Geoff Gray who died of two gunshot wounds in September 2001 and Pte James Collinson who died in March 2002.\nHowever, he says he was not told that just two months before the death of Pte Gray there had been another death at the barracks, although Surrey Police had investigated it at the time.\nThe circumstances were different. Pte Bartlett, from Newton Stewart, Dumfries and Galloway, died from an overdose of Co-Proxamol - a strong painkiller that he had been prescribed by Army doctors for acute Achilles tendonitis, an injury he sustained during his five months at Deepcut.\nFormer DCI Sutton told Newsnight that Pte Bartlett's death had been \"kept hidden from me effectively\". \n\"Nobody told me about it,\" he said. \"If you're the senior investigating officer looking at the deaths of two soldiers at Deepcut and there's another death of a soldier that you're not told about, you know, it's just staggering to me. \n\"I just don't understand how that information can be kept from an investigation team that's looking at this at that barracks.\" \nThe fifth death is revealed in a new seven-part Audible podcast, Death at Deepcut, which delves into the circumstances surrounding what happened.\nIn the 19 years since the deaths at Deepcut made headlines, debate has raged over what led to four privates losing their lives in training in peacetime, all in similar circumstances.  \nThere was a review in 2006 led by Sir Nicholas Blake QC.  It criticised Army training, citing \"harassment, discrimination and oppressive behaviour\", but concluded that the deaths were probably self-inflicted. \nThere was no mention in Sir Nicholas's review of the death of Pte Bartlett. \nMost recently, fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Gray and James recorded suicide verdicts. The second hearing into Pte Benton's death confirmed the original inquest's conclusion that he had taken his own life.\nThe first inquest into the death of James Collinson ended in an open verdict. His parents dropped their bid for a new inquest in 2019 saying they did not have the strength to see it through.\nJames Collinson's mother, Yvonne, said she was \"flabbergasted\" that after years of battling for information about what happened to her son she is discovering there was another, up-to-now unpublicised death, just eight months before.\n\"All these years of experience with the Army and the police, they don't offer any truths and try and hide things from you that they think might cause them a bit of trouble,\" she told Newsnight.\n\"I also feel for the family of this young man. I suspect they didn't get very much support from the Army because I know we certainly didn't.  Only we understand how it feels. My condolences to them.\"\nThe Ministry of Defence strongly rejected claims it tried to hide a fifth death, saying Pte Bartlett's case was investigated by the police and ruled to be an accidental death by the coroner.  \nIn a statement the MoD said its \"thoughts remain with Pte Bartlett's family and all those affected by this tragic accident\".  \nIt adds that the deaths of the other four recruits were a \"tragedy\" and it sends its condolences to the families.\nThe statement continues: \"The armed forces take the responsibility for the welfare of service personnel very seriously. \n\"The Deepcut review of 2006 by Nicholas Blake QC made a number of recommendations, the majority of which were fully accepted. \n\"We will continue to support the health and wellbeing of all personnel throughout their time in the military and beyond.\"\nIn a statement, Surrey Police said the deaths of Sean Benton, Cheryl James, Geoff Gray and James Collinson were \"a tragic loss of life\". \n\"Surrey Police has previously accepted that mistakes were made during the initial stages of investigations into these deaths, including a failure to properly capture forensic evidence and to maintain primacy for the investigations. \n\"That these errors resulted in further suffering for the families remains a matter of deep regret,\" the force said. \nThe statement added that \"all the available evidence was examined\" at inquests into the four soldiers' deaths. \n\"The families of Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte Cheryl James have since sought new inquests... We hope that the conclusions of these new inquests provided their families with the clarification they had been seeking.\"\nThe statement concludes: \"Unless any new evidence comes to light, the investigations remain closed. If any further evidence is forthcoming, it will, of course, be thoroughly explored.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has sought to justify the timing of the first national Covid lockdown after claims a delay cost thousands of lives.\nHe told MPs locking down earlier than 23 March 2020 would have gone against the scientific advice at the time.\nMinisters did challenge the scientists, he insisted, but overruling their advice would have been \"much harder\".\nHe denied claims by Dominic Cummings at the same committee two weeks ago about his handling of the pandemic.\nHe rejected Mr Cummings's criticisms - including that he had lied to Prime Minister Boris Johnson about care home testing - and gave a very different version of events to that set out by the PM's former aide.\nAfter his appearance, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said Mr Hancock \"blames everyone but himself and the government for the handling of the pandemic\".\nMr Hancock told the MPs he \"bitterly regretted\" not pushing back harder against initial scientific advice that Covid was unlikely to spread asymptomatically. \nThis assumption was a big reason, he said, why the government advice on routinely testing hospital patients before they were discharged into care homes did not change until April.\nWhen pressed that government scientists had concluded on 28 January \"early indications\" implied asymptomatic transmission, he maintained the \"recommendation for policy advice\" at that point was that it was unlikely. \nHe said he had asked scientists in January to look into evidence from China that the virus could transmit in this way - but was told during a World Health Organization call this was \"highly likely\" to have been down to \"translation issues\".\nHe added he had an \"instinct\" the advice was wrong, but said it was hard to overturn this when \"you don't have the evidence that you're right, and the scientific consensus is wrong\".\nRegrets? Matt Hancock has a few. \nSuch as not challenging the assumption within Whitehall early last year that the public wouldn't tolerate a lockdown to contain Covid. \nHe \"bitterly regretted\" that he had not overruled scientific advice at the start of the pandemic that assumed coronavirus could not be transmitted asymptomatically. \nMr Hancock said the death rate in care homes \"weighed heavily\" on him. \nBut over four and half hours the health secretary defended the government's actions on several fronts - from PPE provision to care homes - making claims that will be scrutinised further. \nDominic Cummings sat in the same chair two weeks ago and heaped scorn on blame on his former colleagues (most venomously on Mr Hancock). \nIn contrast, the health secretary said ministers and officials largely did their best in unprecedented circumstances. \nMr Hancock strenuously avoided mentioning Mr Cummings by name but swatted away his allegations when they were put to him by MPs. \nWhile assiduously praising those he worked with Matt Hancock also gave the impression that what the crisis really needed was more Matt Hancock. \nAfter having his name trashed by Mr Cummings a fortnight ago this was quite a bounce back. \nMatt Hancock ended his evidence saying the government was now better prepared to handle another pandemic. \nIt had better be because Mr Hancock's testimony added to the picture of a government stunned, sometimes inert and often overwhelmed as the Covid crisis engulfed it at the start of last year.\nTwo weeks ago, Mr Cummings had told the committee that delays to lockdowns and mistakes by Mr Hancock and others had needlessly cost \"tens of thousands\" of lives. \nFormer government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson has said deaths in the UK would have been halved if the first lockdown had been introduced a week earlier.\nQuizzed by MPs on the decisions that led up to the first lockdown, the health secretary said he had instructed the NHS to plan on a \"reasonable worst case\" basis, from January, that 820,000 people could die from Covid.\nBut it was not until 9 March that data \"started to follow\" this trajectory, and not until a week later that \"updated modelling\" showed the UK was broadly on track to meet it.\nThe public was told to avoid non-essential social contact on 16 March, with a full UK-wide national lockdown introduced on 23 March. \nAsked why a lockdown was not implemented earlier, he said: \"The clear advice at the time was there was only a limited period that people would put up with lockdown.\"\nHe added: \"That proved to be wrong.\"\n\"Challenging the advice is one thing, but overruling a scientific consensus is much harder, especially when the costs of the lockdown of the lockdown are immediate and are obvious,\" Mr Hancock told the committee.\nMr Hancock also said he had known Mr Cummings wanted the PM to fire him last year, claiming the ex-aide had \"briefed the newspapers at the time.\"\nAnd in a swipe at the PM's former aide, he said government had \"operated better\" since his departure from Downing Street in December. \nDefending the government's initial advice that all hospital patients did not need to be repeatedly tested before being sent to care homes, he said ministers had \"followed the clinical advice\" at all times.\nHe said clinicians at the time were worried about people picking up Covid in hospital while they waited for test results and false negatives from patients without symptoms providing \"false assurance\". \nBut Labour's shadow care minister Liz Kendall accused Mr Hancock of \"selectively\" quoting clinical advice \"instead of admitting his abject failure to protect care homes\".\n\"He has now used multiple excuses for failing to test those discharged to care,\" she said. \nThe health secretary was giving evidence to the Commons health and science committees, as part of their joint inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.\nThe committees asked Mr Cummings to provide documents to back up his allegations about Mr Hancock. \nAsked by a reporter waiting outside his home when he would produce this material, Mr Cummings said: \"I'm dealing with a TV repair van, I'm afraid.\""

      "text": "An international group of scientists has called on Norway to halt plans for acoustic experiments on minke whales.\nThey say the process of capturing the animals and subjecting them to noise will be \"stressful and frightening\".\nThe project, the largest of its kind ever attempted, is due to begin any day now.\nThe Norwegian authorities say the aim is to get a better understanding of the levels of noise pollution that whales can hear.\nThe experiments will take place in the remote Lofoten Islands.\nThe goal is to use huge nets to drive 12 young minke whales into a holding pen - and local observers have confirmed that everything seems ready.\nAccording to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, the official body that's authorised the project, each whale will be held for up to six hours.\nThey will undergo blood tests and have electrodes fitted under their skin to measure their hearing.\n\"If necessary,\" the statement says, \"the whales will be sedated\".\nBut the authority says that based on the evidence of what happens when minke whales are caught in nets, it expects the animals to \"lie completely still\" until they are released.\nIt says, \"there is no question of exposing them to loud noise but of finding the lowest noise that they can actually hear\".\nBefore being freed, the whales will have satellite tags fitted to their dorsal fins so their behaviour after the experiments can be monitored.\nIt is officially acknowledged that the whales will experience pain, particularly while they are held between two rafts while their hearing is tested.\nThe Norwegian Food Safety Authority judges that the severity of the experiment will be \"moderate\" and it defines what that means: \"Animals are likely to experience short-term moderate pain, suffering or distress, or long-lasting mild pain, suffering or distress,\" it said.\nIt also said that \"moderately severe\" experiments of this kind \"are likely to cause moderate impairment of the well-being or general condition of the animals\".\nBut it concludes that by learning more about how noise pollution disturbs marine animals, the research will benefit minke whales and other species - so it should go ahead.\nIn a letter to the Norwegian prime minister, the 50 scientists who object to the plans dispute the assessment about \"moderate distress and discomfort\".\n\"We believe this is an understatement,\" they say.\n\"This process risks causing the whale considerable stress leading to panic, creating a dangerous situation for both whales and humans.\"\nThe scientists believe that it's not acceptable to expose young minke whales to the risks of sedation.\n\"Our concern is that the capture of juvenile minke whales, forcible restraint and experimentation upon them for a period of up to six hours, has significant potential for causing injury and stress, potentially resulting in long-term impacts\u2026\"\nAnd they are calling for the project to be cancelled because it may lead to \"considerable trauma for the whales targeted, without contributing to useful science\".\nOne of those who signed the letter is Sarah Dolman, policy manager at Whale and Dolphin Conservation.\nShe told me that while the threat of noise pollution is underestimated - and has been repeatedly linked to mass strandings of whales - it can't trump ethical and welfare concerns for the whales.\n\"They'll be herded into an unnatural environment, surrounded by human beings, and held in place.\n\"I think it will be incredibly stressful and incredibly frightening so we want it stopped - the situation is just too risky.\"\nMs Dolman points that out that similar research in Iceland was carried out on a pair of white-beaked dolphins but a female became so stressed that she had to be released.\n\"There's a history of welfare issues surrounding the capture and handling and whales and dolphins.\"\nThe experiments are being led by US scientists from the National Marine Mammal Foundation.\nThey did not respond to my request for comment.\nAccording to the US news organisation NPR, funding for the research is from organisations including the US Navy, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThat reflects how the military and the oil and gas industry want a better understanding of the effect of sonar, weapons and drilling on marine animals.\nBut as Sarah Dolman says: \"The fact that the noise producers are involved shows that they recognise that noise pollution is a concern.\n\"Are they doing as much we'd like to minimise the problem? Absolutely not.\"\nFollow David on Twitter."

      "text": "A request by the Manchester Arena bomber's elder brother to be given immunity in return for speaking to the attack inquiry has been denied.\nIsmail Abedi, 27, from Manchester, had refused to answer any of the inquiry's questions and claimed a general privilege against self-incrimination.\nAn immunity application was made to the inquiry's chairman Sir John Saunders.\nRefusing it, Sir John said any failure to prosecute may be seen as \"a considerable affront to justice\".\nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds were injured on 22 May 2017 when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert.\nThe bomber's younger brother Hashem Abedi, who was part of the conspiracy, was jailed in 2020 after being convicted of murdering all those who died.\nThe application by Ismail Abedi, who was arrested under the Terrorism Act the morning after the bombing but later released under investigation, had been opposed by lawyers representing bereaved families.\nHe has refused to answer the 40 questions posed to him in writing by the inquiry or agree to appear in person as a witness.\nSome witnesses in other public inquiries have received assurances that their evidence will not be used against them in a criminal prosecution.\nIn his ruling, Sir John said allowing immunity to get Mr Abedi to co-operate did not outweigh the potential effects on the administration of justice.\n\"If as a result of an undertaking from the Attorney General, the applicant was to disclose material to the inquiry which provided evidence to justify charges of murder or conspiracy to murder, then he could avoid trial for 22 murders and causing serious injury to many more,\" he said.\n\"While less serious, if he were to disclose material... which evidenced a failure by him to disclose information to the authorities which could have prevented the bombing happening, a failure to prosecute would be considered by many to be a considerable affront to justice.\"\nMr Abedi is expected to be served with a legal notice soon which will \"require\" his attendance in person at the inquiry and while he will be entitled not to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination, he will have to justify why and on what grounds he is refusing to answer.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Scotland's national clinical director has warned there must be a \"reverse gear\" if Glasgow's Euro 2020 fan zone leads to a surge in Covid cases.\nProf Jason Leitch said experts would closely monitor data linked to the event which opens at 15:00.\nHe also defended the decision to not to carry out temperature checks on Glasgow Green or make testing compulsory.\nOpposition politicians have criticised the plans given the tight rules in other sectors.\nOn Thursday talks between Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, clinical advisers, Glasgow City Council and other partners concluded without any changes to the management of the site.\nUp to 3,000 fans will be allowed at any one time, social-distancing will be enforced and alcohol can only be purchased via table service.\nThe first game to be shown live on the giant screens will be Friday's opening match between Italy and Turkey, which kicks off in Rome at 20:00.\nThe fan zone is scheduled to show every match during the tournament right through to the final at Wembley on 11 July.  \nBut speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Prof Leitch warned: \"If it goes badly there will have to be a reverse gear.\"\nAsked if the fan zone would be pulled if it resulted in clusters of cases, he said: \"Of course. And if we see behaviour that we don't think is appropriate.\"\nThe national clinical director said Police Scotland and stewards would closely monitor the site.\nProf Leitch added that a group including Scottish government and public health advisors would \"look at data all the time and make sure it is being done as safely as it possibly can.\"\nHe also told the programme temperature checks were \"very unreliable\" and recommended that people get tested before entering the fan zone, although it is not mandatory.\nFollowing Thursday's meeting, Mr Yousaf said every ticket holder would be asked, but not obliged, to use lateral flow testing kit.\nHe added: \"Planning has been meticulous to minimise the risks of transmission. The venue is outdoors with capacity for more than 25 times the number of tickets for each session, allowing for ample physical distancing.\n\"In addition, there are comprehensive stewarding, cleaning and contact tracing provisions in place and everyone attending will also be asked to take up the offer of twice weekly rapid lateral flow testing.\"\nHealth experts and hospitality leaders are among those who expressed concern about plans to let thousands of people watch the matches on large screens.\nThere has also been an outcry about an inconsistency in approach from some sectors in level two areas still facing restrictions - including soft play centres, hospitality, the cruise industry and school sports days.\nBut on several occasions Mr Yousaf has described the fan zone as a \"low-risk\" event.\nScotland's first major tournament in 23 years gets under way at Hampden against the Czech Republic on Monday.\nSteve Clarke's team then face England at Wembley on 18 June before returning to Hampden for the final group match against Croatia on 22 June.\nGlasgow is one of 11 host cities for the tournament and Scotland's opening game will be the first of four matches at the national stadium.\nBut due to the pandemic only 12,000 supporters - 25% of capacity - will be allowed to attend."

      "tags": "Companies,Clothing industry,Retailing,Asos,Boohoo",
      "text": "Nearly half of of women's clothes for sale on some of the leading online websites are made entirely from new plastics, according to a study.  \nThe research by the charity the Royal Society for the Arts (RSA) looked at 10,000 items being sold by  Boohoo, Prettylittlething, Missguided and Asos. \nIt found on average 49% were made of polyester, acrylic, nylon and elastane. \nThe RSA said the numbers varied by outlet with Asos using comparatively less new plastic than the others.\nThe study found that 60% of Boohoo's women's clothing and 57% of Boohoo-owned Prettylittlething's were made entirely from new plastics.\nMissguided had 42% of its items made entirely from new plastics and Asos 36%. \nThe RSA also said that the study found that on average, just 3% of clothes which contained any plastics used recycled plastics - \"although this rises to 6% among items from Asos\".\nMissguided's head of sourcing and product technology Paul Smith said the company was \"proud of the progress it had made\" and that all its own brand products were packaged and despatched in 100% recycled plastic. However, it added: \"We agree there's more to do.\"\nThe company said it had \"committed to making sure 10% of our products will use recycled fibres by the end of 2021 and 25% by the end of 2022\".\nAsos said the figures reflected positively on it, but like the rest of the industry it recognised more needed to be done.\nThe study for the report Fast Fashion's Plastic Problem, was carried out between 11 and 29 May. The researchers looked at more than 2,500 recently added items from each website, spread across different product categories.\nThe RSA said the plastic used large amounts of energy and created environmental damage in their production and could take thousands of years to break down.\nIt added that a \"throwaway culture\", meant that \"the bulk of these garments are ending up in landfill\".\n\"The sheer volume of clothing produced by these websites is shocking - we should see many of these items, which go for rock-bottom prices, as akin to other short-lived plastics. The nature of fast fashion trends means they are not designed to have long lives in our wardrobes,\" said the report's co-author Josie Warden.\nThe RSA is calling for action to cut down on the use of plastic in fashion items. \nIt wants to government to look at introducing a plastics tax on clothes imported into or produced in the UK.\nIt says websites should come  up with ways of promoting second-hand clothing, \"along the lines of Depop and Asos' marketplace\" and to publish figures on how much plastic they use.\nAnd it is encouraging consumers to buy less and keep clothes for longer, rather than only wearing garments a \"handful of times\". \nAsos, said its prices were not at \"throwaway\" levels and disputed the report's description of it as a fast-fashion retailer. \nIt pointed out it does publish information about fabrics and their care, including on a new page on its website about how to care for clothes in a more environmentally-friendly way.\nIt said it is encouraging that the RSA figures reflected positively on it because shifting to more sustainable materials was a key element of its Fashion With Integrity programme.\nHowever, it said like the rest of the industry it recognised there was much more work to do and that it was continually reviewing and developing programmes to minimise its impact on people and the planet.\nBoohoo has published its Up Front strategy which sets an \"ambitious\" goal of all polyester and cotton being recycled or more sustainable for 2025.\nHowever, the RSA report said the company had a \"mountain to climb\" to meet this target. \nBoohoo said: \"Solutions to these complex challenges require collaboration which is why we are delighted with the response from our existing and new suppliers to help us identify innovative solutions to achieve this target,\" a spokesperson said.\nBoohoo is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and a signatory of Textiles 2030.\n\"We've engaged with our customers extensively through focus groups and a recent survey, that received over 14,500 responses, to understand their attitudes to textile waste,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"What they tell us is that the price they pay does not determine how long they keep an item of clothing and 88% said that they use either charity shops or resale sites as a responsible form of disposal, throwing an item away is an absolute last resort for them.\""

      "text": "Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian teenager in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday.\nMohammed Hamayel, 15, died in clashes as Palestinians protested against the building of an illegal Jewish settlement near the city of Nablus. \nThe Israeli army said there was a riot and soldiers' lives were in danger.  \nThe incident comes just weeks after an 11-day conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza. \nAt least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel.\nMohammed Hamayel was buried on Friday, just hours after his death. Six people were also wounded in the protests, the health ministry said.  \n\"The rioters burned tyres, hurled rocks and launched fireworks towards troops who were present at the scene, endangering their lives,\" said an Israeli military spokesperson quoted by Reuters news agency. \n\"The troops responded with riot dispersal means and fired toward the rioters.\"\nThe protest in Beita, near Nablus, where Mohammed Hamayel was killed takes place weekly. \nIt is a demonstration of opposition to an illegal outpost of Jewish settlers recently re-established at Evyatar. \nSince it was first established in 2013, Evyatar has been razed several times by Israeli troops.\nSettlers began the latest attempt to re-establish Evyatar last month, following the fatal shooting of a young Israeli man, Yehuda Guetta, at a nearby junction. There are now 47 families living on the site, according to the Times of Israel. \nLast Sunday, the Israeli military issued an order to all those living at Evyatar to vacate the site by Monday 14 June and banning further construction.\nIsrael's defence minister rejected a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to delay the evacuation. \nThe deadline for the settlers to leave expires the day after a new Israeli government is expected to be sworn in, bringing an end to Mr Netanyahu's time in office. \nIf the new coalition takes office, it will be headed by Naftali Bennett, a right wing nationalist who rejects the concept of a Palestinian state.  \nIsrael has occupied the territories since the 1967 Middle East war. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \nMost of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this."

      "tags": "Television,Acting,Muslims,The Oscars,Film,Riz Ahmed",
      "text": "British actor and rapper Riz Ahmed has launched a fund to help combat \"toxic portrayals\" of Muslims in films.\nThe move comes after a study showed Muslims rarely appear on screen, or are shown in a negative light if they do.\nEarlier this year, the Sound of Metal star became the first Muslim to be nominated for best actor at the Oscars.\nAhmed, who is also known for Rogue One and The Night Of, said: \"The problem with Muslim misrepresentation is one that can't be ignored any more.\"\nIn an online video, he said his history-making Oscar nomination was a \"bittersweet\" moment.\n\"I simultaneously wore that slightly dubious accolade with a sense of gratitude personally... I also felt tremendous sadness.\n\"How was it that out of 1.6 billion people - a quarter of the world's population - none of us had ever been in this position until now?\n\"I asked myself, if I'm the exception to the rule, what must the rule be about people like me? What must the unwritten rule be about Muslims - a quarter of the world's population - and their place in our stories, our culture and their place in our society, if any?\"\nThe 38-year-old Londoner added: \"But I'm here to briefly tell you that exceptions don't change the rules. Exceptions if anything highlight the rule and in some ways allow us to be complacent about leaving that rule in place.\n\"The progress that's being made by a few of us doesn't paint an overall picture of progress if most of the portrayals of Muslims on screen are still either non-existent or entrenched in those stereotypical toxic two-dimensional portrayals.\"\nHe said the new Blueprint for Muslim Inclusion would include funding and mentoring for up-and-coming Muslim storytellers.\nThe $25,000 (\u00a317,700) fellowships for young Muslim artists will be awarded by an advisory committee that will include such actors and comedians as Mahershala Ali, Ramy Youssef and Hasan Minhaj.\nThe study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, titled Missing and Maligned, found that fewer than 10% of top-grossing films released between 2017-2019 from the UK, US and Australia featured a speaking Muslim character.\nWhen they did, they were shown as outsiders, threatening or subservient, the study suggested. About one-third were perpetrators of violence and more than half were targets of violence.\nAhmed said many of the depictions were \"completely racist\". In a statement, the actor said: \"The representation of Muslims on screen feeds the policies that get enacted, the people that get killed, the countries that get invaded.\n\"The data doesn't lie. This study shows us the scale of the problem in popular film, and its cost is measured in lost potential and lost lives.\"\nAl-Baab Khan, one of the report's authors, said: \"Muslims live all over the world, but film audiences only see a narrow portrait of this community, rather than viewing Muslims as they are: business owners, friends and neighbours whose presence is part of modern life.\"\nAfter making his name playing a hapless Jihadi in the 2010 satire Four Lions, Ahmed recently said he enjoyed the fact that the religion and ethnicity of his character Ruben in Sound of Metal was not mentioned at all in the movie.\nHis other recent film Moghul Mowgli was a deeply personal take on, and celebration of, British-Asian culture.\nMeanwhile in his parallel career as a rapper, Ahmed tackled issues around Islamophobia in the UK in his 2020 album The Long Goodbye.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "DUP MP Ian Paisley has defended joining Sir Van Morrison in chanting that Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann \"is very dangerous\" at a cancelled concert in Belfast.\nIt came after four gigs by Sir Van at the Europa Hotel were cancelled at the last moment on Thursday.\nSir Van has been an outspoken critic of Covid-19 restrictions.\nMr Paisley said: \"What was parody, comedy, banter and sarcasm should not be blown out of all proportion.\"\nSir Van took to the stage and addressed about 140 people who were at the dinner event after the gig was cancelled.\nThe singer referred to previous comments made by Mr Swann in Rolling Stone magazine, in which he described the singer as dangerous.\n\"Last night's event was very sad for the live music industry. I was put on the spot and called to the stage,\" the North Antrim MP said in a statement.\n\"I certainly don't believe Robin is dangerous. I think the parody and sarcasm of that comment is obvious.\n\"There is a balance in all of these matters and at times we get them right and at times wrong. We are all entitled to our own views on how the lockdown has been managed.\"\nMr Swann is a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the chanting against him drew an angry response from UUP leader Doug Beattie.\n\"Having watched the video of Ian Paisley and Van Morrison`s antics on the stage of the Europa Hotel in Belfast, I am absolutely disgusted by what I saw,\" Mr Beattie said.\n\"They should be ashamed of themselves. Two grown men who should know better, engaging in a very personal attack on Northern Ireland`s health minister.\"\nThe UUP leader added that Mr Swann \"has worked tirelessly during the Covid-19 pandemic to save lives\" and said it was \"appalling\" to watch him being denigrated.\nWhen asked about Mr Paisley's attack on the health minister, the new DUP leader Edwin Poots said he couldn't comment as he hadn't seen the video.\nAuthor Kevin Toolis, who was at the dinner, described the events as \"quite strange\".\n\"I think the audience were a bit nervous, people didn't chant,\" he said.\nMr Toolis said that while Mr Swann may be many things, \"dangerous is not a word most people would associate with him\".\nIn video of the event, seen by BBC News NI, Sir Van can be seen inviting North Antrim MP Ian Paisley onto the stage, who then joined him in the chant: \"Robin Swann is very dangerous.\"\nMr Toolis, who was part of the audience, said: \"Just right at the end Ian Paisley Jr got on stage and they were sort of standing beside each other.\n\"It only lasted a few seconds but it was sort of the end of the evening, and then Van Morrison and everyone else left and then we got on with our dinner.\n\"It was all very quick and rushed and very confused, it seemed a bizarre, strange end to a really, really strange five minutes of your life.\"\nThe hotel group had hoped to have the concerts classed as test events, but had to call them off on the advice of the Executive Office.\nMr Paisley had been critical of the executive's decision making when speaking after news of the concert's cancellation emerged. \n\"That crowd at Stormont, who told Howard Hastings (managing director of Hastings Hotels) this was a yes, couldn't run a bath,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"Little bit of wonder there's disarray tonight.\"\nOn Friday, outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster said she was not surprised by Mr Paisley's comments as \"that particular individual\" has always been critical of the Northern Ireland Executive.\nJames McGinn, general manager of the Europa Hotel, said Thursday night's events adhered to Covid restrictions.\n\"Everything was risk-assessed within an inch of its life and we've always been Covid compliant and obviously the welfare of my staff and all of our patrons were always top of our priority,\" he said.\nLast year, Sir Van accused the government of \"taking our freedom\" in three new songs that protest against the coronavirus lockdown.\nMr Swann described the songs as dangerous and said if Sir Van had scientific facts he should present them."

      "text": "A convicted terrorist who was shot by police following the Fishmongers' Hall attack was lawfully killed, an inquest jury has found.\nUsman Khan fatally stabbed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones during a prisoner rehabilitation conference at the London venue on 29 November 2019.\nHe was chased from the hall on to London Bridge by three men, before being shot at 20 times by armed police.\nThe inquest heard police feared Khan might detonate a suicide belt.\nSix police officers from the Met and City of London fired 20 times at Khan, including 18 shots in a 90-second period. \nThey had been sanctioned to carry out a so-called \"critical shot\" amid fears he was about to detonate his device. It turned out to be a fake.\nTwelve of the 20 bullets hit Khan. A forensic pathologist gave the cause of death as haemorrhage due to multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen.\nThe post-mortem examination also showed several other injuries, including from a narwhal tusk taken from the wall of Fishmongers' Hall by those who tried to thwart Khan. \nOne tusk jab had nearly killed him, passing within a centimetre of the carotid artery and jugular vein, the inquest heard.\nThe first team of firearms officers from the City of London Police had arrived seconds after Khan was pursued out of Fishmongers' Hall to find a m\u00eal\u00e9e on London Bridge. As they tried to take control of Khan, he said to one of them: \"I've got a bomb.\"\nThe officer - named only as YX99 in the inquest to protect his identity - then realised Khan had some sort of belt with wires around his waist. As soon as he could do so safely, he opened fire twice.\n\"Literally the first second the shot became available, I took it,\" YX99 told the inquest, \"to save myself and to try and save the people around me.\"\nJurors at London's Guildhall concluded that Khan had been lawfully killed by anonymous police officers.\nThey were directed to return a short-form conclusion of lawful killing by coroner Mark Lucraft QC on the grounds that each of the officers who shot Khan believed it was necessary to do so to protect themselves and others.\nIn a longer, narrative conclusion, the jury said that when the police shot Khan dead, the officers \"believed he was trying to find a trigger\" on a suicide vest, and that when they opened fire, they feared Khan was moving to detonate the device.\nThe coroner Mark Lucraft QC praised the work of Ms Jones and Mr Merritt, whose lives were \"tragically cut short\" by Khan. The standard of first aid performed on the day could not be faulted, he added. \nHe further praised the efforts of the three people who showed \"great bravery\" in chasing Khan out of Fishmongers' Hall.\nKhan had been released 11 months before the killings despite being viewed as an \"influential\" inmate who mixed with high-profile terrorists.\nA Court of Appeal ruling meant Khan, from Stafford, had to be automatically released on licence from prison, with the Parole Board having no say as to whether he was safe to be freed.\nUpon his release, Khan was assessed as being more dangerous than when he went into prison, and there was seen to be an imminent risk of him causing serious harm to the public.\nMet Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said he would await the coroner's Prevention of Future Deaths report and praised the \"heroic\" speed and professionalism of his officers.\n\"But my final words are reserved for Jack and Saskia,\" he said. \"They were two wonderful and talented young people who already achieved so much in their lives, which were tragically cut short.\n\"My thoughts and the thoughts of everyone in policing are with the friends, families and loved ones of Jack and Saskia, and they are with everyone who was injured, traumatised or affected by this attack.\""

      "text": "The prime minister is known for his optimism. It irritates some people, but inspires others. \nBut on Thursday he came practically bouncing out of his bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden, ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall. \nThe meeting was personal as well as political for both men, and their partners. \nAt their first encounter at Carbis Bay, the 78-year-old American made a beeline to greet the new Mrs Johnson, joking, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute!' to Boris Johnson before their introductions. \nThe quartet strolled obediently, admiring the view for the cameras before jokes were cracked as the men sat down. \nThe First Lady then took a barefoot walk on the beach with Carrie Johnson and her young son. \nWhat politicos would call the \"optics\", splashed on most front pages, could hardly have been much better even though the Cornish mizzle put paid to the original plan of the meeting taking place on the spectacular St Michael's Mount. \nIt's what happened in the meeting proper which matters most, though. \nAnd after more than an hour of talks, the prime minister was plainly pleased. \nHe was at pains to point out that the president had not ticked him off over the stand-off between the UK and the EU over Northern Ireland, even though in the run-up to the summit the United States had made its displeasure and concern about what's going on crystal clear. \nHe said he and Mr Biden had discussed more than 20 topics in \"terrific\" talks.\nCooperation on vaccines, a UK promise to send a 100 million doses to developing countries within the next 12 months alongside America's commitment to 500 million, the economy, and their common promises on climate change were among the subjects covered. \nAnd Mr Johnson gave a hint that President Biden was keen to find ways to help find justice for the family of British teenager Harry Dunn, evoking the president's own personal history.  \nAs with so many issues, the UK and the US both want progress - but agreeing on how to make that happen is a different question. \nAfter letting it be known that he was uneasy about the clich\u00e9d term \"special relationship\", the prime minister even coined a new phrase, the \"indestructible relationship\", or the \"deep and meaningful\" one.\nThe two leaders' first real-life introduction clearly went well. \nBoris Johnson and his team believe chemistry between leaders matters, and that the simple fact of gathering in person sends an important message too. \nThe prime minister won't escape political pressure this week on whether his big promises stand up to reality.\nHe has infuriated the EU by, as they see it, not sticking to a deal he signed only last year. \nMeetings with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and the EU Commission boss won't be easy. \nMr Johnson's made a huge pledge on vaccines, but only five million doses will go to developing countries soon, and unlike some other G7 countries, the UK won't waive intellectual property rights on jabs. \nAnd for all his talk about wanting to help poorer parts of the world, to the rage of some of his own MPs, he's cutting the amount of aid the UK spends. \nThe issues the prime minister wants to confront this week can't be solved by just bonhomie at the beach."

I've just bought a brand new 65-inch television to watch the matches.\"\nWhile most people will watch the games at home or in the pub, Covid rules on who you can have round, and what you can do in your local remain in place, with people warned not to sing, chant and to remain social distanced while watching the games.\nSteve Ward from Rhondda has hardly missed a Wales match since 1997, but he decided against travelling across Europe this year due to the restrictions.\nHe has transformed his garage into a bar with lots of football memorabilia and has painted a Welsh football mural on the inside of the garage door.\n\"Me and my mates are gutted not to be going,\" he said. \"We were having a last-minute look for flights to Azerbaijan this week again but, no, I can't do it because of the quarantine when we get back.\"\n\"We're going to have friends here at home to watch the match in the garage on Saturday. We'll be in Aberdyfi to watch the Turkey game because we're going on a mini-trip around Wales during the week. Then back here for the Italy match.\"\nWelsh football magazine show FC Cymru will also be broadcasting live from Steve's house during the Italy match.\nTo further boost Wales' hopes during the tournament, a new supporters group in south Wales called Amar Cymru has also been created for the South Asian community.\nOne of the group's founders, Jalal Goni, said: \"Historically South Asians have been to cricket but that's not the case in south Wales. \n\"The number one sport is football. With the Euros starting now, and Wales' message of Together Stronger, we want to be a part of that.\n\"The definition of Amar is 'my'. It's used in the South Asian community to mean 'mine', and Cymru, as we all know, is the best place in the world, so 'Amar Cymru' means 'My Wales'.\"\nAnother member of the group, Babru Miah, said: \"To get to two European tournaments back-to-back is amazing. \n\"It doesn't matter too much how we do. We're there and that's the main thing. I'm going to enjoy it either way.\"\nRead more about Covid restrictions in Wales\nAnwen Charles and her husband Rhodri followed Wales around France in 2016. Their then six-month-old son Osian experienced the tournament too and made it on to Match of the Day's highlights.\nFour years on and the family will be watching from home, having decided not to travel.\nShe said: \"We were going to Baku and then to Rome, but we decided to cancel the flights with a heavy heart. It was too much of a risk. \n\"Maybe there'll be scope to go to a match if we make the knock-out rounds - fingers crossed.\n\"We're away camping this weekend, so we'll watch the Switzerland game in the pub, but we have a projector and screen ready for the garden to watch the Turkey and Italy matches,\" she said.\nBrad Evans is part of a group of supporters from Llandudno Junction who had hoped to follow their heroes in Europe again this summer but the group of 12 decided in February not to go.\nInstead, they will be watching the matches at their local pub. Their Llandudno Junction Wales flag, which has not missed a Wales away trip in 10 years, will be staying at home too.\nHe said: \"We had a week in Baku planned originally and then we would fly to Milan and get a train to Rome. We're gutted not to be going.\n\"We've had the majority of flights refunded or had vouchers.\n\"I reckon we need one win and a draw and that should be enough to get out of the group. \n\"If we can pick up points in the first two games that should be okay. Italy away is the toughest.\""

      "text": "Wildlife officials in India have helped reunite a leopard cub that was separated from her mother.\nVillagers in the north-eastern state of Assam found the two-month old female stuck in a trench in a tea garden.\nWildlife vet Khanin Changmai, who was called to attend to the cub, told the BBC that he found her \"playful and uninjured, but slightly dehydrated\".\nIndia has more than 12,500 leopards. With their habitat shrinking, the cats often stray into villages near forests.\nReports of man-animal conflict have been growing in recent years across the country as leopards come into the villages and kill livestock. They have also sometimes entered crowded areas and attacked people.\nThe latest incident, which took place in Natun Gaon village in Tinsukia district on the morning of 23 May, has been reported only recently by wildlife officials.\n\"There was panic in the nearby villages when tea pluckers spotted the leopard in the tea garden. She fled when they raised an alarm,\" Dr Changmai, a vet with the Wildlife Trust of India, told the BBC's Geeta Pandey.\nHe said the plantation owner was led to the trench by the cub's crying. Since she was unable to come up on her own, the villagers rescued her and took her to a nearby house.\nDr Changmai said he gave her \"15-20ml of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to treat her dehydration\".\nThe village is close to two small sanctuaries and is separated by a river from the Dibru-Soikhowa National Park, home to tigers, leopards and other wild animals. \nDr Changmai said the villagers were worried that the leopard would return to find the cub and insisted that we take her away and also set a trap to catch the mother, \"but we convinced them that they must not interfere and leave the cub where they'd found her\".\nThe cub was returned to the area \"in a cardboard box, lightly sealed with tape to ensure it couldn't get out on its own but the mother would be able to tear it open\".\n\"We checked on her again in the evening and gave her some more ORS. We set up camera traps to monitor the area. The villagers also kept an eye to ensure it wasn't attacked by dogs,\" Dr Changmai said.\n\"At night, less than 12 hours after they were separated, the mother found the box and retrieved her cub,\" he added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly two-thirds of people infected with the Delta variant, and more than half of those who have died with it, have not had a Covid vaccine at all, the latest official data suggests.\nThere have been nearly 30,000 new UK cases of the variant in the past week.\nThe Public Health England report says it is likely to spread more easily and could make people more seriously ill.\nOfficials also say two doses of the vaccine provide \"significantly more protection\" than one.\nIt comes as the Office for National Statistics estimates coronavirus infections are continuing to rise in England, with one in 560 people testing positive.\nBut the ONS found no obvious increase in infections in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe Delta variant, which was first identified in India, is now the dominant variant in the UK - accounting for 90% of cases.\nIt is being closely monitored by PHE, which is using new genotyping tests to detect the variant more quickly as cases continue to rise.\nThese suggest that the Delta variant is roughly 60% more spreadable than the Alpha, or Kent, variant.\nAnalysis of hospital admission rates suggests people infected by the Delta variant are twice as likely to end up in hospital than those with Alpha.\nThe numbers are still small, however. \nOut of 33,000 cases analysed by PHE and confirmed to be the Delta variant since February, 223 have been admitted to hospital - most were unvaccinated or had only had only dose, and 20 people were fully vaccinated.\nAnd of 42 deaths in people with Delta variant infections, 23 were unvaccinated and seven had received only one dose. The other 12 had received two doses more than two weeks before.\nIn the UK, more than half of all adults have now been fully vaccinated with a Covid vaccine and more than three-quarters have had one dose. But that means more than 10 million adults, mostly in their 20s, have yet to have a single dose.\nAs more young people are vaccinated, protection against the new variant will rise.\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said \"vaccination is our best defence\". \n\"If you are eligible, we urge you to come forward and be vaccinated. Remember that two doses provide significantly more protection than a single dose.\"\nHowever, Dr Harries warned that while vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease, it does not eliminate it because Delta is \"significantly more transmissible than Alpha\".\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told the BBC the current wave of infections was increasing \"faster than we hoped\", but the vaccines \"do still work\".\n\"The more population immunity we've got, the smaller this wave will be,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, the latest R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, up from between 1 and 1.2 last week, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.\nIf the R number is above one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nThis is some of the last data we're going to see before the decision is made on whether to fully unlock in England on 21 June.\nSo what are these numbers really telling us?\nThey show both the incredible power of vaccines - and reasons for concern.\nMost cases, people needing hospital treatment and deaths were in those who haven't been vaccinated. \nHowever, it also shows the Delta variant is more transmissible and vaccines aren't a perfect defence. Some fully vaccinated people needed hospital treatment and died after catching the variant.\nPart of the variant's advantage over Alpha is its ability to partially evade the immune system in some vaccinated people. \nThe worry, from government science advisers, is a large summer wave of this more transmissible variant could still put the health service under pressure. \nThe ONS data, for the week to 5 June, found infection rates were highest in the North West of England at 0.5%, and across the rest of England they were either 0.1 or 0.2%.  \nAnd secondary schools had the highest infection rates (0.5%), followed by young adults (0.4%) - both groups which are yet to be vaccinated.\nThe lowest rates (0.1%) were in adults over 70 and those aged 50-69, the majority of whom are fully vaccinated, and therefore protected to some degree against infection."

      "text": "Opposition MPs have called on the home secretary to resign after documents suggested she misled Parliament over her decision to house asylum seekers at Kent's controversial Napier Barracks.\nHealth officials, inspectors and a High Court judge have examined concerns dormitory use led to a Covid outbreak. \nPriti Patel said in February that \"use of the accommodation was all based on Public Health England (PHE) advice\". \nHowever, a Home Office email said PHE advice viewed dorms as unsuitable.\nAmid calls in the Commons for Ms Patel to resign, SNP MP Joanna Cherry said: \"What she said - that the department had previously followed public health guidance regarding Napier Barracks in every single way - was simply not factually correct.\"\nShe asked: \"Why isn't the home secretary tendering her resignation as Amber Rudd (the former home secretary) had the grace and decency to do?\"\nHome Office minister Chris Philp said the department followed PHE guidelines \"where possible\".\nA Home Office email from last September said: \"Public health advice is just that - we don't have to follow it, but should we choose not to and then have an outbreak of Covid, the fallout would be significant.\"\nIt said: \"Their advice is that dormitories are not suitable.\"\nDocuments published by the Home Affairs Committee showed how the Home Office detailed specifications in September and said \"dormitories which can be adapted to be Covid-19 compliant are acceptable\".\nHowever, a note from a PHE official at the time said: \"I don't know how dormitories can be Covid-compliant.\"\nThree months later, further PHE guidance sent to the Home Office said: \"All guests (asylum seekers in Home Office accommodation) should be treated as potentially infectious. They should have individual rooms with en-suite to avoid need to leave the room.\"\nBut in February, Ms Patel told MPs that PHE and local authorities gave guidance which her department had been following \"in every single way\".\nFollowing questions from the BBC, the Home Office provided further background information on why the home secretary told MPs she was following PHE guidance \"in every single way\" when using dormitories at Napier Barracks.\n\"While the advice to officials from PHE was that dormitory style accommodation was not suitable,\" a spokesman confirms, \"it also set out how congregate residential settings should be used if other accommodation is not available\".\n\"We believed we were taking reasonable steps to give effect to the PHE advice as to the steps that should be taken to make dormitory accommodation as safe as possible.\"  \nThe Home Office also states that throughout the setup and operation of the site, it has engaged with health officials to ensure it is fully aware of the most thorough and up-to-date advice and continues to make improvements to ensure the safety of those in asylum accommodation.\nIn the High Court in April, a witness statement by a senior Home Office official said: \"Health agencies continue to have serious reservations about use of the site.\"\nIn the statement, Philomena Creffield quoted an unnamed health official and said \"she/he has not been provided with evidence that Napier now provides a Covid-safe environment\".\nThe official was said to have warned the Home Office \"that the accommodation and configuration of Napier is not in line with the guidance and that another outbreak is inevitable\".\nMs Creffield's statement accepted \"congregate or communal settings give rise to an increased risk of transmission of Covid-19\" but said, rather than close the accommodation, the Home Office was \"working towards taking steps to improve our processes in terms of identifying and managing any outbreak\".\nHundreds of men were housed at the disused barracks, as the Home Office faced an urgent need to accommodate asylum seekers arriving in boats across the Channel.\nAs the pandemic raged, up to 20 asylum seekers slept in dormitories with sheets separating beds.  \nIn January, nearly 200 men caught Covid-19 in an outbreak at the site.\nLast week, the High Court ruled the decision to house asylum seekers at Napier was unlawful, however the Home Office said the site would continue to operate.\nMany residents were moved out in April, but lawyers said the number of residents has since gone back up to more than 265, with men sleeping in dormitories of up to 12."

      "tags": "Learning disability,NHS",
      "text": "People with learning disabilities are still dying 25 years earlier than the rest of the population, a report has said.\nThe Learning Disabilities Mortality Review (LeDeR) calls for urgent action to prevent more avoidable deaths.\nA quarter of learning disability deaths were caused by Covid in 2020, compared to 13% of other deaths.\nNHS England said improving the health of people with a learning disability was a priority.\nThe LeDeR was established in 2015 to try to understand why so many people with learning disabilities were dying from avoidable causes, and to try and improve their access to healthcare.\nThe latest report compares data from the deaths of 9,110 people with learning disabilities who died over the past three years.\nIt found that while there had been some small improvements - life expectancy had increased by one year - people were still experiencing huge inequalities.\nIn 2020, 24% of learning disability deaths were caused by Covid-19 compared to just 13% of deaths in the general population.\nThe peak month for deaths from Covid-19 was April 2020, when 59% of all deaths were from the virus. \nIt was the leading cause of death in men over 35 and women over 20 with learning disabilities throughout the past year.\nReviewers found that poor testing provision, a lack of support from specialist services and difficulties using the NHS 111 service played a part in many of the deaths.\nIn nearly a third of 'do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation' (DNACPR) orders made in relation to people who had died from Covid-19, the correct procedure was not properly followed.\nIn some cases, the reason given for a 'do not resuscitate' order was because the person had a learning disability. \nOne example cited in the report was because the person was \"wheelchair-bound, needs to be hoisted, care home resident, learning disability.\"\nThey also found many examples of poor care - in 42% of the deaths in 2020, reviewers felt that the person's care had not met good practice standards.\nSteven Baskin's family feared that he could have become one of those statistics. The 43-year-old, who has Down's Syndrome, was treated in hospital for Covid-19 at the beginning of the outbreak, in March 2020.\nHis father, John, was told that his son would not be given access to a ventilator should he need one, because of his \"underlying health conditions\".\nHe said: \"I received a call from a doctor who told me that a decision had been taken - should Steven require the use of a ventilator, then this would be denied. \n\"I was exercising in the park at the time of the call and had to find a bench to sit down - I was really taken aback.\"\nHe discussed Steven's condition with other senior doctors who intervened, and the decision not to give him a ventilator was reversed.\nHe said: \"Steven had undergone treatment which affected his immune system, but other than this, he was perfectly healthy, and his treatment was going well.\"\nSteven recovered from Covid-19, but his family felt they had had to fight to get him the access to healthcare they felt he needed.\nReport author Pauline Heslop, who is based at the University of Bristol, said: \"This year, for the first time, we have been able to compare data based on the year of a person's death. \n\"There are some small signs of progress being made, but this is not sufficient, nor sufficiently well distributed across people with learning disabilities from different ethnic groups.\n\"Actions taken to date, while welcome, have clearly not been enough to make the progress we should expect to see.\"\nClaire Murdoch, mental health director for NHS England, said: \"Every year, people with a learning disability die sooner than they should and many from potentially avoidable conditions, such as constipation or aspiration pneumonia.\n\"Despite the pandemic, the NHS has ensured that three-quarters of people over the age of 14 with a learning disability have received their annual health check, two years ahead of the Long Term Plan target,\" she said.\n\"It is vital we use this report to make real and lasting change to help close the health inequality gap seen throughout society.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson has urged fellow world leaders to \"build back better\" after the Covid pandemic at this week's G7 summit in Cornwall.\nThe UK prime minister said it was vital to learn from the \"mistakes\" of the 2008 financial crisis and tackle the \"scar\" of inequality.\nAfter a day of talks at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay, leaders have joined the Queen for a dinner nearby.\nThe distribution of Covid vaccines is also high on the summit agenda.\nEarlier, the leaders posed for a group photo with the Queen, where the monarch was heard to joke: \"Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?\"\nThe leaders around the Queen laughed, and Mr Johnson replied emphatically: \"Yes.\"\nThe prime minister added: \"We have been enjoying ourselves - in spite of appearances.\"\nUS President Joe Biden is among those being hosted by Mr Johnson for the three-day meeting, as well the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada.\nIt is the first face-to-face summit of the G7 - representing most of the world's biggest economies - since before the pandemic started early last year. \nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel are also attending.\nIn his opening remarks at the main round-table discussions, Mr Johnson said that, as the world recovered from the pandemic, it was important to \"level up across our societies\" and \"build back better\".\nHe added: \"I actually think that we have a huge opportunity to that because, as G7, we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world, a solution to the problems of climate change.\"\nThe prime minister also said it was \"vital that we don't repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis - the last great economic recession of 2008 - when the recovery was not uniform across all parts of society\".\nPoliticians are attending a Friday evening reception at the nearby Eden Project, attended by the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\nThe UK government announced it was giving \u00a3430m in aid to the Global Partnership for Education, to help the world's \"most vulnerable children\" get better schooling, with a \"particular\" focus on girls.\nIt was important for the world economy to rebuild in a \"more equal and... in a more gender-neutral and perhaps a more feminine way\" after the huge damage caused by coronavirus, Mr Johnson told his fellow leaders.\nAs camera crews and photographers left the meeting room at the Carbis Bay Hotel, he joked that what had been intended as a \"fireside chat\" had turned into a \"media circus\".\nTweeting a photograph of himself with some of the other European leaders sitting on a seaside terrace, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote: \"As always, the same union, the same determination to act, the same enthusiasm! The G7 can begin.\"\nAs G7 leaders got round the table and down to business Boris Johnson's opening remarks initially followed a familiar pattern as he talked about \"building back better\". \nBut he ended on a less familiar pledge to build back in a \"more gender-neutral\" and \"feminine\" way. \nSo what does that mean? \nDowning Street sources are pointing to the PM's education announcement. Mr Johnson, I'm told, wants to improve the prospects of girls around the world. \nWhile the prime minister's terminology may cause some to cringe a little (\"ugh, just ugh,\" remarked one senior Tory MP), the underlying aim might attract praise, even if the UK government is temporarily cutting its overseas aid budget overall.\nBut, more broadly, the prime minister is keen to insert his \"build back better\" domestic agenda into the international scene. \n\"Build back better\" also happens to be the name of Joe Biden's mammoth jobs and recovery plan.\nFor any G7 leader, the world stage is still a chance to reach the audience at home.  \nMr Johnson has pledged the UK will donate more than 100 million Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union.\nBut some charities and campaigners have criticised the scale of the UK's plan, under which 5 million doses will be given out by the end of September, with 25 million by the end of 2021 and the rest provided during 2022. \nLis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was \"not happening anywhere near fast enough\", and called on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away.\nAnd US pop star Selena Gomez told her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that the promise to deliver 5 million vaccines by the end of September was \"too little too late\".\nMs Gomez was among a number of celebrities who took part in a concert aimed at increasing access to Covid vaccines in April. Mr Biden also appeared at the event, as did Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\nThe G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022.\nThe World Health Organization estimates 11 billion doses will be needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly affected.\nHundreds of people joined a march in St Ives, just along the coast from Carbis Bay, urging leaders to \"address the climate and ecological emergency\".\nThree people were arrested a few miles away from the summit venue earlier on suspicion of possession of an article with intent to commit criminal damage, and four were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance."

To many, Floyd's death while in police custody became a symbol of police brutality - particularly against people of colour - and it sparked worldwide demonstrations for racial justice. \nThe footage was used as evidence at Chauvin's murder trial earlier this year. He was later found guilty on three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. \nAt the murder trial, she told the court that witnessing Floyd's death had changed her life. \n\"When I look at George Floyd I look at my dad, I look at my brother, my cousins, my uncles - because they are all black,\" she said, audibly crying. \"And I look at how that could have been one of them.\""

      "text": "Regular and strenuous exercise increases the risk of motor neurone disease in people who are genetically vulnerable, say scientists. \nThe team at the University of Sheffield said nobody should stop exercising as a result of their study. \nBut they hope the findings could lead to ways of screening people who may be at higher risk and give tailored advice. \nOverall, around one in 300 people will develop motor neurone disease. \nIt affects people's ability to move, talk and even breathe as the motor neurones that carry messages from the brain to the muscles fail. It can dramatically shorten people's lives. \nWho gets it and why is a complicated, poorly-understood mix of the genetic risk you are born with and other environmental factors that build up over a lifetime. \nThere has long been a connection between exercise and the disease, but whether it was a genuine \"cause\" or just a \"coincidence\" has been the source of fierce debate. \nStudies in Italian footballers have suggested rates up to six times higher than normal. Athletes including Rob Burrow (rugby league), Stephen Darby (football) and Doddie Weir (rugby union) have all spoken openly about the disease.\n\"We have conclusively said exercise is a risk factor for motor neurone disease\", Dr Johnathan Cooper-Knock, one of the researchers, said.\n\"The numbers of high profile athletes affected with MND is not a coincidence.\"\nThe researchers analysed data from the UK Biobank project, which has detailed genetic samples from half a million people. \nThey used a technique called Mendelian randomisation to turn that data into an experiment, and showed people whose DNA makes them more likely to do strenuous activity were more likely to get MND.\nThe study, published in the journal EBioMedicine, also showed: \nStrenuous and regular was defined as more than 15-30 minutes on more than 2-3 days per week. But obviously, most people who exercise that much do not develop motor neurone disease. \nDr Cooper-Knock said: \"We don't know who is at risk and we wouldn't go as far as advising who should and shouldn't exercise.\n\"If everyone stopped exercising that would do more harm than good.\"\nThe hope is the work will eventually lead to a way of tailoring advice similar to screening footballers for heart problems.\nProf Dame Pamela Shaw, the director of the Neuroscience Institute in Sheffield, said: \"This research goes some way towards unravelling the link between high levels of physical activity and the development of MND in certain genetically at-risk groups.\"\nIt is thought low levels of oxygen in the body during strenuous exercise could be leading to a process called oxidative stress in the motor neurones - some of the biggest and most oxygen-demanding cells in the body.\nThis may lead to damage and eventually cause the cells to die in people who have that genetic vulnerability. \nDr Brian Dickie, from the Motor Neurone Disease Association said more research along these lines was needed.\nHe said the genetic and environmental components of MND were often studied in isolation whereas \"the power of this research comes from bringing these pieces of the puzzle together\".\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Boris Johnson says the UK will start donating coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks.\nMore than 100 million surplus doses will be delivered in the next year, he announced ahead of the G7 summit.\nUS President Joe Biden has promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union.\nFive million doses will be given by the UK by the end of September, with 25 million more by the end of the year.\nThe prime minister said: \"As a result of the success of the UK's vaccine programme we are now in a position to share some of our surplus doses with those who need them.\n\"In doing so we will take a massive step towards beating this pandemic for good.\"\nHe said he hoped his fellow leaders at the summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, which starts on Friday, would \"make similar pledges so that, together, we can vaccinate the world by the end of next year\". \nThe group of leaders of wealthy nations is expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of coronavirus vaccines in a collective effort to end the pandemic. \nThe leaders of Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy as well as the US and the UK, are also setting out a plan to expand vaccine manufacturing to help hit that goal.  \nSpeaking in Cornwall, Mr Biden said: \"The United States is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached. No strings attached.\n\"Our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions. We're doing this to save lives.\"\nIt is not the first contribution to global vaccination by the UK government - it has already donated more than \u00a3500m to Covax, the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest countries.\nAnd it helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is available at cost price - with two-thirds of the 400m doses going to low and middle-income countries, including 170m to India. \nMr Johnson wants the G7 leaders to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to also provide vaccines at cost price, while the pandemic continues. \nAbout a fifth of the doses being donated by the UK will be delivered through specific agreements with countries in need, with the rest being donated through Covax. \nSpeaking to the BBC, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi agreed that even with the G7 donation pledges \"fundamentally, there's a shortage\" to vaccinate everyone and called on manufacturers to scale up production across the world. \nHe also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global effort.\nHe added that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June.\nThe government has ordered more than 500m doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIt is hoped that the surplus doses of vaccine could help prevent the spread of the virus around the world and in doing so, restrict the emergence of more new variants. \nThe donations announcement comes after the UK went back on a commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, instead cutting that to 0.5%, citing the pandemic's effect on public finances.\nThe donation of vaccines will count as extra aid spending on top of the \u00a310bn promised under the reduced target.\nZoe Abrams, executive director at the British Red Cross, said the promise on vaccines was \"heartening\" but added: \"While every commitment must be welcomed, more needs to be done, and fast.\"\nAnd Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was \"not happening anywhere near fast enough\", calling on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away."

      "tags": "GDP,Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK economy grew 2.3% in April, its fastest monthly growth since July last year.\nShoppers spent more on the High Street as non-essential shops reopened, and people bought more cars and caravans.\nThere was also more spending in pubs, cafes and restaurants as restrictions eased the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nDespite the surge in activity, the UK economy is still 3.7% below its pre-pandemic peak.\nConstruction fell in April, compared to strong growth the previous month, but the sector remains above its pre-pandemic peak.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said that the figures were \"a promising sign that our economy is beginning to recover\".\nMr Sunak said more than one million people had come off the government's furlough scheme in March and April as businesses reopened.\nJonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics said: \"Strong growth in retail spending, increased car and caravan purchases, schools being open for the full month, and the beginning of the reopening of hospitality all boosted the economy in April.\"\nYael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said shoppers flocked back to the High Street as households spent some of their savings on non-essential goods.\nSpending in non-essential shops drove much of the growth as customers were allowed back into stores from 12 April in England, with clothes stores seeing a boost of 69.4%.\nOverall growth in the services sector was 3.4%, although it remains 4.1% below pre-pandemic levels of February 2020.\nThis included restaurants, bars and cafes, where customers could eat and drink outdoors again, seeing a 39% rise in growth.\nPeople also used the ability to travel across the country again, with activity at caravan parks and holiday lets growing 68.6%, while hairdressers and other personal services grew 63.5%.\nA further relaxation of lockdown rules is planned for 21 June, which would let pubs, bars and restaurants increase the number of people allowed indoors.\nBut that is now looking increasingly unlikely which may put downward pressure on growth in the summer.\nRegardless of any pause in reopening, Ms Selfin said economic activity levels in May and June would not rise at the same rate as the April rebound.\nOne of the ways the pandemic has turned normal assumptions upside down is that a shrinking economy can be the successful outcome of deliberate government policy.\nThe government wanted to suppress economic activity to combat the virus, the public largely abided by the restrictions, and the economy shrank.\nSimilarly when you ease restrictions, and that suppressed activity comes back, leading to the sort of growth in a month that you're more normally see in a year, it's a deliberate and predictable outcome of policy rather than a stellar economic performance. \nThe economy has been growing now since January. But the \"bounceback\" is slower than the 7.3% growth recorded in July 2020, when restrictions of much greater severity were being lifted.\nAnd we still have a steep hill to climb. At the end of the first quarter of the year our economy had taken the biggest knock of all the G20 economies, in stark contrast to the likes of Korea, Australia, India or Turkey, which had already recovered beyond pre-pandemic levels. \nThe confident official prediction is that we're in for 7% growth this year which should boost that weak international performance. Let's hope that confidence isn't misplaced. \nMiatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of UK think tank New Economics Foundation, told the BBC the figures were in line with what was expected \"which is a big bounce as the restrictions were eased and the economy starts going back to normal\".\n\"But underneath this is probably going to be a story of two halves - the GDP numbers tell us the economy is recovering, but it's likely to be uneven, with the bounceback driven by parts of the economy that have essentially been insulated from the worst parts of the pandemic, and other parts of the economy - those with no work, or small businesses - really, really struggling, particularly as the government starts removing some [support] going into the autumn.\"\nSeparately, there is continued friction in trade with EU due to post-Brexit restrictions, although less than at the start of the year.\nMr Athow from the ONS said: \"Exports of goods have now, broadly, recovered from the disruptions seen at the beginning of the year. However, imports of goods from the EU are still significantly down on 2020 levels\".\nCompared with three years ago - the last time trade was unaffected by either Covid or concerns of a disruptive Brexit - British goods exports to the EU this April were 7.1% lower and imports from the EU were 15.3% lower.\nExports to the EU were also below their average for 2019.\n\"That is a disappointing performance, given the boom in global trade flows; UK exporters have lost market share,\" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\nTotal imports of goods excluding precious metals in April rose 3.9% or \u00a31.4bn, while exports fell slightly."

      "tags": "Child abuse,Fort Augustus,Australia",
      "text": "A former monk at a Catholic boarding school has pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse, bringing to an end one victim's eight-year fight for justice.  \nFr Denis \"Chrysostom\" Alexander, who is now 85, admitted two charges of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices against two boys between 1973 and 1976.\nThe offences took place at the Fort Augustus Abbey school in the Highlands.\nAlexander, an Australian national, was first named as a paedophile by a BBC Scotland documentary in 2013. \nOne of his victims was Hugh Kennedy, now aged 58. He was in court and afterwards said his nightmare was \"now finally over.\" \nAlexander has been in custody in Australia and then Scotland since 2017. He will be sentenced next month.\nFort Augustus Abbey, at the southern end of Loch Ness, had been monastery for more than 100 years. The austere Benedictine monks who lived there operated a prestigious fee-paying Catholic boarding school, thought of as one of the best in the country.  \nThe imposing abbey and school buildings were neatly tucked away behind the trees on the outskirts of the town.\nThe monks were rarely seen by locals, and were thought of as an amusing peculiarity. At its peak, about 300 pupils would board at the school.\nHugh Kennedy enrolled in 1974; a wide-eyed, blonde-haired boy of 11 who loved sport.\nHe was exactly the type of boy expected to excel within this environment. \nBut the strict and regularly brutal regime at Fort Augustus, alongside a hierarchical culture of bullying by his peers, would soon have him living in fear. \nOne teacher in particular had started to single him out for special punishment. \nFr Denis Alexander, also known as Fr Chrysostom, was an Australian priest who had arrived at Fort Augustus in the 1950s, around the same time as his fellow Australians, Frs Aidan and Fabian Duggan. \nEach of this trio could be sadistically violent and would be eventually be exposed by the BBC as child sex abusers. \nHugh Kennedy says Alexander would call him to his room, where he would be told to take his pants down and he would cane his bare backside.\n\"He was softening me up, I now understand,\" Hugh says.\n\"I used to ask him why he was doing this but he just told me to shut up.\n\"I was receiving inexplicable beatings. He once made me kneel against the wall for six hours - he was terrorising me.\n\"Then suddenly it turned around on a sixpence. The beatings stopped; I was put back on his social list, which meant special treats like toast in his office, and yoga lessons. I was even made head altar boy. \n\"But this was all part of the grooming process, just to get me used to saying yes to everything.\"\nSoon after, the sexual abuse started. \nOne night, in the dormitory Hugh shared with more than a dozen other boys, he awoke with a start to the smell of whisky close to his face. Alexander had crept into Hugh's dorm and abused him on his top bunk while the boy below him slept.  \n\"By the next day, I'd convinced myself it hadn't happened,\" Hugh says. \nBut the abuse escalated, and during a yoga class, Alexander carried out a serious sexual attack on Hugh. \n\"He told me it was a special thing between the two of us and no-one needed to know about it, and that no-one would believe me in any case,\" Hugh says. \nThe abuse by Alexander stopped, but later he was abused by another man at the school - an art teacher called Bill Owen, who is now dead - fuelling fears that abusive staff had shared victims.\nHugh says the abuse by Owen was serious and lasted several years.\n\"I believe it was organised, that there was a bit of 'pass the parcel' going on,\" Hugh says.\nHugh decided to tell someone about the abuse by Alexander. \nHe told his step-mother and the headmaster at the time, Fr Francis Davidson. \nHowever, Davidson took Alexander's side and allowed the monk to visit Hugh's step-mother at home, to persuade her that her son was lying.\nIt worked, and Hugh was returned to the school. The police were never called. \nFr Chrysostom, who was known as the \"piping monk\" because of his love of the bagpipes, was free to carry on abusing. \nAnd he did. \nNearly a decade ago, alongside producer Murdoch Rodgers, I started investigating allegations of abuse at Fort Augustus. \nWe met former Fort Augustus pupil Brendan, not his real name, who told us he had been repeatedly abused by Alexander when aged 13.\nHe had struggled with his mental health throughout his life, a condition rooted in, he believes, the abuse he suffered at the hands of the monk he knew as Fr Chrysostom\nIt was Brendan's story which started us on our path of investigating Alexander, who we knew had abruptly returned to his native Australia in 1977. \nBrendan had raised the alarm about Alexander's abuse, and his parents complained to the school. The matter was once more dealt with internally by Fr Francis Davidson. There would be no police involvement, but this time Alexander was sent home to Australia. \nI had wanted to find and confront Alexander in Australia but needed more evidence.\nThen Brendan told us about a letter he'd been written by Alexander. It had been an apology - a confession - written to him and his parents on his return to Australia. \nBrendan told us he'd been so angry he'd ripped it into pieces and threw it in the bin. Crucial evidence, apparently destroyed 35 years previously in the heat of the moment \nBut unknown to Brendan, his father had taped it back together and kept it.\nThe letter reads: \"I am writing this letter with some consideration to apologise for the events of last term. I ask forgiveness not only for the incidents themselves but for the considerable distress it must have caused\u2026\n\"All I can say is that I was under severe strain for the past 18 months\u2026\"\nIt was all the evidence I needed. I tracked Alexander down to a quiet suburb of Sydney.\nHe'd been allowed to take up the priesthood in Australia without any prior warnings about his offending being given by the Benedictines.  \nIn fact, he'd been sent a cheque for \u00a350,000 in 2000 by the Benedictines, after the Fort Augustus Abbey had been closed and its affairs wound up. This was despite his confession about abusing children.\nUnfettered by allegations about his past, he worked as a supply priest in Sydney for more than 20 years, attending holy communions and baptisms up until his retirement in the 2000s. \nCameraman Alan Harcus and I watched his home for eight days, waiting for the opportunity to put Brendan's allegations to him. Finally, just hours before we were due to fly home, he emerged from his front door. \nThe former monk refused to engage with my questions, told me to \"go to blazes\" and get off his property, then rammed his car into mine. \nHe'd been defiant, but this was a watershed moment in the investigation. The clock was now running.\nThe confrontation featured our 2013 documentary Sins of Our Fathers, which sparked a chain of events which ultimately would lead to the setting up of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and a major police investigation into Alexander and others.\nThe programme and subsequent follow-ups named more than a dozen Fort Augustus monks as abusers and several headmasters, including Fr Davidson, of covering up the abuse. Davidson, who is now dead, resigned from a religious post at Oxford university in the wake of the scandal. \nIn 2013, Hugh Kennedy had just gone to the police about his abuse, and after watching the film, decided to speak publicly.   \nHugh had struggled with his mental health throughout his life and believes his experiences at Fort Augustus contributed to a breakdown of his marriage and put pressure on other relationships. \nHe told me then that he wanted to apologise to his family \"for what I put them through\". \nHe said that Alexander had to face the consequences for his actions, saying, \"I will face Chrysostom if needs be\u2026 because this is a bogeyman that's been on my shoulder my whole life.\"\nToday, he says that had he known what the experience of going through the criminal justice system would be for a survivor of child sexual abuse, he would never have come forward. \n\"It has been eight years of pain,\" Hugh said.\nJuly 2013: BBC airs Sins of Our Fathers, revealing decades of sexual and physical abuse at the Fort Augustus Abbey School and Carlkemp preparatory school, and confronts Fr Alexander in Sydney\nDecember 2015: The Crown announces plans to extradite Fr Alexander back to Scotland\nJanuary 2017: Fr Alexander is arrested in Sydney and remanded in custody\nMay 2017: Fr Alexander is found eligible for extradition by an Australian court. He appeals, claiming he is too ill to travel\nMarch 2019: The attorney general of Australia determines that Fr Alexander be surrendered to the UK. Fr Alexander seeks a judicial review.\nSeptember 2019: The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry takes evidence about Fort Augustus\nNovember 2019: The Federal Court of Australia dismisses Fr Alexander's application for a judicial review\nDecember 2019: Fr Alexander fails to lodge an appeal against the federal court ruling within the 28-day deadline\nJanuary 2020: Fr Alexander is extradited to Scotland\nJune 2021: Fr Alexander pleads guilty to two charges\nWhat followed for Hugh Kennedy was a rollercoaster eight years of not knowing whether his abuser would ever face justice. \nIt was more than two years before the Crown Office sought Alexander's extradition from Australia, then another two years before he was arrested. In the meantime, the BBC continued to report on Hugh's case and ask questions about the delays.\nAlexander had claimed he was too ill to be extradited and lodged several appeals. He had told the BBC before his arrest that he was being supported by the Catholic Church in Sydney, although this was denied by the church.\nEventually, having expended all legal means of defiance, he was flown to Scotland in January last year.\n\"I was told the matter would be dealt with swiftly and expected a trial within a few months,\" said Hugh.\nBut then the pandemic struck, and justice ground to halt. Even once trials resumed, Hugh felt the case had been put on the back burner. \n\"It was almost as if it would have been easier for them if he just passed away in his cell.\n\"To survive the abuse is one thing, but to survive going through the criminal justice system is another thing altogether. The journey is horrific. \n\"I was continually kept in the dark.\n\"There's so much that could have been done differently. There seems to be no insight into the mental trauma involved for victims. \n\"Initially I put my trust in these people, but then found myself being let down continually. There's a lack of compassion, you're treated dismissively and there seems to be total lack training for staff dealing with these sorts of situations\n\"I would have crumbled if it wasn't for the support I was getting. I've got a fairly strong constitution but I've not been particularly well during this process, and people with lesser capacity would have sunk and gone away.\n\"If the BBC hadn't been continually covering this case, I doubt I had the ability to get it this far. What about all the other people who haven't journalists keeping the story in the public eye? They've got no chance of getting a case like this to court.\n\"Something has to change to make it easier for people to go through this process.\"\nUntil three days ago, Hugh had been living in fear that the case would be abandoned because of Alexander's failing health, or that he would die before going to trial. \nOn Wednesday morning, he was told of Alexander's intention to plead guilty.\nIn a voice racked with emotion, Hugh had struggled to get the words out when he called. \n\"All I've ever wanted was for him to admit what he's done to me and the others,\" he said.\n\"It's finally over.\"\nHe travelled up from the south of England overnight to see his \"bogeyman\" one final time. \nDressed in a green prison jumper, Alexander listened to the court proceedings in his wheelchair.\nHis defence counsel said the man sitting in court was very different to the one who carried out the offences.\nHugh says he is now ready to get on with his life. The ghosts of Fort Augustus are fading, and despite the struggle, he knows he has achieved something that for years had hung in the balance. He'd survived, and he'd won justice. \nHe said: \"There are others who didn't feel able to go through with this. So even if it has been a living nightmare for eight years, I feel I did something right, for Brendan, for me, and for the others who didn't make it this far.\""

      "text": "Monday was meant to be the moment when the government declared the pandemic was effectively over in England. The plan had been to give a week's notice that all restrictions would end on 21 June.  \nBut the prospect of that happening is now looking increasingly unlikely following the rise of the Delta variant. Behind the scenes, government scientists have been warning ministers this week that caution is needed.\nWhy do we appear to be stumbling at the final hurdle?\nIt was always expected that infection rates would rise at this point - allowing indoor mixing was the move that provides the most opportunity for the virus to spread.\nAnd with Office for National Statistics data showing eight in 10 adults are currently testing positive for antibodies - a result of both vaccination and previous infection - there are still plenty of susceptible people for it to infect.\nBut what has become clear in the past few days is that the trajectory we are on is steeper than many had hoped, because of the more infectious Delta variant, thought to be 40% to 80% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, first identified in Kent.\nAt the current rate of growth the UK will hit 15,000 cases a day by 21 June and January levels of infections by late July - and that's without the further relaxation of restrictions due, which could drive up cases even more.\n\"It's very clear where infection rates are heading now - and it's not where we wanted to be or thought we would be just a few weeks ago. That's why we're concerned,\" says one of the scientists on Sage, the group which advises ministers. \nWhat is less clear, however, is what this means for hospital cases. \nIt is often said that vaccination has broken the link between infections and hospitalisations - and if people are not getting seriously sick, then it does not matter if infection levels rise.\nBut at this stage it appears to have weakened it rather than broken it. Admissions have already started rising, albeit not as fast as they did in September, the last time infections were rising at this rate.\nThe rate of hospitalisations appears to be less than half of what it was then, although there are only a few days of data to draw on so scientists cannot be certain. This is one of the reasons why they are asking ministers for more time to monitor the data.\nBut if we assume that link is right, it suggests 4% of cases being identified end up needing hospital treatment. That could equate to 2,000 admissions a day if we do reach January level infection rates - twice what the NHS would normally see in the depths of a bad winter for respiratory illness. A small percentage of a very big number can still be a big number.\nHowever, the data on its own does not tell the full story. There is evidence the people being admitted to hospital are younger and less seriously ill than in previous waves, and so need less treatment and spend less time in hospital. \nThere seems to be very few doubled-jabbed patients despite those being the most at risk of serious illness - providing further confidence about just how well the vaccines work.\nThat in turn will mean many many fewer deaths. In a couple of weeks, scientists believe they will be able to give ministers a better idea of what is going to happen than they can now, meaning there will be greater confidence about the impact of a full unlocking.\nBut as well as time to analyse the data, a delay also has the benefit of helping to vaccinate more people.\nEvidence gathered by Public Health England shows that getting a second dose is crucial to stemming the spread of the Delta variant.\nAfter one shot, both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines appear to stop about a third of infections caused by the Delta variant, compared with about half for the Alpha variant.\nBut for both the protection offered after a second dose remained high - showing that despite the variants every vaccination still brings us closer to ending the pandemic.\nCurrently just over half of adults are fully vaccinated while another quarter have received one shot. With half a million doses a day being given on average, those figures will be substantially higher in just a few weeks. \n\"There is a clear public health benefit to a delay as well as providing time to analyse the data,\" says Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the modellers analysing the figures for ministers.\nOf course, if infection rates keep rising - and that in turn drags up hospital admissions albeit not at the same pace as before - there is a risk that could leave England waiting for months before restrictions end completely.\nBut there is good reason to hope the rise in cases may be over more quickly than it has been in previous waves and without the need for extra restrictions.\nThe evidence from Bolton offers some hope of that. Infections started rising rapidly in early May as the Delta variant took hold. \nThe wave though was quite different from what went before - with very low numbers of over-60s, the group that was mostly double-jabbed by that point, infected.\nInfections spread quickly through younger age groups, but soon stopped.\nChanges in behaviour, surge testing and the push on vaccinations that have taken place will have played a role, but so too did the wall of immunity the virus came up against.\nDr Adam Kucharski, an infectious diseases expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, believes infection levels may not take off significantly in some areas because of their high levels of vaccination.\n\"I think there will be quite big differences in infection rates between areas. In communities where immunity levels are high and contacts low, we may not see infection rates climb that much.\"\nA delay to the complete ending of restrictions does not mean it will never come.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nLifting the last Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be delayed to \"stop us going backwards\", public health officials have said. The Association of Directors of Public Health said unlocking would risk an increase in hospital admissions. The government will make a final decision on whether to unlock on Monday. Concerns about the Delta variant, first identified in India, continue: as of yesterday, if the current rate of increase continued there would be 15,000 cases a day by 21 June.\nThe Delta variant is roughly 60% more transmissible than the Alpha, or Kent, variant and could make people more seriously ill, Public Health England has said. Nearly two-thirds of people infected with the Delta variant, and more than half of those who have died with it, have not had a Covid vaccine at all, the latest official data suggests. The Delta variant is now the dominant variant in the UK, accounting for 90% of cases. Officials stressed that two doses of the vaccine provide \"significantly more protection\" than one.\nEuro 2020 is finally kicking off this evening after it was delayed due to the pandemic (and yes, it decided to keep its somewhat outdated name).

Find out how to watch the games with your friends here.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged fellow leaders to \"build back better\" as the world recovers from the Covid pandemic, during his opening comments at the G7 summit of world leaders. He earlier pledged to donate more than 100 million Covid vaccines to poorer countries, with US President Joe Biden promising 500 million doses. World Health Organization (WHO) special envoy on Covid-19, Dr David Nabarro, said richer countries giving doses to poorer countries was \"not charity, it's self-interest\", explaining: \"The whole world can only recover if the pandemic is dealt with everywhere.\"\nParkrun events could soon return in more than 500 locations on 26 June after organisers said they were \"fearful for our future\". Lots of local authorities have now approved the free 5km events, which were due to resume on 5 June but were delayed after only a third of landowners gave permission. The new restart date is subject to the UK government's coronavirus roadmap announcement on 14 June.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nOur understanding of the virus has evolved throughout the pandemic - check out the latest thinking on how to protect yourself here.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Maya Forstater: Woman wins tribunal appeal over transgender tweets",
      "tags": "Human rights,Employment tribunals,LGBT,Transgender people",
      "text": "A woman who lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex has won an appeal against an employment tribunal.\nMaya Forstater, 47, did not have her contract renewed after posting tweets on gender recognition.\nShe lost her original case at a tribunal in 2019, but a High Court judge ruled her \"gender-critical\" beliefs fell under the Equalities Act.\nThe appeal said the tribunal had erred in law and another should take place.\nMs Forstater, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, did not have her contract renewed at the think tank Center for Global Development (CGD) in March 2019, after posting a series of tweets questioning government plans - which were later scrapped - to let people declare their own gender.\nShe claimed she was discriminated against because of her beliefs, which include \"that sex is immutable and not to be conflated with gender identity\".\nIn the initial tribunal employment judge James Tayler said that her approach was \"not worthy of respect in a democratic society\".\nHe concluded that Ms Forstater was \"absolutist\" in her view and said she was not entitled to ignore the rights of a transgender person and the \"enormous pain that can be caused by misgendering\".\nBut the Honourable Mr Justice Choudhury said her \"gender-critical beliefs\" did fall under the Equalities Act as they \"did not seek to destroy the rights of trans persons\".\nMs Forstater said she was \"delighted to have been vindicated\" but CGD said the decision was a \"step backwards for inclusivity and equality for all\".\nIn a video statement, Ms Forstater said: \"I'm proud of the role I've played in clarifying the law and encouraging more people to speak up\". \nAmanda Glassman, executive vice president of CGD, said: \"The decision is disappointing and surprising because we believe Judge Tayler got it right when he found this type of offensive speech causes harm to trans people, and therefore could not be protected under the Equality Act. \n\"Today's decision is a step backwards for inclusivity and equality for all.\"\nMaya Forstater won her case because the Employment Appeal Tribunal concluded that her belief that biological sex is real, important and immutable met the legal test of a genuine and important philosophical position that is protected under the UK's equality laws. \nThe test for such a protection was that her belief touched on an important part of human life, would be accepted by others and - this is the important bit - could not be shown to be a direct attempt to harm others. \nThe appeal panel found that while her words were offensive to some, they fell far short of the violent and oppressive views of \"Nazism or totalitarian\". There was not even any evidence that she had harassed anyone at work. \nWhere does this leave employers? Equality and employment law require them to recognise and uphold the rights of all in the workplace. \nMs Forstater's speech and beliefs are protected - but so are the rights of trans people. And if speech crosses the line from an honestly held belief to bullying, attacks and intimidation, then the scales very obviously tip in favour of protecting the victim. \nMr Justice Choudhury acknowledged that some transgender people would be disappointed by this judgement, but said it had not \"expressed any view on the merits of either side of the transgender debate\".\nThe judgement does not mean \"that those with gender-critical beliefs can 'misgender' trans persons with impunity\", he added. \nAnd he said it does not mean \"that employers and service providers will not be able to provide a safe environment for trans persons\".\nCGD said it was considering various paths forward with its lawyers and said it disputed Ms Forstater's version of events.\nThe sole issue considered by the appeal tribunal was whether the original tribunal had been wrong not to consider Ms Forstater's views as a philosophical belief protected by the Equality Act.\nOther matters of the case, such as her employment status or whether she was discriminated against, would have to be decided at a fresh tribunal.\nBaroness Falkner, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said there was a difference between holding a belief and how it was expressed.\nShe said: \"Some may see the beliefs of others as questionable or controversial, but people must be free to hold them.\n\"This is why this case is so important.\" \nMonica Kurnatowska, employment partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said the ruling meant that \"individuals are entitled not to be discriminated against because of gender critical beliefs... and gives those beliefs the same legal protection as religious beliefs, environmental beliefs and ethical veganism\".\n\"Employers will be watching closely for any guidance on how to handle employee conflict fairly and lawfully, while respecting the rights of all involved,\" she added.\nLui Asquith, director of legal and policy at Mermaids, a charity that supports transgender, non-binary and gender-diverse children and young people, said: \"This is not the win anti-trans campaigners will suggest in the coming days. \n\"We, as trans people, are protected by equality law and this decision in the Maya Forstater case does not give anyone the right to unlawfully harass, intimidate, abuse or discriminate against us because we are trans.\"\nMs Forstater's case gained public attention, including some high-profile supporters such as Harry Potter author JK Rowling and presenter Jonathan Ross."

May they be a reminder of all that we can achieve when we come together as a society.\"\nProf Gilbert, who becomes a dame, is recognised on the list alongside six Oxford University colleagues involved in the creation of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been given to tens of millions of people around the world.\nShe said it was important to recognise \"the large number of people who worked very hard to get this vaccine developed, manufactured, tested in trials... and now the people working on the vaccine rollout\".\nVenture capitalist Ms Bingham is similarly honoured after overseeing the procurement of the millions of vaccine doses now being offered to the nation.\nShe told the BBC she was \"humbled\", and that she hoped her legacy would inspire more women to pursue careers in the science sector.\nThere is also further recognition for the success of the UK's vaccination programme.\nA knighthood is awarded to Prof Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection at the University of Oxford, for services to public health particularly during Covid-19.\nIan McCubbin, manufacturing expert on the Vaccine Taskforce Steering Committee, Vaccine Taskforce, and Mark Proctor, global supply strategy director at AstraZeneca, are appointed CBE.\nMeanwhile, Divya Chadha Manek becomes an OBE for her work in the research and development of vaccines and the resulting clinical trials.\nShe said the honour felt like \"a real nod to clinical research which may not always get the spotlight it deserves\". \nProf Linda Bauld is made an OBE for \"guiding the public health response to, and public understanding of, Covid-19\". The Edinburgh University behavioural scientist, has been a regular face on TV screens and an adviser to the Scottish Parliament's Covid-19 committee.\nA wealth of honours also go to acknowledging the people who found ways to make a difference throughout the pandemic - from running free taxis for key workers to making bottles of hand sanitiser.\nBritish Empire Medals go to brother and sister John Brownhill and Amanda Guest, who were inspired to set up Food4Heroes - which delivered food from local chefs to NHS frontline staff - after watching Yorkshire nurse Dawn Bilborough's viral video reaction after facing empty shelves at the end of a long shift. \nThey have since delivered more than 200,000 meals to the NHS, and are now looking at setting up community caf\u00e9s, with the hope that they could provide work for the unemployed.\n\"You see in a time of crisis the strengths of humanity, I think,\" Mr Brownhill said.\nA BEM also goes to Rhys Mallows, 25, from South Glamorgan, who repurposed his whiskey distillery to produce more than one million bottles of hand sanitiser for the NHS, key workers and the general public.\n\"When you see that need in a community... if you've got an ability to make a difference when very few can, I think you have to make that decision,\" he said.\nMichael Taggart, strategic domestic abuse officer for North Wales Police, is appointed MBE for services to victims of domestic abuse.\nHe has supported victims of domestic abuse throughout his career, and his work highlighting the hidden victims of these crimes has become even more important in light of coronavirus restrictions.\nDuring the pandemic, he organised a campaign to reach out to potential victims of abuse, involving partnership with commercial businesses such as Tesco's home delivery service, food banks and pharmacies across North Wales.\nMr Taggart, whose mother was murdered by his stepfather in 1997 when he was just 15, said it was \"incredible\" to see where his work had got him but that it was \"somewhat bittersweet\". \n\"Although mum is not here, she's obviously here in spirit, but I'm sure she would be very proud,\" he said.\nFormer Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips said her damehood recognised \"how important dance is to people\", while Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith said being honoured for doing something she loves was \"just the icing on the cake\". \nActor Jonathan Pryce, who will play the late Duke of Edinburgh in the final seasons of The Crown, said he was \"proud\" to receive his knighthood, adding: \"That the UK continues to honour those that work in the arts, acknowledges the great contribution artists make to the way we live our lives.\"\nHis long career includes award-winning theatre roles in London and New York, and performances in Hollywood hits including Evita and Pirates of the Caribbean.\nOf his MBE, Engelbert Humperdinck said the news had \"really brought such a spark to light the flame once again to continue to do what I love\u2026sing\".\nThe wider creative arts are given a spotlight in the latest honours list with writing, sculpture, poetry and pottery getting a nod.\nDame\nCBE\nOBE \nMBE\nRead more: Queen honours TV's Arlene Phillips and Prue Leith\nIn sport, Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson is appointed MBE after he raised \u00a34 million for the NHS from fellow Premier League footballers through the #PlayersTogether appeal.\nFormer England football team manager Roy Hodgson is appointed CBE, and director of rugby at Leeds Rhinos Kevin Sinfield is appointed OBE for services to Rugby League and charitable fundraising for motor neurone disease. \nIn politics, Conservative former minister Andrea Leadsom is made a dame.

He didn't have the guts to call it out, he hedged his bets and in doing so he undermined the team on the verge of this competition.\n\"He didn't have the courage to stand by the England team on the verge of this competition, and he's wrong about that and that's a failure of leadership.\"\nFormer Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has praised England players for taking the knee - adding they were \"bringing the whole country together\".\nIn an interview recorded on Thursday, Mr Brown told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that the team had taken a \"difficult decision\" in adopting the gesture - which England player Marcus Rashford has called the \"right thing to do\".\nHe added: \"I don't think it was right for Downing Street not to support Marcus Rashford.\n\"Marcus Rashford has stood up for some really good causes over the last year, but he's also stood up for far better race relations and community relations in this country. So we should support the team when it does this.\nMr Brown, who was Labour prime minister from 2007 to 2010, told Nick Robinson he would \"like Boris Johnson to come out publicly to support the England football team in what they do\".\nHe warned it would be \"bad for Britain\" if \"culture wars started to develop\" and \"people seized on one instance of someone doing something and trying to make it a big issue that divided the public rather than united the public\".\nOn Friday, Scotland Manager Steve Clarke said the players had decided to take the knee for their game against England next Friday to show \"solidarity\" with England players \"on the receiving end of abuse from fans\".\nThe Scotland players will continue to stand for their other games during the tournament. \nMr Clark added that the team had \"reflected\" on the matter as a group, after \"divisive and inaccurate comments\" about their decision to stand instead of kneel.\n\"We remain committed to our principles of taking a stand, but we must also be unequivocal in condemning the opportunistic false narrative being presented by some,\" he added. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed the team's stance, saying that taking the knee alongside England players was a \"good decision\".\nAsked about the booing on Sunday, Mr Rashford said: \"It's something that we can't control, and for us we believe [taking the knee is] the right thing to do, so we're going to continue to do it.\"\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has said his team's gesture, adopted throughout the last Premier League season, is not \"political\" but an attempt to highlight racial injustice.\nWales will also take the knee at Euro 2020.\nOn BBC One's Question Time on Thursday, Ms Keegan said people were \"perfectly free\" to take the knee, but added it was \"symbolism more than action\".\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he \"absolutely\" backed the \"symbolism of reminding the world of how painful it is to be subjected to the racism that Marcus Rashford has been subjected to\".\nHe added: \"If you then extrapolate to a Black Lives Matter movement that has a political agenda... that's a different place... which is why I think we just have to differentiate and rightly back our team.\"\nAmerican footballer Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the pre-game national anthem in the NFL in 2016, in protest at police violence against African-Americans.\nSince last year, when the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in the US, many sportspeople around the world have chosen to take the knee.\nNick Robinson's interview with Gordon Brown will be broadcast at 17:30 BST on Saturday on BBC Radio 4.

We will not rest until justice is done,\" she said. \nShe said she hoped President Biden, who lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter, and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a car crash in 1972, would be \"sympathetic\". \n\"When someone has experienced such a tragic loss as he has, we've always hoped that he would be able to understand why justice is so important to us.\"\nThe family wants Ms Sacoolas to be stripped of diplomatic immunity in order to face a British court over the death. \nShe flew home days after the crash, when Washington told London that she had diplomatic immunity - meaning there could be no criminal prosecution. \nThose international rules protect officials and their families from unjust interference from host nations while they are stationed abroad. \nThe Crown Prosecution Service disagreed and issued an extradition request, saying Ms Sacoolas must face trial for causing Mr Dunn's death by dangerous driving, an offence which can lead to a maximum sentence of 14 years. \nFormer President Donald Trump's administration rejected the extradition request and refused to waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, which Mrs Charles said had left \"quite deep emotional scars\".\nSpeaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg at the G7 in Cornwall, Mr Johnson confirmed he and President Biden were now \"working together\" - although he stressed that \"legal processes\" had to be allowed to take their course. \n\"I have to say that you should really, when you get the chance, put your question to the president because he is actively engaged in the case,\" said the prime minister. \"He has his own personal reasons for feeling very deeply about the issue.\" \nMr Johnson continued: \"He was extremely sympathetic, but this is not something that either government can control very easily because there are legal processes that are still going on. \n\"I think the difficulty is that there are limits to what the executive can do with the legal, with the judiciary and the legal system, but both sides are working together.\"\nWhile Mr Dunn's parents wait for the possibility of justice via a criminal trial, a senior judge in the US has given them permission to sue Anne Sacoolas and her husband, Jonathan. \nMrs Charles said the family was \"tired but we're not going to rest until justice is done\".\n\"It doesn't get any easier, we're still not living with those scars yet because we're still yet to really grieve,\" she added."

      "text": "Regular and strenuous exercise increases the risk of motor neurone disease in people who are genetically vulnerable, say scientists. \nThe team at the University of Sheffield said nobody should stop exercising as a result of their study. \nBut they hope the findings could lead to ways of screening people who may be at higher risk and give tailored advice. \nOverall, around one in 300 people will develop motor neurone disease. \nIt affects people's ability to move, talk and even breathe as the motor neurones that carry messages from the brain to the muscles fail. It can dramatically shorten people's lives. \nWho gets it and why is a complicated, poorly-understood mix of the genetic risk you are born with and other environmental factors that build up over a lifetime. \nThere has long been a connection between exercise and the disease, but whether it was a genuine \"cause\" or just a \"coincidence\" has been the source of fierce debate. \nStudies in Italian footballers have suggested rates up to six times higher than normal. Athletes including Rob Burrow (rugby league), Stephen Darby (football) and Doddie Weir (rugby union) have all spoken openly about the disease.\n\"We have conclusively said exercise is a risk factor for motor neurone disease\", Dr Johnathan Cooper-Knock, one of the researchers, said.\n\"The numbers of high profile athletes affected with MND is not a coincidence.\"\nThe researchers analysed data from the UK Biobank project, which has detailed genetic samples from half a million people. \nThey used a technique called Mendelian randomisation to turn that data into an experiment, and showed people whose DNA makes them more likely to do strenuous activity were more likely to get MND.\nThe study, published in the journal EBioMedicine, also showed: \nStrenuous and regular was defined as more than 15-30 minutes on more than 2-3 days per week. But obviously, most people who exercise that much do not develop motor neurone disease. \nDr Cooper-Knock said: \"We don't know who is at risk and we wouldn't go as far as advising who should and shouldn't exercise.\n\"If everyone stopped exercising that would do more harm than good.\"\nThe hope is the work will eventually lead to a way of tailoring advice similar to screening footballers for heart problems.\nProf Dame Pamela Shaw, the director of the Neuroscience Institute in Sheffield, said: \"This research goes some way towards unravelling the link between high levels of physical activity and the development of MND in certain genetically at-risk groups.\"\nIt is thought low levels of oxygen in the body during strenuous exercise could be leading to a process called oxidative stress in the motor neurones - some of the biggest and most oxygen-demanding cells in the body.\nThis may lead to damage and eventually cause the cells to die in people who have that genetic vulnerability. \nDr Brian Dickie, from the Motor Neurone Disease Association said more research along these lines was needed.\nHe said the genetic and environmental components of MND were often studied in isolation whereas \"the power of this research comes from bringing these pieces of the puzzle together\".\nFollow James on Twitter"

It counts major series such as Battlefield, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, The Sims, and Titanfall among the titles it develops or publishes - as well as a vast array of annual sports games.\n\"We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,\" an EA spokesperson said in a statement.\n\"No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy,\" she added.\nThe company said it had already improved security and stated that it did not expect \"an impact on our games or our business\".\nLaw enforcement has also been contacted.\nThe \"network intrusion\" was not a ransomware attack and had happened recently, EA added.\nIn its report, Vice said it had seen screenshots of the hacking forums used by the attackers, who are advertising the stolen data for sale.\nSource code is a version of computer software which is usually much easier to read and understand than the end version in a finished product, and could be used to reverse engineer parts of the product.\nFor example, the Frostbite engine, which hackers claim to have the source code for, is a powerful game creation tool used in dozens of games, from FIFA to the Battlefield series and several recent Star Wars games from EA.\nThe source code for the engine could hold significant value for an unscrupulous developer willing to copy it, or for those making cheat codes and hacks for games.\nBut it is unlikely that any mainstream competitor to EA would ever use such stolen data.\nIt is the latest in a string of high-profile gaming company hacks.\nIn November last year, Capcom, the maker of Street Fighter and Resident Evil, suffered a ransomware attack which may have revealed the personal information of up to 350,000 people.\nAnd in February, Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red suffered another ransomware attack which resulted in the source code for several games being stolen and auctioned off online.\nIn that case, the hackers claimed to have sold the data for more than $7m (\u00a34.9m), though it is not clear if the sale actually happened."

      "title": "June 21: Why lockdown easing may be delayed",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Monday was meant to be the moment when the government declared the pandemic was effectively over in England. The plan had been to give a week's notice that all restrictions would end on 21 June.  \nBut the prospect of that happening is now looking increasingly unlikely following the rise of the Delta variant. Behind the scenes, government scientists have been warning ministers this week that caution is needed.\nWhy do we appear to be stumbling at the final hurdle?\nIt was always expected that infection rates would rise at this point - allowing indoor mixing was the move that provides the most opportunity for the virus to spread.\nAnd with Office for National Statistics data showing eight in 10 adults are currently testing positive for antibodies - a result of both vaccination and previous infection - there are still plenty of susceptible people for it to infect.\nBut what has become clear in the past few days is that the trajectory we are on is steeper than many had hoped, because of the more infectious Delta variant, thought to be 40% to 80% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, first identified in Kent.\nAt the current rate of growth the UK will hit 15,000 cases a day by 21 June and January levels of infections by late July - and that's without the further relaxation of restrictions due, which could drive up cases even more.\n\"It's very clear where infection rates are heading now - and it's not where we wanted to be or thought we would be just a few weeks ago. That's why we're concerned,\" says one of the scientists on Sage, the group which advises ministers. \nWhat is less clear, however, is what this means for hospital cases. \nIt is often said that vaccination has broken the link between infections and hospitalisations - and if people are not getting seriously sick, then it does not matter if infection levels rise.\nBut at this stage it appears to have weakened it rather than broken it. Admissions have already started rising, albeit not as fast as they did in September, the last time infections were rising at this rate.\nThe rate of hospitalisations appears to be less than half of what it was then, although there are only a few days of data to draw on so scientists cannot be certain. This is one of the reasons why they are asking ministers for more time to monitor the data.\nBut if we assume that link is right, it suggests 4% of cases being identified end up needing hospital treatment. That could equate to 2,000 admissions a day if we do reach January level infection rates - twice what the NHS would normally see in the depths of a bad winter for respiratory illness. A small percentage of a very big number can still be a big number.\nHowever, the data on its own does not tell the full story. There is evidence the people being admitted to hospital are younger and less seriously ill than in previous waves, and so need less treatment and spend less time in hospital. \nThere seems to be very few doubled-jabbed patients despite those being the most at risk of serious illness - providing further confidence about just how well the vaccines work.\nThat in turn will mean many many fewer deaths. In a couple of weeks, scientists believe they will be able to give ministers a better idea of what is going to happen than they can now, meaning there will be greater confidence about the impact of a full unlocking.\nBut as well as time to analyse the data, a delay also has the benefit of helping to vaccinate more people.\nEvidence gathered by Public Health England shows that getting a second dose is crucial to stemming the spread of the Delta variant.\nAfter one shot, both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines appear to stop about a third of infections caused by the Delta variant, compared with about half for the Alpha variant.\nBut for both the protection offered after a second dose remained high - showing that despite the variants every vaccination still brings us closer to ending the pandemic.\nCurrently just over half of adults are fully vaccinated while another quarter have received one shot. With half a million doses a day being given on average, those figures will be substantially higher in just a few weeks. \n\"There is a clear public health benefit to a delay as well as providing time to analyse the data,\" says Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the modellers analysing the figures for ministers.\nOf course, if infection rates keep rising - and that in turn drags up hospital admissions albeit not at the same pace as before - there is a risk that could leave England waiting for months before restrictions end completely.\nBut there is good reason to hope the rise in cases may be over more quickly than it has been in previous waves and without the need for extra restrictions.\nThe evidence from Bolton offers some hope of that. Infections started rising rapidly in early May as the Delta variant took hold. \nThe wave though was quite different from what went before - with very low numbers of over-60s, the group that was mostly double-jabbed by that point, infected.\nInfections spread quickly through younger age groups, but soon stopped.\nChanges in behaviour, surge testing and the push on vaccinations that have taken place will have played a role, but so too did the wall of immunity the virus came up against.\nDr Adam Kucharski, an infectious diseases expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, believes infection levels may not take off significantly in some areas because of their high levels of vaccination.\n\"I think there will be quite big differences in infection rates between areas. In communities where immunity levels are high and contacts low, we may not see infection rates climb that much.\"\nA delay to the complete ending of restrictions does not mean it will never come.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Lifting the last Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be delayed to \"stop us going backwards\", public health officials have said.\nUnlocking then would risk an increase in hospital admissions, the Association of Directors of Public Health said.\nThe government is expected to announce on Monday whether it will remove the last of the restrictions a week later.\nMinister Nadhim Zahawi said it had to be careful not to squander the progress made in tackling the virus.\nThe final stage of lifting restrictions would see all legal limits on social contact removed. Nightclubs would reopen, and restrictions on performances, weddings and other life events would also be lifted.\nBut concerns about the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, have led some scientists to call for a delay to ending lockdown.\nPublic Health England (PHE) estimates the variant is roughly 60% more spreadable than the previously dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, and could make people more seriously ill.\nThe latest official data suggests there have been nearly 30,000 new UK cases of the Delta variant in the past week, accounting for 90% of cases.\nPHE said nearly two thirds of people infected with the Delta variant have not had a vaccine at all.\nAnother 8,125 virus cases were recorded in the UK on Friday, according to official figures, and another 17 people died within 28 days of a positive test.\nAssociation of Directors of Public Health vice-president Jim McManus told Radio 4's Today programme the government had a \"fiendishly difficult decision\" to make on whether to ease restrictions further. \nHowever, he said if we \"invest that little bit of time to keep us going forwards, it will stop us going backwards\".\n\"If you get enough people infected, you will get a rise in hospitalisations,\" he said.\nHe added that more people getting infected would allow more variants to develop, which could risk a variant developing that evades the vaccine completely.\n\"So actually, investing a bit of time is really important to enable the vaccine programme to finish and do its job.\"\nAsked about reports in the Times that the government was considering a four-week delay, he said that would be \"really welcome\".\nLatest government figures show that more than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.4% of the adult population.\nAsked about the government decision on 14 June, Mr Zahawi, the vaccines minister, told BBC Breakfast: \"We have to be really careful so that those hard won wars against the virus are not squandered.\" \nHe reiterated that the government would \"share the data on Monday\".\n\"We all know the virus hasn't gone away, it will attempt to mutate,\" he said. \"The Delta variant is more infectious and more severe for those it infects. So, we have to be really careful.\"\nMeanwhile, the latest R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, up from between 1 and 1.2 last week, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others.\nIf the R number is above 1.0, the number of cases is increasing.\nMr Zahawi said that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June.\nHe also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global vaccination effort.\nThe UK has pledged to start donating vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks, as part of 100 million surplus doses which will be delivered in the next year."

      "text": "The alliance between the US and the UK should be known as the \"indestructible relationship\", Boris Johnson has told the BBC after meeting US President Joe Biden for the first time.\nHe said he had \"terrific\" talks with Mr Biden, who has travelled to Cornwall for the G7 summit of world leaders. \nThe summit begins later, with vaccines and climate change on the agenda.\nMr Johnson insisted the US president had not rebuked him over post-Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, Mr Biden is said to have \"deep concern\" over the situation.\nThe prime minister was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, after meeting Mr Biden in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, on Thursday ahead of the G7 summit.\nThe summit will see the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK gathering in person for the first time since the pandemic.\nAhead of the meeting, Mr Johnson pledged the UK would donate more than 100 million vaccines to poorer countries in the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union.\nThe G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022.\nMr Johnson told the BBC the UK and US shared a belief in human rights, the rules-based international order and the transatlantic alliance.\nHe said he thought of the association as \"an indestructible relationship\" or the \"deep and meaningful relationship\".\n\"It's a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\nThe PM had previously let it be known that he preferred a new term for the so-called \"special relationship\" between the UK and US after decades of use.\nThe first real-life meeting between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden clearly went well. \nMr Johnson and his team believe chemistry between leaders matters, and that the simple fact of gathering in person sends an important message. \nBut the issues the prime minister wants to confront this week can't be solved by just bonhomie at the beach.\nRead Laura's blog\nOne area which could cause friction between the two men is the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit deal that prevents checks along the Irish border.\nMr Biden has previously warned that the new arrangements should not jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998 that helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\nAsked if Mr Biden had expressed his concerns, Mr Johnson said: \"No, the president didn't say anything of the kind.\" \nThe prime minister did suggest the way the EU was implementing the agreed arrangement was \"excessively burdensome\" and said while the UK, the US and the EU wanted to preserve the balance in Northern Ireland, a resolution to the issue was unlikely to be found in the coming days. \nHowever, he added that the different sides would be able to \"work it out\".\nThe arrangements were set down in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal, but the UK has since sought more flexibility.\nSpeaking on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the protocol was the \"only solution\" and should be implemented fully.\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"I think it's not serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December.\n\"We have a trade deal - it has been painfully discussed for years... if six months later, they say: 'What we negotiated with you, we don't know how to respect it', then that means that nothing is respectable anymore.\"\nMr Johnson also defended his decision to reduce overseas aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, despite a manifesto promise to maintain the higher level. \nEarlier in the week, Mr Johnson faced strong criticism from some of his own MPs, one of whom said the cuts would lead to \"hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths\".\nThe prime minister said his government's aid spending as a percentage of GDP exceeded the amount spent by the last two Labour prime ministers.\nHe argued the public understood the financial strain caused by the pandemic, adding: \"I think people in this country, in spite of the constant running down of this country's efforts are incredibly proud of what we're doing in spite of the difficulties that were facing.\" \nHe also pointed to the UK's commitment to donate 100 million surplus vaccine doses to poorer countries in the next year, as well as previous doses contributed to Covax - the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest nations.\n\"We will have a colossal sum of vaccines that we'll be distributing - the fight against Covid would not be possible without the UK's efforts on vaccines,\" he said.\nMr Johnson also said he had discussed the case of Harry Dunn with the US president and that Mr Biden was \"extremely sympathetic\" and \"actively engaged\".\nThe G7 brings together seven leading industrialised nations.\nThey will spend the day discussing issues including the pandemic before a reception attended by the Queen.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also take part in their first G7 events.\nPrince William and Catherine will join the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at the G7 leaders' reception.\nAfterwards, Prince Charles will host a reception for the G7 leaders and heads of the world's largest companies to discuss how the private sector can work with governments to tackle the climate emergency."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is considering delaying the lifting of England's remaining Covid restrictions by up to four weeks, sources have told the BBC.\nThe final stage of lifting lockdown, originally planned to take place no earlier than 21 June, would see all legal limits on social contact removed.\nIt comes amid growing concern over rapidly increasing cases and the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant.\nDowning Street sources emphasised that no final decision has been made yet.\nData is still being examined ahead of a final announcement scheduled for Monday, and a senior government source stressed the government was considering \"options - plural\" for step four of England's roadmap.\nPushing the date back would allow the vaccination programme to take greater effect, as the rollout moves through to younger age groups.\nThe Times and Sun newspapers first reported that ministers were considering the delay.\nIt comes as key figures from the UK's Covid vaccine programme were recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. \nThe last part of ending lockdown in England would see nightclubs reopen, and an end to restrictions on performances, weddings and other life events.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has faced mounting pressure to push back the 21 June date in recent days.\nThe British Medical Association has joined public health officials in calling for a delay.\nBMA council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: \"It's not just about the number of hospitalisations, but also the risk to the health of large numbers of younger people, who can suffer long-term symptoms.\"\nIt is often said the vaccination programme has broken the link between infections and hospitalisation. \nBut in truth it has just weakened it. During winter about one in 10 Covid infections went on to become a hospital admission. Now with admissions rising early data suggests it may be close to one in 20. \nIf that's right and the trajectory in terms of increasing infections continues we could see 2,000 admissions a day within two months. That's twice what the NHS would normally see for all types of respiratory infections in a bad winter. \nBut that's a lot of ifs - and the data on its own doesn't tell the full story. More admissions seem to be among younger people this time who are less sick. \nThat makes sense as very low numbers of the double-jabbed are ending up in hospital. \nThere's a lot of uncertainty. In a few weeks scientists will be able to give ministers a clearer idea of the cost of a full unlock so it can be balanced against the benefits. What's more, the number of vaccinations done would be higher, providing even more protection. \nFollowing reports in the Times that some restrictions, such as the 30-person limit on weddings, could still be eased on 21 June, sources said various options are being considered.\nThe government said in February that England's restrictions would only be lifted if:\nThe Delta variant first identified in India now accounts for nine in 10 coronavirus cases in the UK.\nIt is roughly 60% more transmissible than the Alpha - or Kent - variant, Public Health England data suggests.\nThe analysis also found people infected by the Delta variant are two times more likely to end up in hospital than those with Alpha.\nHowever, the data suggests nearly two-thirds of people infected with the Delta variant have not had a single dose of a Covid vaccine. Officials stress that two doses of the vaccine provide significantly more protection than one.\nAt the current rate of growth, as estimated on Thursday, the UK will reach 15,000 cases a day by 21 June and January levels of infections by late July - that is without any further relaxation of rules.\nDr Mike Tildesley, reader in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group of Sage, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the key thing was to look at the link between cases and hospital admissions.\n\"We are starting to see perhaps early signals that hospital admissions are going up but it's still unclear,\" he said. \nHe added that even with a delay there would be a wave of cases and hospital admissions, and the government would have to weigh that up against the benefits of unlocking. \nPeter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said \"on balance\" he would consider vaccinating children - with newer variants seemingly spreading more among younger age groups than the Wuhan variant.\nHe told the Today programme new evidence on safety of the vaccination in children suggested they were \"pretty safe\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said any delay to ending lockdown would be \"a huge blow for many families and businesses across the country\".\nThe Labour MP accused the government of continuing with \"a reckless border policy that allowed the Delta variant to reach the UK and spread\" despite warnings from scientists.\nOn Friday vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was important to take a careful approach, adding: \"We don't want to squander those hard-fought gains that we have made through the vaccination programme.\"\nAnother 8,125 virus cases were recorded in the UK on Friday, according to official figures, and another 17 people died within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.4% of the adult population.\nThe R number in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others.\nThe easing of restrictions is happening at different speeds across the other nations of the UK with 21 June being given as an \"indicative date\" for a number of changes in Northern Ireland, including 10 people from two households being allowed to meet in private homes, up to 15 people being able to meet outdoors in a garden and theatres and concerts able to restart.\nLockdown measures in Wales will be reviewed on 21 June, while the whole of Scotland is due to move to level zero on 28 June - but the prevalence of the Delta variant may delay that."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has urged fellow world leaders to \"build back better\" after the Covid pandemic at this week's G7 summit in Cornwall.\nThe UK prime minister said it was vital to learn from the \"mistakes\" of the 2008 financial crisis and tackle the \"scar\" of inequality.\nAfter a day of talks at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay, leaders have joined the Queen for a dinner nearby.\nThe distribution of Covid vaccines is also high on the summit agenda.\nEarlier, the leaders posed for a group photo with the Queen, where the monarch was heard to joke: \"Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?\"\nThe leaders around the Queen laughed, and Mr Johnson replied emphatically: \"Yes.\"\nThe prime minister added: \"We have been enjoying ourselves - in spite of appearances.\"\nUS President Joe Biden is among those being hosted by Mr Johnson for the three-day meeting, as well the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada.\nIt is the first face-to-face summit of the G7 - representing most of the world's biggest economies - since before the pandemic started early last year. \nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel are also attending.\nIn his opening remarks at the main round-table discussions, Mr Johnson said that, as the world recovered from the pandemic, it was important to \"level up across our societies\" and \"build back better\".\nHe added: \"I actually think that we have a huge opportunity to that because, as G7, we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world, a solution to the problems of climate change.\"\nThe prime minister also said it was \"vital that we don't repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis - the last great economic recession of 2008 - when the recovery was not uniform across all parts of society\".\nPoliticians are attending a Friday evening reception at the nearby Eden Project, attended by the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\nThe UK government announced it was giving \u00a3430m in aid to the Global Partnership for Education, to help the world's \"most vulnerable children\" get better schooling, with a \"particular\" focus on girls.\nIt was important for the world economy to rebuild in a \"more equal and... in a more gender-neutral and perhaps a more feminine way\" after the huge damage caused by coronavirus, Mr Johnson told his fellow leaders.\nAs camera crews and photographers left the meeting room at the Carbis Bay Hotel, he joked that what had been intended as a \"fireside chat\" had turned into a \"media circus\".\nTweeting a photograph of himself with some of the other European leaders sitting on a seaside terrace, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote: \"As always, the same union, the same determination to act, the same enthusiasm! The G7 can begin.\"\nAs G7 leaders got round the table and down to business Boris Johnson's opening remarks initially followed a familiar pattern as he talked about \"building back better\". \nBut he ended on a less familiar pledge to build back in a \"more gender-neutral\" and \"feminine\" way. \nSo what does that mean? \nDowning Street sources are pointing to the PM's education announcement. Mr Johnson, I'm told, wants to improve the prospects of girls around the world. \nWhile the prime minister's terminology may cause some to cringe a little (\"ugh, just ugh,\" remarked one senior Tory MP), the underlying aim might attract praise, even if the UK government is temporarily cutting its overseas aid budget overall.\nBut, more broadly, the prime minister is keen to insert his \"build back better\" domestic agenda into the international scene. \n\"Build back better\" also happens to be the name of Joe Biden's mammoth jobs and recovery plan.\nFor any G7 leader, the world stage is still a chance to reach the audience at home.  \nMr Johnson has pledged the UK will donate more than 100 million Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union.\nBut some charities and campaigners have criticised the scale of the UK's plan, under which 5 million doses will be given out by the end of September, with 25 million by the end of 2021 and the rest provided during 2022. \nLis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was \"not happening anywhere near fast enough\", and called on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away.\nAnd US pop star Selena Gomez told her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that the promise to deliver 5 million vaccines by the end of September was \"too little too late\".\nMs Gomez was among a number of celebrities who took part in a concert aimed at increasing access to Covid vaccines in April. Mr Biden also appeared at the event, as did Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\nThe G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022.\nThe World Health Organization estimates 11 billion doses will be needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly affected.\nHundreds of people joined a march in St Ives, just along the coast from Carbis Bay, urging leaders to \"address the climate and ecological emergency\".\nThree people were arrested a few miles away from the summit venue earlier on suspicion of possession of an article with intent to commit criminal damage, and four were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance."

      "text": "World leaders are gathering in the Cornish resort of Carbis Bay, for face-to-face meetings at the summit of G7 nations.\nAmong them are Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and President Biden, who is making his first foreign visit since taking office.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. \nRussia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014 for its takeover of Crimea.\nChina has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's biggest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are.\nRepresentatives from the European Union are present while India, South Korea and Australia have also been invited this year.\nThe G7's Cornwall meeting takes place from Friday 11 to Sunday 13 June.\nThe UK is holding the G7 presidency for 2021 so this is where the summit is taking place. \nThe meeting is taking place at the Carbis Bay Hotel near St Ives in Cornwall.\nThe region is seen as central to the UK's green technology sector. Showing off the country's green credentials is important to the government ahead of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November. \nIt is not the first time the world leaders have met in a beach resort. The last G7 summit, in 2019, was held in the French seaside town of Biarritz.\nDay-to-day life for locals and tourists in Cornwall is affected, including road and path closures.\nIn some areas of St Ives, residents have to provide proof of address in order to access their homes. \nThe UK government said it was important for world leaders to meet in person and regular Covid testing would take place.\nThroughout the year ministers and officials from the member countries hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events.\nAhead of this year's summit, the G7 finance ministers agreed to make multinational companies pay more tax.\nThe main event is when the G7 leaders come together to talk about the biggest issues of the day.\nThe agenda starts with a dinner at the Eden Project on Friday night, attended by the Queen and members of the Royal Family.\nThe main topic of conversation for the rest of the summit is Covid recovery, including \"a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics\".\nThe agenda also includes climate change and trade.\nBoris Johnson held talks with President Biden on Thursday afternoon. They covered topics including the President's concerns over the peace in Northern Ireland.\nMost of the conversations take place behind closed doors, but there are set-piece moments on camera - including the obligatory leaders' photo.\nAt the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document called a communique. This outlines what has been agreed by the leaders.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a press conference on Sunday.\nProtesting and policing are both more difficult this year because of Covid restrictions.\nMore than 5,000 extra officers - on top of 1,500 from Devon and Cornwall - will police the summit.\nA cruise ship has docked in nearby Falmouth to accommodate all the extra security officers.\nDemonstrators have been told they can gather in four approved protesting sites, including one in Exeter - more than 100 miles away.\nPolice have said they are \"not na\u00efve enough to expect that every protest will take place solely in those four sites\".\nClimate activist group Extinction Rebellion planned a number of demonstrations, including a march from Plymouth to Carbis Bay.\nIt can't pass any laws because it is made up of separate nations with their own democratic processes.\nHowever, some decisions can have global effects.\nFor example, the G7 played crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002.\nHowever, the G7 has been criticised as being an \"outdated group of countries\", partly because it does not include two of the largest countries in the world - India and China.

      "tags": "GDP,Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK economy grew 2.3% in April, its fastest monthly growth since July last year.\nShoppers spent more on the High Street as non-essential shops reopened, and people bought more cars and caravans.\nThere was also more spending in pubs, cafes and restaurants as restrictions eased the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nDespite the surge in activity, the UK economy is still 3.7% below its pre-pandemic peak.\nConstruction fell in April, compared to strong growth the previous month, but the sector remains above its pre-pandemic peak.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said that the figures were \"a promising sign that our economy is beginning to recover\".\nMr Sunak said more than one million people had come off the government's furlough scheme in March and April as businesses reopened.\nJonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics said: \"Strong growth in retail spending, increased car and caravan purchases, schools being open for the full month, and the beginning of the reopening of hospitality all boosted the economy in April.\"\nYael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said shoppers flocked back to the High Street as households spent some of their savings on non-essential goods.\nSpending in non-essential shops drove much of the growth as customers were allowed back into stores from 12 April in England, with clothes stores seeing a boost of 69.4%.\nOverall growth in the services sector was 3.4%, although it remains 4.1% below pre-pandemic levels of February 2020.\nThis included restaurants, bars and cafes, where customers could eat and drink outdoors again, seeing a 39% rise in growth.\nPeople also used the ability to travel across the country again, with activity at caravan parks and holiday lets growing 68.6%, while hairdressers and other personal services grew 63.5%.\nA further relaxation of lockdown rules is planned for 21 June, which would let pubs, bars and restaurants increase the number of people allowed indoors.\nBut that is now looking increasingly unlikely which may put downward pressure on growth in the summer.\nRegardless of any pause in reopening, Ms Selfin said economic activity levels in May and June would not rise at the same rate as the April rebound.\nOne of the ways the pandemic has turned normal assumptions upside down is that a shrinking economy can be the successful outcome of deliberate government policy.\nThe government wanted to suppress economic activity to combat the virus, the public largely abided by the restrictions, and the economy shrank.\nSimilarly when you ease restrictions, and that suppressed activity comes back, leading to the sort of growth in a month that you're more normally see in a year, it's a deliberate and predictable outcome of policy rather than a stellar economic performance. \nThe economy has been growing now since January. But the \"bounceback\" is slower than the 7.3% growth recorded in July 2020, when restrictions of much greater severity were being lifted.\nAnd we still have a steep hill to climb. At the end of the first quarter of the year our economy had taken the biggest knock of all the G20 economies, in stark contrast to the likes of Korea, Australia, India or Turkey, which had already recovered beyond pre-pandemic levels. \nThe confident official prediction is that we're in for 7% growth this year which should boost that weak international performance. Let's hope that confidence isn't misplaced. \nMiatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of UK think tank New Economics Foundation, told the BBC the figures were in line with what was expected \"which is a big bounce as the restrictions were eased and the economy starts going back to normal\".\n\"But underneath this is probably going to be a story of two halves - the GDP numbers tell us the economy is recovering, but it's likely to be uneven, with the bounceback driven by parts of the economy that have essentially been insulated from the worst parts of the pandemic, and other parts of the economy - those with no work, or small businesses - really, really struggling, particularly as the government starts removing some [support] going into the autumn.\"\nSeparately, there is continued friction in trade with EU due to post-Brexit restrictions, although less than at the start of the year.\nMr Athow from the ONS said: \"Exports of goods have now, broadly, recovered from the disruptions seen at the beginning of the year. However, imports of goods from the EU are still significantly down on 2020 levels\".\nCompared with three years ago - the last time trade was unaffected by either Covid or concerns of a disruptive Brexit - British goods exports to the EU this April were 7.1% lower and imports from the EU were 15.3% lower.\nExports to the EU were also below their average for 2019.\n\"That is a disappointing performance, given the boom in global trade flows; UK exporters have lost market share,\" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\nTotal imports of goods excluding precious metals in April rose 3.9% or \u00a31.4bn, while exports fell slightly."

      "tags": "Xinjiang,Human rights,China",
      "text": "The human rights organisation Amnesty International has said China is committing crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, the north-western region that is home to the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.\nIn a report published on Thursday, Amnesty called on the UN to investigate, saying China had subjected Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims to mass detention, surveillance, and torture.\nAgn\u00e8s Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, accused Chinese authorities of creating \"a dystopian hellscape on a staggering scale\".\n\"It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive numbers of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus,\" Ms Callamard said.\nShe also accused the UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres of \"failing to act according to his mandate\".  \nMr Guterres \"has not denounced the situation, he has not called for an international investigation\", Ms Callamard told the BBC. \"It is incumbent on him to protect the values upon which the United Nations has been founded, and certainly not to stay silent in front of crimes against humanity,\" she said.\nIn a 160-page report based on interviews with 55 former detainees, Amnesty said there was evidence the Chinese state had committed \"at least the following crimes against humanity: imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; torture; and persecution.\"\nThe report follows a similar set of findings by Human Rights Watch, which said in an April report that it believed the Chinese government was responsible for crimes against humanity.\nChina has been accused by some Western nations and rights groups of pursuing a genocide against the Turkic ethnic groups in Xinjiang - though there is dispute over whether the state's actions constitute a genocide.\nThe author of the Amnesty report, Jonathan Loeb, said at press conference on Thursday that the organisation's research \"did not reveal that all the evidence of the crime of genocide had occurred\" but that it had so far \"only scratched the surface\".\nChina routinely denies all accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\nExperts generally agree that China has detained as many as a million Uyghurs and other Muslims and imprisoned hundreds of thousands more in its crackdown in Xinjiang, which began in 2017.\nThere have been widespread reports of physical and psychological torture inside prisons and detention camps in the region.\nChina has also been accused of using forced sterilisation, abortion, and population transfer to reduce birth rates and population density, and of targeting religious leaders to break religious and cultural traditions.\nChina denies those accusations, and says its camps in Xinjiang are voluntary vocational and de-radicalisation programmes for combating terrorism in the region.\nIn its report, Amnesty said counter-terrorism could not reasonably account for mass detention, and that the Chinese government's actions showed a \"clear intent to target parts of Xinjiang's population collectively on the basis of religion and ethnicity and to use severe violence and intimidation to root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices\".\nThe organisation said it believed those taken to the network of camps in Xinjiang were \"subjected to a ceaseless indoctrination campaign as well as physical and psychological torture\".\nThose torture methods, according to the report, included \"beatings, electric shocks, stress positions, the unlawful use of restraints (including being locked in a tiger chair), sleep deprivation, being hung from a wall, being subjected to extremely cold temperatures, and solitary confinement\".\nThe \"tiger chair\" - the existence of which has been reported elsewhere - is said to be a steel chair with leg irons and handcuffs designed to shackle the body in place. Several former detainees told Amnesty they were forced to watch others locked immobile in the tiger chair for hours or even days at a time. \nAmnesty also said that the camp system in Xinjiang appeared to be \"operating outside the scope of the Chinese criminal justice system or other known domestic law\", and that there was evidence detainees had been transferred from camps to prisons.\nThough many of the findings have been previously reported, Amnesty's investigation is likely to add to international pressure on China. The US state department has previously described China's actions in Xinjiang as a genocide, and the parliaments of the UK, Canada, Netherlands and Lithuania have passed resolutions making the same declaration.\nIn March, the EU, US, UK and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over the alleged abuses. China responded by imposing retaliatory sanctions on lawmakers, researchers and institutions.\nThe possibility of China being investigated by an international legal body is complicated by the fact that China is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court (ICC) - putting it outside the court's jurisdiction - and it has veto power over cases taken up by the International Court of Justice. The ICC announced in December it would not pursue a case.\nAn independent series of hearings was held in London last week, led by the prominent British barrister Sir Geoffrey Nice, aiming to assess the allegations of genocide."

      "title": "G7 summit: Why does it matter?",
      "text": "Do summits like this matter? \"Occasionally!\" comes the answer from a former government insider who worked for years at the very top. \nThey warn that global get-togethers - however glamorous the location, however acute any particular political emergency, however good the freebies for the thousands of attendees - can descend into 'waffelage'. \nAs the most powerful elected people in the world prepare to occupy a tiny Cornish bay for a few days, will this be an occasion that makes a difference to any of our lives or will it be waffle in the end? \nA senior diplomat closely involved in the preparation is confident, \"this will be very meaningful.\"\nIt is the first time the new American president will have met the relatively new British prime minister in person - a big moment by any measure. \nAnd it's the first time that the leaders of the world's biggest democracies have gathered like this since their countries were hit by a genuine emergency - Covid. \nThis current cast of leaders, particularly with a new boss in the White House, has given the impression in the run up to this meeting that they want genuinely to work together as the pandemic, while still with us, begins to fade. \nThe next few days will show whether they really mean it or not.  \nEven in the age of video calls and instant messages pinging their way around the world, summits do matter, because leaders and their officials can talk face to face. \nReal business can get done during \"the hallway conversations, the drinks at the bar\", the diplomat says.  \nHuge public attention puts the pressure on, and the moment where they all wave goodbye and climb back into their limos or helicopters provides a deadline to decide.   \nWithout doubt, real life contact makes a difference to what is decided. \nOne former senior figure in Theresa May's administration recalls a moment of jeopardy at a summit with President Trump. \nHe was planning to leave early, without signing up to the form of words that the other nations wanted. \nThe former official told me he was ushered into what was described as a \"secure broom cupboard\" with the then Australian leader, Malcolm Turnbull and the French President, Emmanuel Macron. \nIt's said they remained locked in argument in the tiny room, until Mr Trump agreed. \nAt a different G7 meeting in 2018, again the other nations were struggling to get Mr Trump and his officials to agree on the principles the others wanted to publish. \nThe dispute was over if and how the final document would refer to the \"international rules based order\" - the loose jargon for how democracies agree to behave and work with each other through shared institutions like the UN. \nWithout a specific definition of what the \"rules based order\" really meant though, the US was reluctant.  \nSo a small group of leaders themselves and a few key officials haggled face-to-face with the president and his powerful adviser, John Bolton, outside the formal meetings to do a deal. \nThe compromise was that the document would refer to \"a\" rules based order, not \"the\" when referring to the \"international rules based order\". \nAt a summit, leaders of the free world, and a few of their close aides, spent precious time arguing over the use of the definite or indefinite article...\nAnd some of the broader tensions during that meeting were captured in a classic photograph.\nSummits are the product of months and months of work by the hosts, and are carefully planned to within an inch of their lives and are huge opportunities for countries to show off. \nCovering the meetings over the years I've witnessed astonishing firework displays in China, the Argentine first lady hosting an elaborate tea party for leaders' spouses where even the air kissing seemed to be choreographed, parades, concerts, and plenty of the events themselves that are designed to show the leaders' interactions to the world. \nSummits have their own language too - the 'family photos' - the moments where the leaders have to take pre-appointed places for official snaps to be taken. \nThe 'bilats' or 'trilats' - one-to-one, or one-to-two meetings where the bond, or lack of, between the politicians is so blindingly obvious. \nThe 'communique' - the final document that leaders sign up to that's published at the end; prepared for months in advance by the 'sherpas', senior officials for each country, but the final version agreed only by the leaders themselves at the last minute. \nBut when the most senior politicians in the world and their most senior staff are in essence locked down together for a few days it is those unscripted moments that stick in the mind. \nBumping into a European prime minister who was wandering around a corridor in Brussels, who seemed lost, but said yes to an interview then and there in the dingy basement, filmed on a phone - that made the news.\nOne very early morning in a hot, foreign clime when trying to get some sea air to wake up after only a couple of hours of sleep, I encountered a very prominent official on the beach who rather mysteriously had company at that time of day. \nOne of their colleagues, seconds later, came leaping out of the sea having been confronted by some jellyfish - ending the need for a longer, awkward conversation. \nWhen a tense European summit dragged on with David Cameron, while we hacks were still hanging around inside waiting for news, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had had enough and popped out with her team for chips. \nAnd at the prime minister's own first summit in charge in Biarritz he went for his own swim off the French Atlantic coast. \nOf course, Boris Johnson being Boris Johnson, he didn't keep it to himself, but in classic style he used his swim out to a large rock as a metaphor for supporters for his hoped for heroics on Brexit.\nOne diplomat expressed concern at the notion of the leaders taking a dip this time round worrying about the all important 'optics'.  \nBut alongside the very serious hoped for progress on vaccines, on Covid recovery, on the climate, on reaffirming the links between the most powerful democracies in the world after the Trump Presidency, the events that have not been planned might be the ones that stay in the mind. \nThe next few days will also see the first official public engagements of the new Mrs Carrie Johnson. \nLike it or not, always nicknamed the \"leaders' wives\" summit, the \"spousal programme\" as it's officially termed is a universe all of its own. \nThis time, without question, this G7 should be an occasion that matters, for the serious discussions that are due to take place. \nThe government hopes for strong confirmation of the relationship between the UK and the US, commitments to help get vaccines to the developing world, and for progress on climate change. \nThey plan also for convincing conversations with the other nations that have been invited, what the prime minister is terming the \"football team\" - the \"D 11\" - the G7 plus India (attending virtually), South Korea, South Africa and Australia too, forging links ever more important among democracies in the face of growing influence from China. \nBut this summit will also matter for the glimpses of our leaders, and snapshots of the vital relationships they forge.

      "text": "Boris Johnson at the G7 summit has pledged \u00a3430m to improve education in some of the world's poorest countries - with girls' education a priority.\nThe prime minister said it was a source of \"international shame\" that so many girls in poorer countries were missing out on access to school.\nWith an education, these children could have been \"titans of industry or scientific pioneers\", he said.\nBut aid agencies called for a reversal of cuts to the UK's aid budget.\n\"The best way we can lift countries out of poverty and lead a global recovery is by investing in education and particularly girls' education,\" the prime minister told world leaders gathered in Cornwall.\nThe prime minister has made girls' education a flagship issue of the G7 - and the summit will approve plans to get 40 million more girls into school, in countries where girls might either be kept out of school or drop out early.\nThe \u00a3430m over five years will be the UK's biggest amount contributed to the Global Partnership for Education, an international co-ordinating body which wants to raise $5bn (\u00a33.5bn) at an education summit next month, for projects in 90 countries.\nLis Wallace of the anti-poverty charity, One, said the destructive impact of the pandemic on education in poorer countries had been \"staggering\" and a \"silent emergency\".\nBut she said the amount offered so far \"falls short\" of what is needed - and warned the cut to international aid risked \"undermining these efforts\".\nThe funding announcement was \"a good start\" but there still needed to be a reversal of \"shameful cuts to overseas aid\", said Rose Caldwell, chief executive of Plan International UK.\nMark Sheard, chief executive  of World Vision UK, said the funding announced was not enough after the \"drastic cuts\" to the aid budget.\nHelen Grant, the prime minister's special envoy for girls' education, said the ambition to get 12 years of quality education for every girl would be a \"game changer\".\n\"If you want to change the world for the better, girls' education has to be the place to start,\" she told the BBC.\nBetter education would mean an upward cycle of improvement in health and economic chances for girls and their families, and would reduce the risk of early marriage and poverty, she said.\n\"An example would be that a child with a mother who can read is 50% more likely to live beyond the age of five,\" she said.\nMrs Grant said it was in the UK's own interests not to \"pull up the drawbridge on some of the most vulnerable, marginalised and needy people\".\nImproving education in developing countries, particularly in Africa, would create a \"better, safer, fairer and more prosperous world - which is good for all of us\".\nThe government has faced a rebellion, including from some of its own MPs, over the reduction in the international aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income.\nThe chair of the international development select committee said it was \"ridiculous that the government trumpets its commitment to girls' education\" while cutting aid.\nMrs Grant said the \"seismic impact of the pandemic\" meant taking \"tough choices\" - including a \"temporary reduction in aid\".\n\"We are hoping that it will return to 0.7% when fiscal conditions allow.\"\nDescribing how education could be such a crossroads in young lives, Mrs Grant said she'd spoken in a school in Uganda to a \"clever little girl, embracing everything, full of life\".\nThe girl told her she wanted to become a doctor - but without access to school she would have a life of \"collecting wood, collecting water, making the food\".\n\"That drives us all on,\" she said.\nThe UK Bangladesh Education Trust (UKBET) is a UK charity working with child domestic workers in Bangladesh. \nIt pays for local teachers to visit girls like Sayeeda, 9, who works as a servant to earn money for her family, or 16-year-old Lalit, who has now learned to write her own name, having never gone to school. \nIn March 2020, UKBET began applying for UK funding of \u00a350,000 over two years to continue with and expand its programme. But in April of this year the charity was told the fund it had applied to had been withdrawn due to the government's aid cuts.  \nReacting to news of the new funding, announced at the G7,, UKBET's Annette Zara said she was \"I'm bewildered and infuriated\".  \n\"A month ago the government needed to save \u00a325,000 by cutting one of the few programmes bringing education to young girls enslaved in domestic work in Bangladesh. Yet today, they have found \u00a3400m at the back of the cupboard.\"\nAmong the beneficiaries of UK aid is Matandani school, near Zomba in Malawi, in southern Africa.\nTalking on Zoom, the head teacher Givemore Chipanga said pupils might walk 5km or 6km to school each morning - and the younger pupils were in classes of more than 180 children.\nThe school, which has been proud of its efforts to get solar power and piped water, has been trying to recover from the impact of the pandemic.\nMr Chipanga said he was worried that the disruption would push learners permanently out of education - such as girls going into an early marriage.\nThe rural school is part of the Unlocking Talent educational technology project, supported by Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), which uses tablet computers to help teachers track the progress of pupils in such large classes.\nThe project, backed by the University of Nottingham and the charity onebillion, has particularly helped girls, said the head teacher.\nMr Chipanga said supporting girls' education was vital for countries such as Malawi - with benefits to health and the economy.\n\"You have to fill that gender gap,\" he said.\n\"Once a girl is educated, her family will be educated, society will be assisted,\" said the head teacher. \"You educate the nation.\""

      "title": "US-UK special relationship: How goes it under Biden and Johnson?",
      "tags": "US election 2020,Boris Johnson,Brexit,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Boris Johnson and Joe Biden will meet near the cliff tops overlooking the magnificent Carbis Bay in Cornwall, the waves from the Atlantic crashing below.\nIt won't have the bodice-ripping tension and tempestuousness of an encounter between Ross Poldark and Demelza - until now the most famous pairing from these parts thanks to the BBC hit drama - but this is an important relationship to watch as it develops.\nThe reasons why it might get off to a horrible start are all too easy to enumerate. Biden firmly supported Britain remaining in the EU; Johnson was the leading architect of Brexit. \nBiden is perhaps the most \"Irish\" (I put it in inverted commas because a lot of Americans in public life like to play up their Irish roots - though Biden's are very clear) of recent US presidents, and the Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct for him - and so he will make clear to his British host there can be no tinkering with the Northern Ireland protocol if it puts that long-fought-over agreement in jeopardy. \nBoris Johnson clearly wants to get out of the binding agreement - freely signed by the British to get Brexit done - that in effect puts a trade barrier down the Irish Sea between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. \nIn a pre-visit interview, Joe Biden's national security adviser told me that Britain should not underestimate the strength of Biden's feelings on this subject.\nAnd then there is the back story of the two men - Boris Johnson was seen by many in the US as Britain's Donald Trump (certainly by Donald Trump himself) - a bit chaotic, populist, unpredictable, a rabble rouser. And in return Boris Johnson was lavish in his praise of the former business tycoon occupying the White House - he was Making America Great Again said the British PM; he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in North Korea.\nAnd no-one would say that Joe Biden is cut from the same privileged cloth as Boris Johnson. Somehow I can't quite imagine the young working class Joe from Scranton, Pennsylvania, in Bullingdon Club white tie. Indeed Biden went as far as describing Johnson as a \"physical and emotional clone\" of Donald Trump.\nBut equally, if you delve back into the manila folder of yellowing newspaper cuttings - or just used your search engine - you will find plenty of disobliging comments from BoJo from when he was mayor of London, talking about Trump's \"stupefying ignorance\". \nAll of which leads to an obvious point. That was then. Now is now.\nIf we're talking of presidents and PMs not being cut from the same cloth, you would have to say that David Cameron and Barack Obama were hardly obvious soulmates, yet they forged a close working relationship. To Cameron's credit - he didn't obsess and fret about the special relationship in the way that some others have done. Remember Gordon Brown chasing Barack Obama through a kitchen at the UN so desperate was he to have a face to face with the American president?\nIf you're the British prime minister you make it your business to get on with whoever the elected US president of the day is. In the days after the 2020 presidential election when Donald Trump was insisting it was all a fraud and he would overturn the result (actually, come to think of it, seven months on he is still saying the same thing), the Johnson government was very speedy to note that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor and was duly congratulated by the British. Some countries havered on doing the same, fearful of incurring the wrath of Donald Trump. \nOn some of the biggest ticket items facing the world, Biden and Johnson are completely aligned. Perhaps most notably, on climate change and the upcoming COP26 UN climate change conference being hosted in Glasgow in November - but also on national security issues, defence co-operation and intelligence sharing, Britain and the US are very closely aligned.\nGo back in history, and few would have imagined that after the apparent bromance between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, with all their windy rhetoric about The Third Way (I really can't decide whether the idea deserves capital letters or not - I'll leave them there for now), that the British PM would have transitioned so effortlessly into forging such a close relationship with George W Bush - of course many then criticised Blair for becoming too close to Bill Clinton's successor. \nI think the only relationship where there was lasting damage came when Bill Clinton was elected president and John Major was prime minister. Major's efforts to help George HW Bush win re-election by allowing the Home Office to look into whether there was any \"dirt\" on Bill Clinton from when he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford was a big mistake, and probably had a lasting impact.\nIt's hard to believe that Biden and Johnson will be a recreation of the Thatcher and Reagan relationship - or going back further, Churchill and FDR - Churchill during the terrifying blitz in 1940 would talk about courting and cultivating the US leader, endlessly finding ways to capture his attention - and critically support - to bring the US into the Second World War.\nThe other week on our podcast Americast, I spoke to Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's former deputy national security adviser, and joked about the special relationship. Remember this is something that the British political class talk much more about than the Americans. \nBut Rhodes made the point that there is such a commonality of interest, so many shared values, that when you sit down with the British to discuss major issues, you invariably find yourself starting from the same point. How you get to the end point might differ, but being of like mind is a good start for the relationship between Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. On most things they are.\nAnd with Britain forging a post-Brexit future that is critically important.\nOne thing the two men do have in common is that both men are Roman Catholics - though as one wag noted drily - one is a practising Roman Catholic; the other is in need of a lot more practice."

      "text": "Kent County Council says it will not be taking on any unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Monday as it has reached \"the limit of safe capacity\".  \nThe council has threatened legal action against the Home Secretary over the \"extreme pressure\" on its services. \nMore than 400 such children are in the care of the council. The government's recommended maximum number is 231.\nThe Home Office on Thursday announced measures encouraging other local authorities to take on child migrants.\nKent County Council (KCC) had to take similar action in August. \nChildren arriving next week will be taken by Border Force to the Kent Intake Unit at Dover. \nThey would usually then be passed on to KCC, but now they will now remain the responsibility of the Home Office, who will have to find places for them with other local authorities, KCC said.\nBy Mark Easton, Home Editor, BBC News\nFor a Conservative council to threaten a Conservative Home Secretary with legal action is indicative of the frustration and anger felt in Kent at the unfolding crisis hitting the county for the second time in ten months.\nUnless another council agrees to help, Kent County Council has a legal duty to take care of any unaccompanied child migrant that arrives among the thousands of asylum seekers who turn up on its coast each year.\nBut Kent's leaders say the current voluntary transfer scheme is not good enough, and despite extra government cash and a new rota system, it is inevitable that highly vulnerable children at the end of a long and traumatic journey will be left in a psychologically-damaging limbo.  \nThis Tory authority appears determined to follow through on its threat to take the Home Secretary to court unless she forces other local authorities to share the burden. \nPriti Patel, however, is reluctant to oblige councils to take responsibility for child asylum-seekers.\nCouncil leader Roger Gough said: \"I am profoundly saddened to be in this unthinkable position once again in such a short period of time.\n\"Despite warnings, and continued dialogue with government, Kent's UASC [unaccompanied asylum-seeking children] support resources are again significantly overwhelmed.\"\nMr Gough said no further arrivals could be accepted until \"sufficient transfers have been made outside of Kent bringing our numbers back to safe levels\".\nHe said it was \"a small problem for the nation to resolve but a huge and unreasonable responsibility for Kent\".\nKCC has taken its first steps in legal action against Home Secretary Priti Patel and wants her to make other councils take \"their fair share\". Without any substantive response to its proposals by 17 June, KCC said it would issue a claim for judicial review.\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"The Home Office is grateful for the role KCC has played in supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, and we have provided them with substantial operational support, including transferring those in need of support to other local authorities in the UK.\n\"We recently announced vital updates to the National Transfer Scheme to alleviate pressures on certain areas and continue to work closely across Government on provision for unaccompanied minors.\"\nSo far this year at least 4,449 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats, with 925 people arriving in Dover in the first 10 days of June.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "Campaigner Noel Conway, who brought a legal challenge against the ban on assisted dying in the UK, has died at the age of 71.\nMr Conway, of Shropshire, had motor neurone disease and only had movement in his right hand, head and neck.\nHe took his campaign to the Supreme Court, arguing for his right to die, but lost the appeal in 2018.\nHis wife Carol said he had died at home on Wednesday after deciding with his family to remove his ventilator.\nShe said the local hospice team and ventilation nurses had \"ensured Noel had a painless and dignified death, demonstrating empathy and concern for us all\". \n\"Noel was in control, which was so important,\" Mrs Conway said. \n\"Ultimately, Noel wanted the choice of an assisted death and I hope his campaigning will bring this option closer to becoming a reality for other terminally ill people in this country.\"\nHe composed a statement in which he said his quality of life \"has dipped into the negative\".\nHe asked Dignity in Dying, which supported his legal action, to release his final words after his death.\n\"My voice has depleted to the extent that many people cannot now tell what I say and my eyesight recently deteriorated,\" he wrote.\n\"I'm already a paraplegic and I cannot use my hands or fingers but I am aware that my neck muscles are weakening as are my mouth and speech muscles.\n\"I recognise that the time has come to take the decision now to do something about this.\n\"I am not leaving it until I'm completely bed-ridden and unable to communicate at all.\"\nHe wrote how he felt he had \"no alternative to ending my life without pain and suffering and without compromising others\".\n\"This is not something I would have chosen.\"\nMr Conway, a former lecturer, argued the current law is an unjustifiable interference with the right to respect for private life under the European Convention on Human Rights.\nHowever, in September 2018 his legal battle for reform ended when the Supreme Court rejected his bid to appeal against a High Court ruling that refused him the option of assisted dying.\nHe wanted a doctor to be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose when his health deteriorated, but the current law means any doctor who did so risked 14 years in prison.\nAfter the ruling, he said his remaining options were to \"effectively suffocate\" by removing his ventilator, or spend thousands travelling to the Dignitas assisted dying clinic in Switzerland to end his life and have his family risk prosecution. \nMrs Conway said her husband had been left with \"considerable anxiety\" when he had decided to remove his ventilator on Wednesday due to \"the uncertainty over how long this would take for Noel and what he might experience\". \nIn his statement, Mr Conway said he understood it could take him up to eight hours to die after removing his ventilator.\nMr Conway was totally dependent on it to breathe and Dignity in Dying released a statement to say he had taken it off to hasten his death.\nThe campaign group paid tribute to Mr Conway, saying: \"Noel will be remembered as a loving husband, father, grandfather, friend, lecturer, mentor and for playing an instrumental role in bringing us closer to having a safe, compassionate assisted dying law in this country.\" \nThe campaigner, who lived in Garmston, near Shrewsbury, spoke openly about how he felt \"entombed\" by his illness since his diagnosis in 2014 and could not accept the standard of living he expected at the end of his life.\nHis case was among several high profile attempts to challenge the UK's law on assisted dying, and divided opinion.\nCare Not Killing, which had opposed Mr Conway's appeal, argued his case failed to give enough weight to \"the sanctity of life\" and that a complete ban on assisted suicide and euthanasia was the safest law.\nDetails of organisations which offer advice and support with MND are available via the BBC Action Line.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Colorado,Inverness,California",
      "text": "A rapist who tried to evade justice by fleeing Scotland then faking his own death at one of California's most dangerous beaches has been jailed for 15 years.\nKim Avis, a market trader from Inverness, was eventually tracked down more than 1,000 miles away in Colorado, then brought home to Scotland - where he was convicted of rape and sexual abuse offences committed in the Highlands.\nThe Scot had been on bail when he flew into Los Angeles International Airport on 16 February 2019, and was using the name Ken Gordon-Avis.\nNine days later, his son reported him missing at Monastery Beach, telling the local sheriff's office that his dad had gone for an evening swim.\nThe beach is near Carmel-by-the-Sea, a city of about 3,800 people on the Big Sur - a rugged and mountainous stretch of Californian coastline.\nMonastery Beach is renowned for its beautiful sand - and notorious for its water's dangerous strong undertow and treacherous high surf conditions.\nDeaths of swimmers and divers led to it being nicknamed Mortuary Beach.\nMary Schley, who has been a reporter on the Carmel Pine Cone newspaper for almost 23 years, said that nickname was \"well entrenched\".\n\"The beach is full of posted warnings,\" she said. \n\"Numerous people, including experienced divers, have drowned there.\"\nThe authorities were initially unaware of Avis' background and an extensive three-day search of the shore and sea was carried out.\nHowever, from the start some things did not seem quite right.\n\"The water is very cold, so it's unusual for someone to go swimming only in a pair of shorts in the evening in late February, when it's nearing dark, as Avis was said to have done,\" said Ms Schley.\n\"The water that night was unusually flat and calm, and therefore not nearly as dangerous as when the surf is high, and the weather was clear.\"\nThe search, which was co-ordinated by the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, included forestry and fire protection personnel, a dive team, a coastguard helicopter and a drone which swept the area.\nBut Commander Derrel Simpson said one of his officers, Sgt David Murray, felt something did not add up.\nAvis appeared to have taken all his personal belongings - including his passport - with him on the swim.\nThe sheriff's office was also told that the father and son had been staying in hotels and been camping, but they had no equipment for a hiking trip.\nSgt Murray found out that the hotel where Avis was said to have stayed had no record of him as a guest.\nWhen he contacted one of Avis' relatives in Scotland, he learned that the missing man was facing charges of sexual attacks against women and girls in the Highlands.\nCommander Simpson, a 30-year sheriff's office veteran, said: \"We have had a lot of deaths at Monastery Beach, but I can't think of anyone using it as a ploy before.\"\nThe investigation was turned over to the US Marshals Service, which has responsibility for catching wanted criminals.\nOver the next few months, Monterey sheriff's deputies worked with US Marshals, Interpol and the Scottish authorities to secure an arrest and extradition warrant for Avis.\nThey established that Avis had entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport, using a different name.\nIt also emerged that his bank account had been used in Colorado after his disappearance in California.\nCommander Simpson said the most valuable tip-off they received was that Avis had been seen driving a white Ford van in the Big Sur area.\nFive months after he disappeared, that piece of information helped US Marshals trace Avis in Colorado Springs - more than 1,300 miles (2,092km) away from where he was reported missing.\nThe following week, on 27 July 2019, he was arrested.\nCommander Simpson said bringing Avis to justice was a team effort.\n\"It was impressive how everyone played a part, including the Scottish authorities - and how the US Marshals tracked him half way across the country,\" he said.\nAvis was returned to Scotland, where he was held in prison until his trial.\nLast month, a jury at the High Court in Glasgow found the 57-year-old market trader guilty of raping three women.\nHe was also found guilty of attempting to rape one of them when she was 12, and guilty of sexually assaulting a girl when she was 11.\nHe was further convicted of failing to appear for the previous trial.\nIn total, Avis was found guilty of 14 charges from between 2006 and 2017. He had denied all the charges.\nOn Friday, Avis was jailed for 12 years for the sex crimes he committed in the Highlands, and three years for failing to appear in court.\nJudge Lord Sandison said Avis had been a well-known street trader in Inverness for many years, busking and selling jewellery from his market stall - and even receiving a good citizen award.\nBut the judge said there was another side to Avis, with a background report describing him as \"a controlling and dominant personality\".\nHe said Avis had manipulated, managed and coerced his victims.\nFraser Gibson, of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, said it had been a \"difficult and complex\" investigation.\nHe said: \"Kim Avis went to great lengths to evade justice for his crimes. \n\"Thanks to the efforts of police and prosecutors, working together with US law enforcement, he has been brought to justice and sentenced today.\"\nPolice Scotland praised his victims for the \"courage, strength and dignity\" they had shown throughout the investigation and court case."

      "tags": "Spotify,Streaming,Sony,Music",
      "text": "Sony Music has cancelled the debts of thousands of artists who signed to the record label before the year 2000.\nIt means that many will now, for the first time, earn money when their songs are streamed on services like Spotify and Amazon Music. \nSony said it could not name the eligible acts due to confidentiality agreements, but a source said it would \"include household names\".\nIt said some artists stood to receive \"many thousands of dollars per year\".\nMusicians typically take on debt when they first sign to a record label. They are given a lump sum, known as an advance, to pay for recording studios, video shoots, distribution and other expenses. The money is then paid back when they sell their music.\nHowever, many artists never earn enough to repay their advances, often because they get unfavourable royalty rates from their own record companies. Heritage black artists have been particularly affected.\nAnd until the debt to their label is repaid, those artists are not eligible to receive income from streaming, and other royalty payments.\nThat's how an act like TLC, who were signed to Sony subsidiary LaFace Records, ended up declaring bankruptcy in the 1990s. \nThe R&B stars declared debts of $3.5m, despite having one of the decade's best selling albums, CrazySexyCool.\nSony's announcement came in a letter to artists on Friday, a copy of which has been shared with the BBC.\n\"We are not modifying existing contracts, but choosing to pay through on existing unrecouped balances to increase the ability of those who qualify to receive more money from uses of their music,\" it said.\nIn other words, the debt hasn't been explicitly wiped out - but Sony will ignore it and pay royalties to affected acts, backdated to 1 January 2021.\nMusic industry lawyer Aurelia Butler-Ball said the scheme would \"unlock\" streaming revenues that artists were not previously entitled to, under contracts signed during the CD and cassette era.\n\"Many of the record deals [made] before 2000 didn't recognise that streaming platforms would ever exist,\" she said. \"Therefore, artists didn't have the right mechanisms in place to see those revenues.\"\nSony's initative comes amid mounting pressure on the record industry to be more transparent about the way it distributes money, particularly from streaming services.\nA parliamentary inquiry is currently looking into the streaming economy, prompted by the vocal #BrokenRecord campaign, which seeks to address the imbalance in how profits are shared between record labels, musicians and the streaming services themselves.\nGomez musician Tom Gray, who founded the campaign, said Sony's move was \"incredibly welcome\".\n\"From the perspective of somebody who's been running a campaign to try and get these companies to behave more ethically and transparently, it feels like a win,\" he told the BBC.\nButler-Ball, who is a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said the initiative was something musicians had been \"pushing for\" for some time, but that it was only when the public began to take notice of the #BrokenRecord and #FixStreaming campaigns that record companies felt they had to act.\n\"I think this is absolutely a sign of labels recognising that there is pressure coming from not only artists but fan bases, and it's increasingly being talked about publicly,\" she said.\nSony is not the first company to take such a step. Indie label Beggars Group, which is home to acts like Grimes, Jarvis Cocker and The xx, has previously written off unrecouped balances on older contracts. However, Sony is the only major label to do so.\nIts direct competitors, Universal and Warner Music, may feel they should follow suit - but Gray says they should go even further by fixing the low royalty rates given to artists in the 1960s and 70s.\n\"If that person's on a 5% royalty, they're not suddenly going to start earning lots of money,\" he said, referring to the new deal. \n\"If you look at what labels like BMG are doing now, where they're doing standard 30% deals [where artists gets 70% of the money], then Sony haven't even got to what 'good' looked like a decade ago.\"\nMeanwhile, Sony's move could enable heritage artists to sell their song catalogues to interested buyers - as Bob Dylan, Blondie and Barry Manilow have all recently done.\n\"There are plenty of funds out there looking to buy catalogues at multiple of 10 times and above [in exhange] for artist royalties,\" music consultant Alasiter Moughan told the BBC.  \n\"If an artist was unrecouped a potential buyer might want the artist to pay this balance back or not purchase the royalties at all, as no actual cash would be flowing through.  \n\"This change in policy from Sony could be significant for an artist in this position.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe UK will donate more than 100m surplus coronavirus vaccine doses to poorer countries in the next year, starting in the coming weeks, says Boris Johnson. The prime minister is urging fellow G7 leaders to make similar pledges, ahead of the summit in Cornwall. US President Joe Biden is promising 500 million Pfizer vaccine doses \"no strings attached\" to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. Campaigners say more needs to be done, quickly.\nThe UK economy grew 2.3% in April, its highest monthly rate since July last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says consumers bought more cars and increased spending both on the High Street and in pubs, cafes and restaurants. Despite the surge in activity, the UK economy is still 3.7% below its pre-pandemic peak.\nMonday was intended to be the moment when the government declared the pandemic was effectively over in England by giving a week's notice that all restrictions would end on 21 June. But that prospect looks increasingly unlikely following the rise of the Delta variant, says our health correspondent Nick Triggle. Read his analysis.\nPfizer vaccine supplies will be \"tight\" over the next few weeks and will restrict the vaccination programme, the Scottish health secretary has warned. Humza Yousaf has written to his UK government counterpart, Matt Hancock, to ask what can be done to increase supplies, in light of advice from scientists that people under 40 should be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine if one is available.\nWith people at 18 sites across the UK taking part in a booster-dose trial, volunteers in Wrexham have been among those getting a third Covid vaccine jab. Sue Cusack was among the first. \"I wasn't nervous, it was more exciting really,\" she tells us. \"It felt special to be part of the process which means that other people can have it in the future.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAs football's European Championships get under way, remind yourself of the rules on getting together with friends to watch the games.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The alliance between the US and the UK should be known as the \"indestructible relationship\", Boris Johnson has told the BBC after meeting US President Joe Biden for the first time.\nHe said he had \"terrific\" talks with Mr Biden, who has travelled to Cornwall for the G7 summit of world leaders. \nThe summit begins later, with vaccines and climate change on the agenda.\nMr Johnson insisted the US president had not rebuked him over post-Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, Mr Biden is said to have \"deep concern\" over the situation.\nThe prime minister was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, after meeting Mr Biden in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, on Thursday ahead of the G7 summit.\nThe summit will see the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK gathering in person for the first time since the pandemic.\nAhead of the meeting, Mr Johnson pledged the UK would donate more than 100 million vaccines to poorer countries in the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union.\nThe G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022.\nMr Johnson told the BBC the UK and US shared a belief in human rights, the rules-based international order and the transatlantic alliance.\nHe said he thought of the association as \"an indestructible relationship\" or the \"deep and meaningful relationship\".\n\"It's a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\nThe PM had previously let it be known that he preferred a new term for the so-called \"special relationship\" between the UK and US after decades of use.\nThe first real-life meeting between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden clearly went well. \nMr Johnson and his team believe chemistry between leaders matters, and that the simple fact of gathering in person sends an important message. \nBut the issues the prime minister wants to confront this week can't be solved by just bonhomie at the beach.\nRead Laura's blog\nOne area which could cause friction between the two men is the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit deal that prevents checks along the Irish border.\nMr Biden has previously warned that the new arrangements should not jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998 that helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\nAsked if Mr Biden had expressed his concerns, Mr Johnson said: \"No, the president didn't say anything of the kind.\" \nThe prime minister did suggest the way the EU was implementing the agreed arrangement was \"excessively burdensome\" and said while the UK, the US and the EU wanted to preserve the balance in Northern Ireland, a resolution to the issue was unlikely to be found in the coming days. \nHowever, he added that the different sides would be able to \"work it out\".\nThe arrangements were set down in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal, but the UK has since sought more flexibility.\nSpeaking on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the protocol was the \"only solution\" and should be implemented fully.\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"I think it's not serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December.\n\"We have a trade deal - it has been painfully discussed for years... if six months later, they say: 'What we negotiated with you, we don't know how to respect it', then that means that nothing is respectable anymore.\"\nMr Johnson also defended his decision to reduce overseas aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, despite a manifesto promise to maintain the higher level. \nEarlier in the week, Mr Johnson faced strong criticism from some of his own MPs, one of whom said the cuts would lead to \"hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths\".\nThe prime minister said his government's aid spending as a percentage of GDP exceeded the amount spent by the last two Labour prime ministers.\nHe argued the public understood the financial strain caused by the pandemic, adding: \"I think people in this country, in spite of the constant running down of this country's efforts are incredibly proud of what we're doing in spite of the difficulties that were facing.\" \nHe also pointed to the UK's commitment to donate 100 million surplus vaccine doses to poorer countries in the next year, as well as previous doses contributed to Covax - the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest nations.\n\"We will have a colossal sum of vaccines that we'll be distributing - the fight against Covid would not be possible without the UK's efforts on vaccines,\" he said.\nMr Johnson also said he had discussed the case of Harry Dunn with the US president and that Mr Biden was \"extremely sympathetic\" and \"actively engaged\".\nThe G7 brings together seven leading industrialised nations.\nThey will spend the day discussing issues including the pandemic before a reception attended by the Queen.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also take part in their first G7 events.\nPrince William and Catherine will join the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at the G7 leaders' reception.\nAfterwards, Prince Charles will host a reception for the G7 leaders and heads of the world's largest companies to discuss how the private sector can work with governments to tackle the climate emergency."

      "text": "Politicians from across the UK and Ireland have been discussing the Covid pandemic recovery at a meeting in County Fermanagh as part of the British-Irish Council.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster, who is from Fermanagh, said it was fitting to hold the meeting there as her time in office comes to end.\nShe is expected to step down as first minister at the beginning of next week.\nMrs Foster hosted the event with the Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nShe was given a round of applause at a press conference after she sang a few lines from the Frank Sinatra song That's Life when she was asked about her departure as first minsiter.\nQuizzed about the stability of Stormont after Mrs Foster steps down as expected next week, Ms O'Neill said Sinn F\u00e9in were determined \"to make power sharing work\".\nThe meeting was also attended by the Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin. \nHe paid tribute to Arlene Foster and said the political world always needed \"politicians of courage\". \nIt's Arlene Foster's swan song.\nThere was a doubt at one point whether she would still be around to host this event but everybody cooled their jets and she's still here, probably her last big gig.\nThe agenda today is supposed to be the relaxing of Covid restrictions, which still do affect this event. While the meeting is primarily non-virtual, there are still a couple of people who are not here and attending virtually.\nMiche\u00e1l Martin and Leo Varadkar are there, as is the new DUP leader Edwin Poots, who seems to favour Mr Martin's approach to the protocol and Brexit over Mr Varadkar's.\nThere are some interesting relationships to be worked on in the room today.\nThe first ministers of Wales and Scotland both attended the event virtually.\nGovernment representatives from the Isle Of Man, Jersey and Guernsey were also involved.\nThe event at the Lough Erne Golf resort is the 35th meeting of the British-Irish Council, which was set up under the Good Friday Agreement as part of efforts to boost and strengthen east-west relations. \nIt meets every six months.\nSDLP MLA Nichola Mallon said the meeting must be opportunity for facing down political challenges.\n\"My clear message will be that Northern Ireland isn't a bargaining chip nor is it acceptable that our businesses and communities are left with ongoing uncertainties,\" she said.\nCabinet Officer Minister Michael Gove said the meeting will be looking at \"what we can do collectively in recovering from the pandemic\".\n\"When we have NHS waiting lists in the UK the length that they are and we have lost learning for all of our children across the UK, that has to be the priority,\" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster.\nMr Gove said the UK government has been working with the EU to try and \"make sure the Northern Ireland Protocol works as it should when it was originally agreed\".\nHe said that if it is the case that Northern Ireland citizens \"feel the protocol is no longer in their interest it can be rejected a the ballot box\".\nMr Gove also paid tribute to Mrs Foster, saying that while her tenure as first minister was coming to an end \"her contribution to public life in Northern Ireland and across the UK, and perhaps beyond, has not ended\".\n\"I love Arlene, I think she's fantastic, I think she's a wonderful person, she's an open hearted, public spirited, problem solving, go-getting leader and she has been a great voice for Northern Ireland as first minster.\""

      "text": "Volunteers in Wrexham have been given a third Covid vaccine as part of a UK-wide trial.\nThey attended a special clinic in the town to receive their booster dose.\nWrexham is one of 18 sites across the UK to take part in the Cov-Boost study, with more than 2,800 volunteers required.\nThe trial will provide data on patients' immune response to a third dose ahead of a potential rollout later this year.\nIt is the pandemic's latest clinical study in Wales, where more than 45,000 people have volunteered to take part in various trials since March last year.\nThe trial will also assess acquired immunity against coronavirus variants, including the more transmissible Delta variant first identified in India.\nOrod Osanlou, principal investigator for the study, said: \"We now have vaccines that are safe and effective in preventing Covid-19.\"\n\"What we are now looking for with Cov-Boost is for a booster vaccine, and how this booster affects people's immune response and their protection against the virus. And, excitingly, Cov-Boost is the first study in the world that is looking at this.\"\nThe study will assess the immune responses offered by seven different types of vaccine.\nVolunteers are being recruited within a 50-mile (80km) radius of Wrexham Maelor Hospital.\nThey are expected to attend the clinic five times over the course of a year, and will be compensated for their time.\nDr Osanlou said: \"We need people who have had two doses of the vaccine and are aged over 30, and who had been vaccinated by the end of March, to take part. \n\"We are particularly interested in anybody aged over 70 and anybody who has had the AstraZeneca vaccines.\"\nSue Cusack from Montgomery in Powys was one of the first to receive a booster jab in Wrexham this week.\n\"I wasn't nervous, it was more exciting really,\" she said. \"It felt special to be part of the process which means that other people can have it in the future.\"\nShe said: \"There is just the one place in Wales that is offering it. It was quite accessible to get there, and it's nice that Wales is taking part as part of the UK, and as part of the bigger process.\"\nNicola Williams, director of research, support and delivery for Health and Care Research Wales, which has co-ordinated the trials, thanked those who have volunteered.\n\"It has been an amazing response,\" she said. \"They have been really critical in understanding what treatments work, what treatments don't work, and getting the right sources of information so that we can help support the pandemic response.\"\nThe outcome of the Cov-Boost trial is expected to be known by September, and will inform the further rollout of the UK's immunisation programme.\nVolunteers will be randomly given one of the trial vaccines or the meningitis vaccine, which is the control. \nOne booster will be provided to each volunteer and it could be a different brand to the one they were originally vaccinated with. \nVaccines being trialled include Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Valneva, Janssen and Curevac.\nAll volunteers will be monitored for adverse events and will have blood samples taken to check their immune response."
