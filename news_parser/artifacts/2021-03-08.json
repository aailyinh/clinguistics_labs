      "title": "Nicola Faith: 'Mummy, have they found the red boat yet?'",
      "tags": "Conwy,Fishing,Fishing industry",
      "text": "\"Mummy, have they found the red boat yet?\"\nA small boy and his mother walk past Conwy's medieval castle, the child looking down towards the quayside and a gap in the line of fishing boats anchored there.\nIt is a gap which would normally have been filled by the Nicola Faith, a ten metre vessel that was a familiar sight to Conwy residents.   \nHer distinctive red colour scheme caught children's eyes.  \nPeople on a late-night dog walk would exchange hellos with her owner and skipper Carl McGrath as he unloaded his catch of whelks. \nDown on the quayside, Nathania Minard is also looking at the space where the Nicola Faith would be.  \nHer son Alan was one of the three men on board when the boat set sail on 27 January - and never returned. \n\"He was 20, and quite a bit younger than the other two lads on board\", she says, \"but he always felt like everyone's big brother.\" \nAlan has three siblings, Poppy, 16, Jessica, 6, and two-year-old Percy. \n\"He had waited 18 years to have a little brother. He's just got one and it's devastating that he's not going to be here to see him grow,\" she added.\n\"Every day the other children ask if the policeman is bringing Alan home today. It's heart-breaking. \n\"Jessica keeps asking if I can try ringing his phone again. It makes you feel like a failure as a mother.\"\nThis is one of the reasons why Nathania and her wife Rebekah have joined with families of the other two missing men to set up a fundraising page on the internet site JustGiving.   \nRelatives of 39-year-old Ross Ballantine and 34-year-old Carl McGrath have formed close links with the Minard family to offer support, share information and co-ordinate fund-raising. \nThe families want to hire additional deep sea search expertise to help look for the Nicola Faith and her three crew, working alongside the official investigation currently being run by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB). \nIn less than a week, the appeal had raised \u00a327,000. The families say it's an impressive total, but they still need to raise more. \n\"Everything raised is a great comfort to us at the moment. There's so much love towards the boys. It shows how much people care and that they haven't forgotten,\" added Nathania.\n\"They deserve better than for the case to remain open for years, we can't do that.\n\"Alan had his whole future ahead of him. He was a natural engineer and kept our ancient vacuum cleaner going for years by constantly repairing it. \n\"We bought him a games console for Christmas one year and he took it to bits within six months, then forgot how to put it back together again! \n\"He's one of those people who will always have work. He'd got a marine engineering apprenticeship in Devon, but when work dried up because of the pandemic, he headed back to north Wales and landed a job on board the Nicola Faith. \n\"He's a grafter. Over the last year, he'd turned from a boy into a man and we were so proud of him. \n\"He got on really well with Carl on board the Nicola Faith. Carl appreciated Alan because he was a hard worker - they really hit it off. It's hard to believe Alan had only been on the crew two weeks.\" \nAlan was not the only man new to the crew. Ross had come on board the when his work as a carpet fitter also slowed down because of the coronavirus pandemic. \nHis sister Lowri Taylor said: \"He's a devoted dad. Working on a fishing boat isn't easy, but he loved it. \n\"The job meant he could see his two boys more often. He could stay local for them rather than having to work away during the week.\" \nThe mother of those two boys is one of the many people around the Conwy area helping the families begin their private search. \nZoey Walker runs Dollybirds Beauty Parlour in Llandudno and is co-ordinating a fundraising auction.  \nShe said: \"My boys feel we are doing something to help after a horrendous month of not knowing and such a devastating time for them.\" \nSinger Tom Stockdale is to shave his head live online over the weekend.  \nAnother local supporter is running laps of the Great Orme headland in Llandudno to raise funds. Others are organising raffles. \nIt reflects the warmth felt towards all three crewmen on the quayside in Conwy and in the wider community.  \nOne boat owner mentions how he and Carl would lend each other engine spares. Others speak of the energy he brought to the local fishing industry and the time and effort he spent maintaining and upgrading the boat.\nNathania added: \"We've been overwhelmed at the support we've had from our own community and from further afield. \n\"We're not going to give up, we need to know where they are, we need to know what happened. \n\"It's not just to answer our questions today but as the children get older, there'll be questions that they'll ask and I don't want years to go by without us knowing.\" \nThe expert who is advising the families about their private search is David Mearns, who successfully found the wreckage of the plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson when it crashed into the English Channel in 2019. \nHe is confident that the Nicola Faith can be located. The families say more sonar surveys will take place this weekend on behalf of the MAIB.   \nOn land they continue to raise money and awareness, while pausing to reflect by the vigil candles and tributes that have been placed on Conwy quayside. \nBut for the moment, the answer to the little boy's question of whether the red boat has been found remains a painful \"no\".

      "tags": "NHS Nightingale Hospitals,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The network of emergency Nightingale hospitals set up to cope with a surge of Covid-19 cases is to close from April, the NHS has said.\nEstablished last spring amid fears that the NHS might be overwhelmed, the temporary hospitals in England were largely not needed.\nSome were used as rehab centres and the sites in London and Sunderland will stay open for vaccinations.\nThe NHS said they had been the \"ultimate insurance policy\".\nSeven Nightingale hospitals were built in England, starting in April 2020 with the 4,000-bed facility at London's ExCel centre. Another was set up in Belfast, while Scotland and Wales had their own temporary hospitals.\nBut they were never used on a large scale, because the NHS did not have enough trained staff to fill the Nightingales as well as the permanent hospitals.\nDuring the winter surge in coronavirus cases, Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said they had been built to avoid a situation like that seen in northern Italy in spring last year. But he said it would be a \"success\" if they were not used.\nYorkshire's 500-bed hospital, opened by Capt Sir Tom Moore, will close next month without treating a single patient. It will operate as a testing centre until then.\nThe London site treated 20 patients during the first wave of the pandemic. It reopened in January and was used to treat non-coronavirus patients to free up beds for a surge in Covid-19 cases and other very seriously ill people.\nIt was built in nine days, with its first 500 beds fully equipped with oxygen and ventilators. If it had reached full capacity, it would have been one of the world's largest hospitals.\nExeter's Nightingale hospital began admitting patients in November, when cases in the South West of England exceeded the first wave of the pandemic, with the NHS describing it as an \"invaluable resource\".\nAn NHS spokesman said that as the health service learned more about Covid-19 and how to successfully treat it, existing hospitals were able to adapt to increase critical care capacity.\n\"Even in the winter wave - which saw more than 100,000 patients with the virus admitted in a single month - there were beds available across the country,\" the spokesman said.\nBut the NHS said the Nightingale hospitals had been \"on hand as the ultimate insurance policy in case existing hospital capacity was overwhelmed\"."

      "title": "George Floyd death: How will jurors be selected in Derek Chauvin trial?",
      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Deaths in custody,US police killings,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "It was video footage seen across the world - Derek Chauvin with his knee pressed on the neck of George Floyd for about nine minutes before he died. \nNow the former US police officer faces trial on second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.\nThree other dismissed officers will stand trial together later this year, but proceedings in Mr Chauvin's trial will start on Monday, when jury selection begins.\nA pool of eligible local citizens has been called to appear by Hennepin County in Minnesota. From them, a jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected. It could take weeks.\nAlthough it is highly unlikely potential jurors will have no prior knowledge of the case - George Floyd's death in May last year in Minneapolis inspired weeks of global protests - they will be questioned to determine whether they will be able to judge Derek Chauvin fairly.\nThe prosecution and defence can both ask Judge Peter Cahill to dismiss a potential juror \"for cause\" if they perceive bias. The prosecution can also dismiss nine potential jurors - and the defence team 15 - without giving any reason, although this can be objected to.\nOnce 16 people have been approved, the jury can be seated. The trial itself will not begin until 29 March. \nEach potential juror has already been asked to fill in a 16-page questionnaire about the case.\nThe main thrust is to determine familiarity with the case and issues such as a potential juror's own interactions with law enforcement.\nKey questions include:\nHow potential jurors respond can lead to either defence or prosecution dismissing them.\nProf Valerie Hans, a jury researcher based at Cornell Law School, says the questionnaire is more detailed and personal than most pre-trial documents, and asks about their \"deepest attitudes on some of the most important political and social topics of the day\".\nProf Hans says the aim for the two teams is to get \"a sense of whether or not a prospective juror will be open to the kinds of arguments that they intend to make over the course of the trial\".\nThe selection process is different from the UK. Jury trials there are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances.\nIn cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived. A lack of diversity could lead to questions about the legitimacy of the verdict.\nThe jury pool in Hennepin County was 80% white and 8% black in the financial year to September 2020, the New York Times reported, a bigger gap than for Minneapolis as a whole (64% to 19%).\nThe vetting system does try to ensure that a cross-section of society is represented, but at the same time, both defence and prosecution will be looking for jurors that will bring them a favourable outcome.\nIn high-stakes trials, they often use special consultants who look at factors such as the jurors' backgrounds and even their body language.\nProf Hans says the judge will need to keep a close eye on patterns emerging among dismissals of potential jurors by the prosecution or defence, as this cannot be done on race grounds.\nIn general terms, legal experts say white jurors are less likely to convict law enforcement officials, although it is in unclear how much of this has changed following the worldwide reaction to the Floyd case.\nThe chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. \nIt's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences.\nThe high-profile video of George Floyd's death brought an outpouring of anger in the US and beyond, but securing a legal conviction is another matter.\nThe first issue is the charges. To convict of second-degree murder, jurors must find that Mr Chauvin had committed, or was trying to commit, a felony that caused the death.\nSecond-degree manslaughter would mean Mr Chauvin had consciously taken the chance of causing death or injury through his negligent actions.\nThe defence will point to Floyd's health issues or drug consumption as a likely cause of death - although the judge has already written that the prosecution only has to prove Mr Chauvin's actions were a \"substantial causal factor\".\nThe defence will also argue Mr Chauvin was authorised to use force in his role as a police officer, in an attempt to undermine the accusation that he was trying to commit a felony.\nThe prosecution will rely on the strong video evidence, pointing to the length of time Floyd's neck was pressed as passers-by pleaded for him, and alleging that the officer broke police department policy.\nIt will also submit evidence of Mr Chauvin's actions in separate cases. This will include an instance where the officer restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck."

      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said.  \nThe Queen confirmed the couple would not \"continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service\".\nA statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan \"remain much loved members of the family\".\nThe couple said \"service is universal\" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented.\nThe duke and duchess said last January they would step back as \"senior\" royals and work to become financially independent. \nThe couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with a plan to review the arrangements after 12 months.\nThe confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. \nUnder the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one.\nTheir departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family.\nA statement from Buckingham Palace said: \"The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. \n\"While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family.\"\nA spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: \"As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role.\"\nThey added: \"We can all live a life of service. Service is universal.\"\nThis could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye.\nBut instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, with the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital - look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining.\nThe statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out.\nNot so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, \"committed to duty and service\" - and \"service\", far from being a matter of titles and roles, \"is universal\". There is more than a flash of anger in their words.\nLike all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other.\nAs to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. \"Don't cock it up,\" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow.\nSeveral of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement.\nThe Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was \"very lucky\" to have had their \"keen support and encouragement\" in its formative years. \n\"We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,\" the trust said in a statement. \nThe Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been \"a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education\" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019.  \nAnd the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had \"championed\" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. \nMeanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry \"for his time, care and commitment\" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. \nThe Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had \"greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game\". \nHowever, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation.\nThe duke remained \"fully committed\" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. \n\"His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,\" the statement added. \nHarry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. \nSmart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. \nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen.\nFor Harry, those are:\nAnd for Meghan:\nBroadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained \"his number one priority\" and suggested a desire to have \"an element of control\" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. \n\"So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,\" he added. \nThe announcement comes days after the couple revealed they are expecting their second child.\nThey are due to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month.\nSince stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals with streaming giants Netflix and Spotify.\nThe duchess recently won a High Court privacy battle against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.\nEarlier this month, Harry also successfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he \"turned his back\" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

      "text": "In her emotional interview with broadcaster Oprah Winfrey, the Duchess of Sussex said that racism she experienced as a member of the British Royal Family contributed to her having suicidal thoughts.\nRacism from within the Royal household and the media had played a part in her feeling she \"didn't want to be alive anymore\", Meghan said.\nWatching in the US, a number of prominent black women said this showed the devastating effect of bigotry.\nThe impact of \"systematic oppression and victimisation are devastating, isolating and all too often lethal,\" tennis star Serena Williams, who is a friend of Meghan, posted on Instagram.\nOthers said Americans were likely to be shocked by Meghan's revelation that concerns were raised about the colour of the couple's baby's skin.\nThe Royal Family has not yet responded to the claims made by Meghan and Prince Harry.\nWriting that she knew first-hand how sexism and racism were used \"to vilify\" women of colour, Williams said: \"I want Meghan's daughter, my daughter and your daughter to live in a society driven by respect.\"\nThe couple revealed in the interview that they are expecting a baby girl in the summer. \nBernice King, daughter of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, tweeted \"royalty is not a shield from the devastation and despair of racism\", adding: \"I'm grateful that Meghan Markle is still here.\"\nTalking about her and Prince Harry's son Archie, Meghan said that within the Royal household there were \"concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born\".\nErin Vanderhoof, a journalist with Vanity Fair magazine, told the BBC that it was \"really really taboo\" in America to ask questions about a baby's skin colour, calling it \"past the line\".\n\"That taboo against inter-racial marriage and the ways that it does still survive is something that we know as being racist,\" she explained. \nAlthough she suggested most people in the US understood that the Royal Family was \"not representative\" of all British people, Ms Vanderhoof said that seeing \"a self-made person rejected and mocked\" nonetheless confirmed some ideas about elitism in Britain.\nMeanwhile, Stephanie Guerilus, secretary of the New York Association of Black Journalists, told BBC News that \"bullying Meghan Markle has become a national past-time\" in Britain.\nEnquiring about a baby's skin tone could come from ignorance, she said, but asking questions in succession would suggest to her that they were motivated by racism.\nIn asking these questions, \"you are othering this child while he is still in the womb,\" she explained.\nMeghan's candour and \"brave\" decision to leave the Royal Family was also praised, including by US Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman.\n\"Meghan's strength will certainly redefine family everywhere,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\"Think of the women who will be inspired to stand up for their lives, the partners who will be kinder and more courageous than the kin they were born into,\" she said. \nIn Britain too, some black women have reacted to the interview. Political and women's rights activist Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu told BBC News that \"racism is so normalised\" that many white viewers would deny that what Meghan experienced was racism.\nPeople \"want to deny that the Royal Family as an institution is rooted in colonialism, racism and white supremacy\", she added.\nWhile the couple said they had difficult moments with some members of the Royal Family, including Harry's father Prince Charles, they talked fondly about the Queen who Meghan said reminded her of her grandmother."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Douglas Ross,Glasgow,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "Police Scotland has condemned Rangers for failing to ask fans to return home after they gathered in Glasgow for title celebrations.\nA senior officer said there had been a \"lack of support\" from the club despite repeated requests from police. \nEarlier Deputy First Minister John Swinney also criticised Rangers for a \"lack of leadership\".\nRangers insisted its fans had been urged to follow the lockdown guidelines.\nLarge numbers of supporters flouted Covid rules to gather at Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square on Sunday after the club won the Scottish Premiership.\nOfficers made 28 arrests and handed out fixed penalty notices for a variety of offences including assaulting police officers, sectarian-related breaches of the peace, breaking Covid rules, and use of pyrotechnics. \nPolice later said no officers were injured and confirmed those arrested were aged 18 to 44.\nDeputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said the behaviour of some supporters was \"disgraceful\".\nHe added: \"I also strongly condemn the lack of support from Rangers Football Club over the messages we repeatedly asked them to put out to persuade fans not to go out celebrating and encourage those who did gather in large numbers to return home.\n\"We've been planning for the conclusion of the football season for some time since the league was allowed to resume and the sport is in a very privileged position given the restrictions seen across the country for almost a year.\n\"It was very clear through the lack of messaging that Rangers did not take seriously their responsibilities in terms of seeking to persuade their fans to celebrate safely and responsibly.\"\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney condemned the scenes as \"an absolute disgrace\" which had undermined recent progress against the virus.\nHe said Rangers had been reminded of the need for fans to adhere to the restrictions by the Scottish government and Police Scotland during meetings on 26 February and 5 March.\n\"The Scottish government will be making our extreme disappointment at the lack of leadership clear to the team management.\"\nMr Swinney acknowledged that the title win was a \"special moment\" for the club and praised those fans who celebrated at home but he said it was \"shameful\" to see so many people deliberately flouting the rules. \n\"Events like yesterday risk spreading the virus and they show no regard or respect at all for the millions of households across Scotland who have stuck to the rules, who have not been able to meet up with friends and family to fully celebrate birthdays and other milestones or, in some case, attend funeral services of their loved ones,\" he said at the government's coronavirus briefing.\nUnder current Scottish government coronavirus guidance, public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. \nGlasgow City Council said a number of memorial benches donated by grieving relatives were damaged in George Square, and that it was working to trace the families. \nThe council promised that the benches, one of which was apparently in memory of a 10-year-old girl, would be restored.\nA crowdfunding appeal to pay for the repairs, set up by the owner of the Louden Tavern at Ibrox Stadium, quickly raised its \u00a35,500 target, with any extra funds being donated to the Anthony Nolan cancer charity. \nRangers took the title for the first time since 2011 after Celtic failed to beat Dundee United on Sunday.\nCrowds of fans took to the streets after the game. Some let off flares while others chanted and waved flags outside the club ground, while supporters also gathered in George Square to celebrate.\nRangers issued a statement on Monday, in which the club said it had \"proactively engaged\" with its local MP, the justice minister, the Scottish government, Police Scotland and the SPFL in a bid to to maintain \"a cohesive message regarding public safety during the Covid-19 pandemic\".\nThe statement continued: \"We understand the jubilance of our support across the world who recognise this has been a historic year for the club.\n\"Nevertheless, it has been of great frustration for all football fans across the world that they have not been able to watch their team within stadiums, especially for the loyal Rangers season-ticket holders who have stood by this football club through thick and thin in the last decade.\n\"We reiterate the message from our manager, Steven Gerrard, who highlighted that fans should adhere to government guidelines - stay safe, socially distance and look after each other in this difficult time.\"\nOn Twitter, the statement was accompanied by a clip of Gerrard from Friday's pre-match press conference.\nThe club said it was aware that there could be more \"significant milestones\" this season, and would \"continue to proactively engage with key stakeholders to maintain a cohesive message in relation to government guidance at this present time\".\nHowever, Mr Swinney said messaging from the club on Sunday could have helped diffuse the situation and disperse the crowds.\n\"I think it would have been the duty of Rangers to say clearly and simply to fans that they shouldn't have come out to celebrate and when they did they should have gone home,\" he said.\n\"The silence from Rangers was deafening - that's a matter of profound regret.\"\nScotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith warned there was a \"real risk\" the celebrations would lead to a spike in Covid infections in the coming weeks.\nHe added: \"It was quite demoralising to see so many people coming together. \n\"I am sure my colleagues across the NHS who at this stage in the pandemic are pretty exhausted felt the same way when they saw so many people mixing so freely without distancing or masks.\"\nFootball supporters have also been accused of breaking coronavirus rules in Belfast and in Corby - which is known as \"little Scotland\" - following Rangers' win. \nLast May thousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelines and gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years.\nAnd in November hundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon."

      "text": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained at an Iranian airport in April 2016, while travelling home to London with her young daughter.\nThe British-Iranian was sentenced to five years in prison - for allegedly plotting against the Iranian government.\nShe maintains her innocence, saying she was on holiday in Iran visiting family.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, has dual British and Iranian citizenship, and before her arrest lived in London with her husband Richard Ratcliffe, who is an accountant.\nShe worked as a project manager for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation and was previously employed by BBC Media Action, an international development charity.\nShe says she took her daughter Gabriella, now six, to Iran in March 2016 to celebrate the country's new year and visit her parents.\nIranian authorities allege Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was plotting to topple the government in Tehran - but no official charges have been made public.\nIran's Revolutionary Guards said she was leading a \"foreign-linked hostile network\" when she visited.\nBoth the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action issued statements saying she was not working in Iran but was on holiday there.\nMr Ratcliffe said he had asked his wife what the charges were during a phone call in 2016, and a nearby prison guard had said: \"National security charges\".\nIn October last year, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would \"redouble\" its efforts to secure Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release after her daughter Gabriella returned to the UK.\nA month earlier, newly-appointed prime minister Boris Johnson had called for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's immediate release during a meeting with Iran President Hassan Rouhani.\nHe had previously been involved in the case when he was foreign secretary. In November 2017, he had to apologise after he was criticised for suggesting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists when she was arrested, rather than on holiday.\nCampaigners said she could face an increased prison sentence in Iran as a result of the comments.\nThe following month Mr Johnson visited Tehran and met his counterpart as well as President Rouhani, and pressed for her release on humanitarian grounds.\nTheresa May had also raised concerns when she was prime minister.\nIn March 2019, then-Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - Mr Johnson's successor - announced Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be given diplomatic protection -  making the case a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who maintains her innocence, mostly speaks publicly through her husband, who regularly calls her.\nAccording to Mr Ratcliffe, she misses Gabriella \"all the time\" and is in a \"pretty fragile\" state of mental health. \nIn an open letter, published in October 2019, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said weekly visits from her daughter had sustained her during her imprisonment.\nWriting before Gabriella returned to the UK to start school, she said the thought of being unable to hold her child was \"the deepest torture of them all\". \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's five-year-sentence was handed down on 6 September - one day after the UK appointed an ambassador to Iran for the first time since 2011.\nMr Ratcliffe said the timing was proof his wife is being held as a political bargaining chip.\nIt has been claimed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being held in order to force the UK into settling a multi-million pound dispute with Iran, which dates back to the 1970s.\nBBC diplomatic correspondent Caroline Hawley said London and Tehran do not see eye-to-eye on Iran's role in the wider Middle East or on human rights.\nIran's Revolutionary Guards are hardliners, opposed to Iran's nuclear deal struck by moderates with the West in 2015. And in 2009, Britain was accused of fuelling unprecedented street protests.\nTensions between the nations increased last year after a series of incidents in and around the Gulf, including Iran seizing a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz."

      "text": "Education Minister Peter Weir is to bring forward a proposal to scrap the plan to pull P1-P3 children back out of classes on 22 March.\nNI's youngest pupils returned to school on Monday for the first time since before the Christmas break.\nChildren in primary one to primary three (aged four to seven) and those in nursery and pre-school went back to class.\nThe plan is that they will then return to remote learning on 22 March.\nHowever, Mr Weir said this does not make \"enormous sense\" and he will bring a specific proposal to the executive for those year groups to continue in the classroom.\n\"I think we need to see continuity of learning,\" he said.\nOn Monday a further two coronavirus-linked deaths and 144 new cases were reported by the Department of Health.\nIt brings the death toll recorded by the department to 2,077.\nThere are 220 inpatients being treated for coronavirus in Northern Ireland hospitals and 35 people in ICU, 25 of whom are ventilated. \nAs of Monday, 631,654 Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland, of which 588,803 were first doses and 42,851 were second doses.\nMeanwhile no further coronavirus-linked deaths have been recorded in the Republic of Ireland. \nAs of Monday, the country's death toll remains at 4,422. A further 437 new cases were reported. \nThere are 418 patients currently being treated for Covid-19 in the Republic, 103 of which are in ICU. \nOnly special schools in Northern Ireland have remained open to all pupils since the start of term in January.\nVulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have also been able to attend school and can keep doing so.\nThat has meant about 90% of Northern Ireland's 350,000 children have been learning remotely for more than two months.\nThe executive has decided that the youngest pupils should return to school first.\nIt is then planned that they will resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of post-primary pupils in years 12 to 14 until the start of the Easter holidays.\nHowever, that has been criticised by some primary school principals and the executive is expected to decide this week whether children in primaries one to three can remain in school until the Easter break.\n\"I'll be bringing proposals forward [to the executive] which will say actually particularly for P1 to P3, they should carry on throughout and I think we don't want to see any more disruption to our young people's education,\" said Mr Weir.\nHe said health officials would need to consider this proposal and his suggestion that other primary school year groups - P4-P7 - also return to classes this month.\nHe said there was \"no substitute for children being directly in school themselves on a face-to-face basis\".\nPupils in primaries four to seven and years eight to 11 in post-primaries do not yet know when they will return to school.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Weir said the return was a \"significant step\" and his main aim was for all pupils to be back in the classroom.\n\"A couple of weeks ago when we took the initial decisions it was probably quite a precautionary mood,\" Mr Weir said. \n\"I want to see that moving as quickly as can be safely accommodated. \n\"I want to see the P1 to P3s remaining in school throughout and I want to see an early return for the remainder of primary and also the remainder of secondary school pupils.\"\nThe minister said he could not guarantee that this would happen but he would be acting as a \"persuader\" with the executive.\nThe minister said he was also working alongside health experts to examine how Covid-19 testing might work in schools and he confirmed that face coverings would also be worn.\n\"It's not necessarily ideal but all these things are about a balance,\" Mr Weir said.\nSchools have also been told that breakfast clubs, education visits, inter-school sports and after-school activities should not take place until at least after Easter.\nThe Department of Education (DE) has previously advised teachers to avoid using terms like \"catch up\" when children return to school.\n\"The vision is for a balanced day where children are able to play, are ready to learn and feel able to re-connect,\" the DE guidance said.\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) has previously said that schools - including special schools - are not a major source of transmission of coronavirus.\nHowever, schools are expected to continue to keep pupils in class 'bubbles' to limit children from different classes mixing.\nSome pupils in Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have already gone back to the classroom as part of a phased return to school.\nSchools in England are reopening to all pupils on Monday.\nThat will be accompanied by mass rapid Covid testing in post-primary schools, although the tests for pupils are voluntary and need parents' permission.\nFrom Monday, there are also some slight changes to Northern Ireland's rules on click-and-collect for non-essential retail.\nClothing and footwear, baby equipment and electrical goods shops can all restart their contactless services, in line with public health advice.\nThe number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space has now also increased to 10 people from two households.\nThe executive will formally review the coronavirus restrictions again next week."

The total number of confirmed cases rose to 223,219 after another 525 positive cases were confirmed.\nThe latest vaccine figures show that about 30% of Northern Ireland's entire population have now had a first dose of a vaccine.

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Buckingham Palace,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex",
      "text": "Meghan Markle was the American actress, with a passion for humanitarian and feminist causes. Harry was the rebel prince turned soldier, considered the world's most eligible bachelor.\nIn the summer of 2016, the two were brought together on a blind date by a mutual friend in London.\n\"Beautiful\" Meghan \"just tripped and fell into my life\", Harry later told the press, and he knew immediately she was \"the one\".\nAfter just two dates, the new couple went on holiday together to Botswana, camping out under the stars.\nThey fell in love \"so incredibly quickly\", proof the \"stars were aligned\", said Harry.\nTo the British press, their romance was catnip. Here was a golden couple who were able to draw vast crowds, speak the language of younger generations and sprinkle royal stardust on any cause.\nFor months the couple avoided the cameras and it wasn't until the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto that the the two were first photographed holding hands in public, smiling and laughing.\nBut there had been signs early on that the fairytale was some way off a \"happily ever after\".\nWhen Harry first confirmed the relationship in late 2016, it came with a stark attack on the media, accusing them of subjecting his girlfriend to \"a wave of abuse and harassment\".\nHe spoke of nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into Meghan's home and the \"bombardment\" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life.\nIt was a problem that was only going to get worse.\nDespite that - or perhaps because of that - the two grew ever closer and in September 2017, Meghan declared to Vanity Fair magazine: \"Personally, I love a great love story.\"\nThe two of them had been enjoying a special time together and were really happy and in love, she said.\nThe media was now on high alert for the sound of royal wedding bells - and they didn't have to wait long.\nIn November 2017, Harry got down on one knee to propose to Meghan as they made roast chicken together at their home in Kensington Palace.\nHarry had designed the ring, made with two diamonds which had belonged to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre was a diamond from Botswana.\nThe couple shared their story in a candid interview with the BBC, and appearing brimming with positivity for the future.\nThey revealed Meghan would give up acting to focus on causes close to her heart, working alongside her husband-to-be.\n\"I know that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it,\" said Harry.\nThings began to shift as preparations got under way for a May 2018 wedding in Windsor.\nIt quickly became clear that this was a royal couple who wanted to do things differently - their way.\nThe wedding, which much of the world tuned in to watch, had all the traditions - a stunning dress, cheeky bridesmaids and heartfelt vows. \nBut, as our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said at the time, the service with its gospel choir, young black cellist and breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, marked it out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple, which seemed to point to a different future for the Royal Family.\nMarried life brought with it new titles - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and a new home at Windsor in Frogmore Cottage.\nIn October of that year, the couple embarked on their first royal tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, over 16 days. It was there that they shared the news that they were expecting their first baby.\nArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, seventh in line to throne and the Queen's eighth great-grandchild, was born on 6 May 2019. \nTo Harry, who was by Meghan's side at the birth, little Archie was \"absolutely to die for\".\nThroughout Meghan's pregnancy, the continual redrawing of battlelines had gone on between the press and the couple. \nThis was to be no repeat of the Duchess of Cambridge's birth with the circus of journalists and photographers lying in wait outside hospital doors for days on end. \nThe press had been told there would be no information about the birth, beyond that it was happening.\nSuch scrutiny and pressure proved to be a struggle for the newly-wed Meghan during her pregnancy and in early motherhood, she later admitted in an ITV documentary filmed during their tour of southern Africa in September. \n\"Not many people have asked if I'm OK,\" she said, looking lost. She spoke of her vulnerability during pregnancy and the challenges of having a new-born - \"it's a lot\".\nAsked if she could cope, she said she had long told Harry it was not enough to just survive - \"that's not the point of life - you have got to thrive\".\nThere were further signs that the couple were not happy, when the prince opened up about his mental health.\nHe said it was under constant management and he lived with the pressures of avoiding a repeat of the past that took his mother, the Princess of Wales, from him. \nShe died in a car crash in Paris when Harry was just 12. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes.\n\"Everything that she went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my wife, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue,\" he added.\nIt has also been suggested the scrutiny of Meghan has been greater because of her African-American heritage. \nFormer US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she wanted to hug Meghan for the British media's \"racist\" treatment of her, while Harry has highlighted how \"unconscious bias\" can lead to racist behaviour even if people do not consider themselves to be racist.\nThe couple's frustration and anger with some sections of the press has gone from being a matter between the palace and editors into the full glare of the public spotlight.\nMeghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters and Harry filed proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking.\nAs such a dramatic year came to a close, the royal couple took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia.\nIt gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped their bombshell announcement.\nNeither Harry's father, Prince Charles, nor his older brother, Prince William, with whom Harry has said he has \"good days\" and \"bad days\", were consulted.\nHarry and Meghan were, they told their Instagram followers, planning to leave their royal duties - and the royal purse - behind.\nThey hope their next chapter, spent in North America as well as the UK, will see the two of them, together with baby Archie, make their own path to the future."

HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint too.\nPaul Hubble used to have to leave his home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, at 06:10 to get to his desk at Barclays' London headquarters in Canary Wharf by 09:00 - a morning commute of two-and-a-half hours.\nHe had to leave just before 17:00 if he wanted to make it home for 1930.\nBut since home-working became the norm for Barclays employees, Paul says he can get more done.\n\"I now have more time for myself but also can be more productive in that I can start work early and finish work later,\" he told the BBC. Plus he saves \u00a36,000 a year on his rail season ticket.\nIt also means he can make time for a mid-afternoon dog walk, which he says is a \"great way of recharging the batteries\".\nHowever, others such as investment bank Goldman Sachs have rejected remote working as the \"new normal\", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an \"aberration\".\nLast month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was \"not sustainable\". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: \"It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.\"\nAccording to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, the number of employees returning to work full-time is gradually increasing.\nIts survey of 4,000 people between 24 and 28 February found that 39% of adults said they were exclusively working outside the home, compared with 32% who were only working from home. \nThe figures show about 10% are combining home-working and going in to the office. The peak of this trend came at the end of last September at 14%."

      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's much-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey has aired in the US and the UK - with the couple sharing their side of the story about life in the Royal Family.\nThe couple spoke about their relationships with other royals, racism and how their mental health suffered.\nMeghan spoke with Oprah for most of the interview, before being joined by Prince Harry.\nOne of the biggest allegations from the interview was that there were \"several conversations\" within the Royal Family about how dark Meghan and Harry's baby might be.\n\"In those months when I was pregnant [there were] concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,\" said Meghan.\nShe said the conversations were with Harry, who relayed them to her. Both she and Harry refused to say which royal said it. \n\"That conversation, I am never going to share,\" said Harry. \"At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.\"\nHarry also said that it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the \"colonial undertones\" of news headlines and articles.\nOne story that circulated in the newspapers a few years ago was that the Duchess of Cambridge was left in tears by Meghan in the run-up to the wedding in a row over flower girl dresses.\nBut Meghan told Oprah the reverse was true. \n\"A few days before the wedding [Kate] was upset about the flower girl dresses and it made me cry,\" Meghan said. She said Kate later apologised and brought flowers and a note to make amends. \n\"I'm not sharing that piece about Kate to be disparaging about her,\" Meghan said. She said Kate was \"a good person\" and hoped that she would have wanted the false stories corrected.\nMeghan spoke about how lonely she felt after joining the Royal Family and the loss of her freedom. \"When I joined that family, that was the last time until we came here that I saw my passport, my driver's licence, my keys, all that gets turned over,\" she said.\nShe said her mental health got so bad that she \"didn't want to be alive any more\".\n\"I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help, said I had never felt that way before and need to go somewhere, and I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution.\"\nShe said she went to \"one of the most senior people\" within the institution and then to the palace human resources department. \"Nothing was ever done,\" she added.\nPrincess Diana's name came up many times throughout the interview - with similarities drawn between their experiences of being in the Royal Family.\n\"I didn't even know who to turn to,\" said Meghan, of the time when she was struggling. \"One of the people I reached out to who's continued to be a friend and confidante was one of my husband's mom's best friends.\n\"Because it's like who else could understand what it's actually like on the inside?\"\nOprah asked Harry about his relationships with his family and especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother, the Duke of Cambridge. \nAt one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles \"stopped taking my calls\".\n\"I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like and Archie's his grandson.\n\"But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship.\"\nOn William, Harry said he loved him to bits and they have been through hell together. \"But we were on different paths.\"\nHarry said he has a \"really good\" relationship with his grandmother and he has spoken to her more in the past year - including video calls with Archie - than he has for many years.\n\"She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be.\"\nMeghan also praised the Queen and said she gave her some beautiful jewellery for the couple's first joint engagement together as well as sharing a blanket with her to keep warm while travelling together.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Harry said his family \"literally cut me off financially\".\nHe said the Netflix and Spotify deals that he and Meghan have struck to make shows and podcasts were never part of the plan but \"I had to afford security for us\".\n\"But I've got what my mum left me and without that we wouldn't have been able to do this.\"\nThe couple reveal that, after they were cut off, American billionaire and media mogul Tyler Perry provided Harry and Meghan with a home and security last year when they moved from Canada to southern California.\nMeghan said that the evening after she told Harry that she was feeling suicidal, they had to attend an official event at the Royal Albert Hall.\nMeghan spoke about a photo that has haunted her because of what it reminded her of.\nShe said a friend had commented how great the couple looked but she added: \"That picture, if you zoom in, what I see is how tightly his knuckles are gripped around mine,\" she told Oprah, as she became emotional. \n\"We are smiling and doing our job but we're both just trying to hold on. \"Every time those lights went down in that royal box, I was just weeping.\"\nTalking about the first time she met the Queen, Meghan said she was surprised to learn she had to curtsy. \nShe said she thought it was just \"part of the fanfare\" and didn't happen inside the Royal Family\nShe described having to quickly practise curtsying before an impromptu lunch with the Queen. \"I said: 'It's your grandmother,\" said Meghan. \"He said: 'It's the Queen.'\" \nMeghan added that she hadn't done any research on the family before joining - and insisted she had never looked up her husband online while they were dating.\nMillions of people watched Harry and Meghan tie the knot at Windsor Castle in 2018. That ceremony was when they were legally married - but the couple revealed they also exchanged vows in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury three days before.\nMeghan said: \"We called the archbishop and we just said, 'look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world but we want our union between us... just the two of us in our backyard'.\"\nHarry spoke about Archie, and the joy he gets from taking him out on bike rides. The interview included a clip of the toddler playing on the beach with his parents.\nThe couple joked that his favourite word for the past few weeks has been \"hydrate\", and Harry said whenever anyone leaves the house, Archie tells them \"drive safe\".\nThe couple confirm they're expecting a baby girl in the summer.\nHarry said it was \"amazing\", adding: \"What more can you ask for?\" - but said they would be done after baby number two arrives.\nTowards the end of the interview, Oprah asked if Meghan had got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. \"Greater than any fairytale that you've ever read,\" she said."

      "text": "All parts of Wales have seen a rise in road traffic in recent weeks, compared with the first national lockdown.\nSome areas recorded almost double the amount of vehicles, Traffic Wales and Welsh Government figures reveal. \nThere has been a 62% rise in road use across Wales over the most recent six weeks compared with the first six full weeks of restrictions from March 2020.\nThis is despite almost identical restrictions, with people asked to avoid all non-essential travel. \nTraffic data is recorded by the Welsh Government at specific points on roads, including main routes like the M4 and A55.\nFigures for 2020 and up to 20 February 2021 have been obtained by BBC Wales and from them we can get an indication of the traffic picture throughout the country.\nNewport saw the lowest increase in traffic in Wales, with just over 420,000 (30%) more vehicles recorded.\nThis goes against the trend in the rest of south Wales, with every other site recording a increase higher than 70%.\nBeulah, near Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys saw an increase of 58% - the lowest figure outside the M4.\nThis recent increase follows an initial dip over the Christmas period, which saw the lowest traffic levels of 2020. \nThe traffic levels we are seeing now were not reached last year until the very end of June, 14 weeks after the first restrictions were put in place. \nDuring summer the amount of road traffic recovered to levels seen before any restrictions were in place. \nHowever each subsequent lockdown is seeming to have less of an effect on the numbers.\nProf Stuart Cole, emeritus professor of transport at the University of South Wales, said people were \"overcoming the scare that was put about\" during the first lockdown, but added that commuting was likely to fall because of homeworking.\n\"People just think 'well this is really efficient, I can talk to anybody just as efficiently'. So I think the new market's going to be leisure for the trains,\" he said.\nJohn Parkinson, head of psychology at Bangor University, said while he acknowledged the impact of \"lockdown fatigue,\" he thought people's intentions to follow the rules remained \"incredibly high.\"\n\"If you have an end-point it should help people, it helps planning, commitment, and it helps motivation.\nBut he said as vaccination rates rose, there could be a belief that \"it must be safe now\".\n\"So I imagine that could have a negative impact on compliance to rules.\"  \nConwy has seen one of the largest traffic increases in Wales, with just under the double the amount of traffic recorded. \nData released by Google allows us to calculate changes in travel behaviour of communities over time, compared to a baseline figure taken in January-February 2020.\nUsing this data for Conwy, we can see that the number of people visiting parks and outdoor recreation areas has often reached levels higher than even before the pandemic. \nThe amount of people visiting supermarkets has stayed at around the same level.\nHowever visits to retail and hospitality destinations in general have recently seen levels almost 80% lower than pre-lockdown numbers. \nOne striking decrease in behaviour, seen throughout Wales, is the decrease in people using public transport, with many regions showing more than a 60% reduction, potentially leading to inflated road traffic. \nProf Cole said he thought messaging about avoiding public transport would have a lasting impact on passenger numbers. \n\"You believe [the government] when they say the scientists have said to stay at home, you must not travel on public transport, public transport is dangerous. \n\"That will be in people's minds for quite some time,\" he said.\nHe said reassuring people public transport is safe would take a lot of time, with the most optimistic forecasts showing figures returning to 80% of the pre-pandemic level over the next three years, and only then with no restrictions in place."

      "tags": "Oprah Winfrey,Death of Diana, Princess of Wales,Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,UK Royal Family,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex,The Royal Family and the media",
      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's explosive Oprah interview was significant for many reasons - and one of them was the number of times Prince Harry's mum, Princess Diana, was mentioned.\nMeghan Markle said she spoke to one of Diana's friends about the pressures of joining the Royal Family, \"because it's like who else could understand what it's actually like on the inside?\"\nSimilarities were drawn between their experiences of being in the Royal Family.\nPrince Harry said he had feared history was \"repeating itself\" before he and Meghan stepped back from their roles as senior royals.\nAnd it's not the first time he's compared some tabloid coverage of his wife to the way in which Diana was treated. \nPrincess Diana was considered to be one of the most famous women in the world and often written about in the newspapers - with both her charity work and private life making headlines.\n\"Diana became a royal icon unlike any other. She was globally recognised and internationally famous,\" royal author Katie Nicholl tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nBut, Katie adds, the attention she received wasn't always positive.\n\"Diana was criticised in the press. She was the most famous person in the world and the paparazzi were a constant presence in the lives of Prince William and Harry\".\nJournalist James Brookes agrees.\n\"At times she had a very good relationship with the press and they were on her side. At other times she complained about the media for being intrusive. It was a mixed relationship.\"\nIn later years Diana gave personal interviews to the press that led some to say she was encouraging the publicity and attention.\nMeghan shut down her personal blog when she joined the Royal Family and the majority of her interviews before this one were about her charity work.\nAlthough Katie points out some people believe Meghan and Harry are contradicting themselves.\nIn January 2020, the couple said they would step back from senior royal duties after struggling with the media spotlight. They moved to Canada and then California and it was recently announced they won't return to the UK as working members of the Royal Family.\nBut Katie says they have \"revealed more about their lives now [since moving to America] than they ever did whilst in the UK\".\nSince stepping back from Royal duties, the couple have launched a Spotify podcast, signed a deal with Netflix and given interviews to James Corden and Oprah Winfrey.\n\"People are questioning a couple who moved because they wanted a quiet life, thinking, 'Why are they courting James Corden and Oprah Winfrey and revealing details about their son?'\" adds Katie.\n\"The idea about escaping Britain and the media spotlight doesn't ring true with a lot of people who are seeing more of Harry and Meghan than they ever did when they were in the UK.\"\nHarry told Oprah that the Netflix and Spotify deals were never part of the plan, but his family had \"literally cut me off financially\" in early 2020.\n\"Wherever she went there were huge amounts of journalists and photographers covering her every move,\" says James Brookes.\nJames believes Prince Harry's opinion of the media goes back to when Princess Diana died.\n\"A lot of Harry and William's perspective of the media is tainted by [their mother's death] because in their eyes their mother was hounded by the paparazzi,\" he says.\nPrincess Diana died in a car crash in a road tunnel in Paris on 31 August 1997. Prince Harry was 12 at the time.\nThe driver - Henri Paul - had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes.\nAn inquest later found Diana had been unlawfully killed as result of the \"gross negligence\" of the driver and the paparazzi.\nIn a 2017 BBC documentary, Prince Harry spoke about his mother's death and the role of the paparazzi.\n\"I think one of the hardest things to come to terms with, is the fact that, the people that chased her into the tunnel, were the same people taking photographs of her dying on the back seat of the car.\"\nDespite Prince Harry's statement in October 2019, Katie believes \"Meghan isn't followed or chased by the paparazzi in the way Diana was\".\nHowever she thinks the prince is clearly fed up with the stories which criticise Meghan.\n\"He's attacking the journalists who he believes are constantly fuelling the negative narrative about his wife.\n\"There have been numerous negative stories about spending. Including the cost of renovating their house which has been met by taxpayers' money.\"\nThis money - \u00a32.4m - was later repaid by the couple.\n\"There's also the cost of the Duchess of Sussex's designer outfits, which have gone into hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\"There were separate stories around the wedding. The rumours of Meghan wanting air fresheners in St George's chapel. The rumoured tiara tantrum. The rumoured upset between Meghan and Kate at a bridesmaid fitting for Princess Charlotte.\"\nMeghan told Oprah the reverse was true about the dress fitting before her wedding.\n\"A few days before the wedding [Kate] was upset about the flower girl dresses and it made me cry,\" Meghan said. She said Kate later apologised and brought flowers and a note to make amends.\nShe said Kate was \"a good person\" and hoped that she would have wanted the false stories corrected.\nSome people say Meghan should expect attention because, unlike Princess Diana, she was a celebrity before marrying Harry. That's something Katie disagrees with.\n\"I think even though she had a celebrity lifestyle before, I don't think it compares to being in the Royal Family.\n\"Yes she had celebrity status but she wasn't an A-list actress, like Angelina Jolie or Nicole Kidman. She's said this herself, she's never experienced this level of public scrutiny.\"\nShe adds: \"I think Meghan has come under just as much scrutiny as any other member of the Royal family. People have short memories, but the Duchess of Cambridge also had a rough time in the tabloids.\"\nThe difficulty, Katie says, is that there is a clear public interest in the couple but there is a line about what is acceptable.\n\"It's the job of the press to report on the Royal Family, but it has to be fair and has to be impartial.\"\nA version of this article appeared on 9 January 2020.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Islamic veils,Switzerland",
      "text": "Switzerland has narrowly voted in favour of banning face coverings in public, including the burka or niqab worn by Muslim women.\nOfficial results showed the measure had passed by 51.2% to 48.8% in Sunday's referendum.\nThe proposal was put forward by the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) which campaigned with slogans such as \"Stop extremism\".\nA leading Swiss Islamic group said it was \"a dark day\" for Muslims.\n\"Today's decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority,\" the Central Council of Muslims said in a statement, adding that it would challenge the decision in court.\nThe Swiss government had argued against the ban saying it was not up to the state to dictate what women wear.\nAccording to research by the University of Lucerne (in German), almost no-one in Switzerland wears a burka and only around 30 women wear the niqab. About 5% of Switzerland's population of 8.6 million people are Muslim, most originating from Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo.\nSwiss people are given a direct say in their own affairs under the country's system of direct democracy. They are regularly invited to vote on various issues in national or regional referendums.\nIt is not the first time Islam has figured in a Swiss referendum. In 2009 citizens went against government advice and voted to ban the building of minarets - a proposal also put forward by the SVP which said minarets were a sign of Islamisation.\nThe proposal in Sunday's referendum did not mention Islam directly and was also aimed at stopping violent street protesters from wearing masks. However, the vote was widely referred to as \"the burka ban\".\nThe latest proposal predated the coronavirus pandemic, which has meant all Swiss adults having to wear masks in many settings.\nAnalysis by Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva\nWas today's vote about all face coverings, from niqabs and burkas to the scarves rioters sometimes pull over their faces? \nThat's what the Yes campaigners from the Swiss People's Party insisted - but their posters and literature said otherwise, showing threatening looking women in black niqabs, and warning of Islamic extremism. \nSo does the result mean the Swiss are becoming more extreme? Are they Islamophobic? \nPerhaps not. In the end, the ban only just squeaked through. In the past the Swiss People's Party has had much bigger majorities for its populist initiatives, often aimed at restricting asylum and immigration. \nIt successfully pushed through a ban on minarets in 2009 with a similar campaign to this one. But the debate around face coverings touched all sorts of different nerves. Many Swiss feminists view the burka and niqab as oppressive to women but they also oppose laws telling women what they can and cannot wear.\nWhen it came to voting they were torn. A regular answer from women asked whether they would support the ban was \"Jein\", a cross between \"Ja\" (yes) and \"Nein\" (no). Today's close vote in Switzerland was probably very much a \"Jein\" as well.\nSanija Ameti, a member of Switzerland's Muslim community, told the BBC that the campaign - and the depiction of Muslim women in the posters - had been upsetting. \n\"So many Muslims in Switzerland will feel insulted and not part of this society, and pushed into a corner where they don't belong. We don't look like these women in the pictures, we just don't,\"  she said.\nHowever, others in the Muslim community supported the ban. \nImam Mustafa Memeti, from the city of Bern, told the BBC he thought the motivation behind the campaign was \"probably Islamophobic\". But he said he supported the ban anyway because it could help to emancipate Muslim women in Switzerland.\nAhead of the vote, Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and an SVP lawmaker, described Muslim face coverings as \"a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland\".\n\"In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms,\" he said.\nAmnesty International spoke out against the proposed ban, calling it \"a dangerous policy that violates women's rights, including to freedom of expression and religion\".\nThe wearing of Islamic veils in public has been a controversial topic in other European countries. France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 while the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Bulgaria have put in place full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise, amid warnings that \"undervalued\" nurses could quit.\nThe government is giving workers \"as much as we can\" in the \"tough times\" of the Covid pandemic, Mr Johnson said.\nThe rise, which is being considered by an independent panel, would cover most hospital staff.\nLabour says the proposal goes against a government \"promise\" made last year to give NHS workers a 2.1% pay rise.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had been \"cowardly\" when he \"sneaked\" out the announcement a day after his Budget.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has been under pressure to reconsider its pay proposal since last week, when it officially recommended the 1% rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries.\nNurses have described the proposed pay rise as \"insulting\", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the \"pitiful\" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service.\nMinisters will make their final decision in May after the independent panel makes its own pay recommendations.\nAsked about the proposed pay rise on a visit to a coronavirus vaccination centre in Brent in north London, Mr Johnson said: \"What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time. \n\"Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times.\"\nHe added he was \"massively grateful\" to \"heroic\" health and social care workers during the pandemic.\nBut the Royal College of Nursing reiterated its calls for the government to make a U-turn on the 1% offer.\nThe union's general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, said: \"More of these warm words for nurses are not going to cut it.\"\nThe PM's comments are not the last word on pay.\nAn independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff, it could say that pay should rise above 1%.\nThe government would then have a dilemma - either to ignore the recommendation, or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase.\nBut the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition.\nThe shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned a 1% rise as \"a  disgrace\" but said Labour would \"honour whatever that review body recommends\".\nDuring the years of austerity, it wasn't uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government.\nSo if the independent panel were to support a 1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its position, or face a backlash from the unions.\nLabour's Mr Jonathan Ashworth said Conservative MPs had already voted for a pay rise of 2.1% for NHS workers when a long-term spending plan for the health service passed through the House of Commons in January 2020.\n\"Not only was it promised, it was budgeted for and it was legislated for - this is the law of the land,\" he said.\n\"That should be the basis for which negotiations and discussions are now entered into with the trade unions.\"\nThe Department of Health maintains that the assumption of a 2.1% pay rise was not enshrined in law, and the financial pressures from the pandemic could not have been foreseen.\nThe prime minister said the government had \"tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can\" to tackle Covid, and had provided \u00a362bn to the health service on top of its usual annual allocation of \u00a3140bn.\nPressed by the BBC's Andrew Marr on whether there could be a rethink on the pay rise, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \"What the government has put forward has been passed to an independent review.\n\"We've put forward what we believe we can afford and [it] is part of a process and that [is] what will be looked at,\" he added.\n\"But really, our focus is on making sure we recover from this pandemic.\"\nA government spokesperson has previously said a 1% pay rise would be a \"real-terms increase\", as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%.\nDame Donna has warned the rise would mean just \u00a33.50 more per week in take-home pay for an experienced nurse.\nAt least 1.3 million other public sector staff - including teachers, the armed forces, firefighters and police officers - are about to have their pay frozen for a year.\nThe NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations.\nThe Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will be delayed until the summer because of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an \"interim\" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement.\nNHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised a one-off \u00a3500 \"special recognition\" payment in January, following a similar announcement in Scotland.\nThe Welsh government has said it will not set a \"ceiling\" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22."

      "text": "The first day back at school for millions of children in England has \"gone well\", say head teachers.\nThey are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms.\nPrimary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described it as a \"big day and an emotional day\" for families.\nAt a Downing Street press conference he thanked parents for teaching their children at home: \"We all know that the burden has disproportionately fallen on women - often holding down jobs and providing childcare at the same time.\"\nThe latest coronavirus figures for the UK show:\nAfter more than two months of studying at home, pupils have gone back to the classroom - and an instant survey from the ASCL head teachers' union suggests attendance levels are \"good\" and Covid testing is going ahead as planned.\nThe snapshot of more than 700 secondary schools found take-up of Covid tests as being between 90% to 100% in more than half of schools, between 80% and 90% in a quarter. But in about one in 20 schools, take-up for testing was below 60% of pupils.\nThe Covid tests, with swabs of nose and throat, are voluntary - and there had been warnings that getting parental consent had been the biggest difficulty.\nSecondary pupils are asked to take three tests in school before switching to being tested twice a week at home.\nHead teachers also reported that in nearly three quarters of secondary schools, 90% of pupils were complying with wearing face masks in classrooms, where social distancing is not possible.\n\"These early indications are very encouraging,\" said ASCL leader Geoff Barton.\nAlthough \"strongly recommended\" by the government, it is not compulsory for pupils to wear masks.\nChildren's Minister Vicky Ford said some students might be \"very anxious and nervous\" about them.\nThis fourth big return to school in England since the start of the pandemic comes with questions about catching up on missed lessons, young people's wellbeing and a replacement exam system.\nThe government is considering measures to help pupils, including longer school days and shorter holidays, according to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, visiting a school in East London, said \"the government may need to look more closely at testing arrangements as they're rolled out\" to avoid \"lots of groups or classes having to self-isolate\".\nAt Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London, pupils were returning on Monday morning with a mixture of excitement and nervousness, reports Jeanette Long.\nTomisin, 15, told the BBC: \"I just know that I'm ready for school, because it's been quite a long time being at home doing online school. It's nice to see my friends and people that I used to talk to a lot.\"\nTomisin feels she has missed some parts of her learning, but is \"just hoping I can do my best\" in upcoming tests.\nJoseph, 15, says he is glad to get back to school as it will be easier to work than at home: \"The telly, phone, family - it's really easy to get distracted.\n\"At home I've been able to do all my assignments, but there are a lot of distractions.\"\nBut he was a bit nervous about taking a Covid test: \"The whole process is a bit nerve-racking.\"\nVic, 15, is also glad to be back in school: \"I am very excited to be back, but there obviously is that bit of nervousness. But I feel safe and I know that the school will put my best interests first.\"\nShe says wearing a mask can be difficult but accepts the new guidelines.\n\"It is tricky because you want to take it off and you want to be able to get a bit of ventilation  and you want to be able to talk to the teacher without having to think about the mask. \n\"But, if we've got to do it then we've got to do it - it's the guidelines so we've got to just abide by it.\"\nVic's mother Alison says the school has done everything it can to make the premises safe.\n\"So I'm happy that's she's happy and is ready to return - I think we all need a little bit of normality back in our lives and a bit of routine, so it's good that we've got to this stage I think.\"\nJules White, head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham, West Sussex, said the return brought a mix of \"immense relief tied to a little apprehension\" and meeting friends would be as important for pupils as getting back to learning.\nIn his school of 1,500 pupils, testing began last week and the phased return will stretch into next week.\nRyedale School in Nawton, North Yorkshire, tested all its pupils last week and all year groups will return to face-to-face teaching from Monday.\nPrimary schools have opened for all pupils - but they will not have to take Covid tests or wear masks.\nThe challenge is to \"support pupils socially and emotionally, not just academically\", said Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has said \"everything is strongly in favour\" of pupils returning to school - with extra safety measures in place, such as testing, the wider use of masks and an early \"natural firebreak\" of the Easter holidays.\nA survey of 6,000 parents from the Institute for Fiscal Studies found widespread support for the return to school - with nine in 10 saying they would have sent their children back even if it had not been compulsory.\nBut two-thirds of parents were \"concerned that their child has lost out on learning\".\nBut for many pupils, apart from one day in January before the lockdown, this will be the first week back in school this year.\nThe ambition is that this fourth return - following the short-lived attempt in January and returns last June and September - will be the last needed.\nThe government has appointed Sir Kevan Collins as an \"education recovery commissioner\", who will begin the process of helping pupils make up for the disruption and lost time in school.\nThe latest lockdown has seen the cancellation of A-level, GCSE and vocational exams, and pupils will return to study for a new system based on teachers' grades.\nOfsted inspectors have warned that disadvantaged children are more likely to have been adversely affected - and the government has announced \u00a31.7bn to support catch-up schemes, such as tutoring and summer clubs.\nThere have been concerns about children's mental health during the pandemic - and a study by researchers at the universities of Essex, Surrey and Birmingham reports a \"significant rise in emotional and behavioural difficulties\".\nEngland's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the return to school would be a \"moment of joy\" when students would get back to their teachers and friends.\n\"I do not underestimate how challenging the last few months have been with some children in class and most at home, but I do know how important it is for all children to be back in school, not only for their education but for their mental health and wellbeing,\" said Mr Williamson."

They were also expected to bear the brunt of redundancies announced in last June.\nIn the government's roadmap for ending coronavirus restrictions, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible.\nIt is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June.\nBP's new policy is expected to come into force this summer, after teams have discussed on a case-by-case basis how often and which days they will commute in.\nDo you expect to return full time or part time to the office post pandemic? Share your thoughts on returning to work. Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk\nBP is the latest firm to commit to a new model with the pandemic having shaken up working patterns for many, previously office-based, staff.\nThe boss of insurance firm Phoenix Group told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that its staff would continue working from home for the foreseeable future.\nChief executive Andy Briggs said: \"The vast majority of our colleagues are working from home.\n\"We look forward to getting back into the office in due course, but our business has been able to operate very well working from home, so we're continuing to do that at the moment... although many of us are pleased to see our children go back to school.\"\nLloyds Banking Group is also set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week. HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint too.\nPaul Hubble used to have to leave his home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, at 06:10 to get to his desk at Barclays' London headquarters in Canary Wharf by 09:00 - a morning commute of two-and-a-half hours.\nHe had to leave just before 17:00 if he wanted to make it home for 1930.\nBut since home-working became the norm for Barclays employees, Paul says he can get more done.\n\"I now have more time for myself but also can be more productive in that I can start work early and finish work later,\" he told the BBC. Plus he saves \u00a36,000 a year on his rail season ticket.\nIt also means he can make time for a mid-afternoon dog walk, which he says is a \"great way of recharging the batteries\".\nHowever, others such as investment bank Goldman Sachs have rejected remote working as the \"new normal\", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an \"aberration\".\nLast month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was \"not sustainable\". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: \"It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.\"\nAccording to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, the number of employees returning to work full-time is gradually increasing.\nIts survey of 4,000 people between 24 and 28 February found that 39% of adults said they were exclusively working outside the home, compared with 32% who were only working from home. \nThe figures show about 10% are combining home-working and going in to the office. The peak of this trend came at the end of last September at 14%."

      "text": "The Duke of Sussex has said racism from the tabloid press that filtered into the rest of society was a \"large part\" of why he and his wife left the UK.\nPrince Harry told Oprah Winfrey that the UK tabloid media is \"bigoted\" and creates a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear\".\nHe said he thought the Prince of Wales had to \"make peace with it\".\nThe Society of Editors said the media is not bigoted and is holding the \"rich and powerful to account\".\nMeghan said social media had made the relationship with the press like \"the wild, wild West\" and said the Royal Family's press operation failed to defend her and Harry from untrue stories.\nIn the much-anticipated interview with Oprah, Harry and Meghan covered a range of deeply personal topics, including racism, mental health, their relationship with the media and Royal Family dynamics.\nThe two-hour interview was broadcast last night in the US and was screened in the UK on ITV on Monday night and on ITV Hub, courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS.\nIn other key revelations:\nUS President Joe Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki, said it had taken \"courage\" for Harry and Meghan to tell their own personal story and speak about struggles with mental health.  \nAsked about the claims that the Royal Family had failed to look after the Sussexes' mental health and that one family member had speculated on their unborn child's skin colour, Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined to comment, except to say he \"always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role she plays\".\nHe said \"when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing\", after being asked specifically if he believed the Royal Family was racist.\nIn previously unseen footage from the three hour 20 minutes interview, Oprah asked the prince if the couple left the UK because of racism. Prince Harry replied: \"It was a large part of it.\"\nHe said that shortly after the couple announced they would step back from royal duties, someone who was \"friends with a lot of the editors\" had warned him about their confrontational stance with the press: \"Please don't do this with the media, they will destroy your life.\"\nThe conversation happened at a fundraising dinner in January 2020, a few months after Meghan sued the Mail on Sunday over a private letter and Prince Harry said he feared his wife would fall \"victim to the same powerful forces\" that he lost his mother to.\nThe friend of the editors told him: \"You need to understand that the UK is very bigoted.\" But the duke responded: \"The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids.\"\nSpeaking to Oprah, the prince added: \"But, unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.\" \nHe said that \"sadly\" no-one in the family had said they were sorry that the couple felt they had to move away from royal life because they did not feel supported.\n\"The feeling is that this was our decision, therefore the consequences are on us.\"\nHe said it was \"really hard because I am part of the system with them, I always have been\".\nPrince Harry said he is \"very aware\" that his brother Prince William \"can't leave that system but I have\".\nAsked if William wanted to leave the system, he replied: \"I don't know, I can't speak for him.\"\nHarry said the \"relationship and that control and the fear by the UK tabloids, it's a really, it's a toxic environment\".\nThe duke said he will \"always be there\" for his brother and the rest of his family and he has \"tried to help them to see what has happened\".\nHis father, the Prince of Wales, \"had to make peace\" with the relationship with the media.\nBut Meghan said she and the duke could not make peace with it themselves, saying it was \"different\" because of social media, describing it as \"like the wild, wild West\".\nThe Society of Editors criticised the couple for accusing the media of racism without \"any supporting evidence\".\n\"The UK media has never shied away from holding a spotlight up to those in positions of power, celebrity or influence. If sometimes the questions asked are awkward and embarrassing, then so be it, but the press is most certainly not racist,\" said executive director Ian Murray.\nIn another unaired clip shared by broadcaster CBS on social media, Prince Harry said that in January last year the couple had an invitation to visit the Queen at Sandringham suddenly withdrawn by her private secretary, who said she was \"busy all week\".\n\"When you're head of the firm there are people around you that give you advice. And what has also made me really sad is some of that advice has been really bad,\" said Harry.\nAlso in the unaired footage, the Duchess of Sussex said her treatment in the press had been worse than other royals, saying that although the Duchess of Cambridge being branded \"Waity Katie\" before her marriage to Prince William must have been \"really hard\", it was \"not the same\".\n\"If a member of his family would comfortably say 'we've all had to deal with things that are rude', rude and racist are not the same,\" she said.\n\"And equally you've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you, especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us.\"\nMeghan said there had been an \"obsession about anything in my world\", including the media offering money to track down her parents.\n\"I did everything I could to protect both of them in that media frenzy for over a year,\" she told Oprah."

      "tags": "France,Freedom of expression,Samuel Paty murder,Islamist extremism,Emmanuel Macron,Paris",
      "text": "A French schoolgirl has admitted to spreading false claims about a teacher before he was murdered last year.\nSamuel Paty was beheaded in October after showing students cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.\nThe girl, whose complaints sparked an online campaign against Paty, has now admitted that she was not in the class.\nMr Paty's killing stunned France and led to an outpouring of support at memorial ceremonies and marches around the country.\nThe 13-year-old girl, who has not been officially named, originally told her father that Paty had asked Muslim students to leave the classroom while he showed the cartoon during a class on free speech and blasphemy.\nAccording to evidence given by the girl seen by French media she said: \"I didn't see the cartoons, it was a girl in my class who showed me them.\"\n\"She lied because she felt trapped in a spiral because her classmates had asked her to be a spokesperson,\" her lawyer, Mbeko Tabula, told AFP news agency.\nThe girl's father filed a legal complaint against the teacher and began a social media campaign over the incident based on his daughter's account. He identified Paty and the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, west of Paris.\nProsecutors said shortly after the killing that there was a \"direct causal link\" between the online incitement against Paty and his murder.\nThe perpetrator, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack.\nIt then emerged that the campaign against the history and geography teacher had been based on a distorted account of what had happened in class days earlier.\nAs he had done in similar lessons on free speech in previous years, Paty warned students that he was about to show a depiction of Muhammad. He said anyone who thought they might be offended could close their eyes. \nThe girl had originally claimed the teacher had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room. When she objected she was suspended from school, she said. It now appears that the girl was suspended the day before the class was given, according to Le Parisien newspaper, because of repeated absence from school.\nThe girl explains in her leaked testimony that she made up the story so as not to disappoint her father. He posted two videos on social media in response to the allegations.\nSpeaking on French radio on Tuesday, the Paty family's lawyer said the girl's family knew that she had not been in class on the day in question and why she had been suspended. \"So to come and say now, sorry, I believed my daughter's lies, that's really weak,\" Virginie Le Roy told RTL radio.\nIn a separate development, two university professors have been given police protection after they were accused of Islamophobia by student protesters. \nAn investigation has begun after posters were put up last week at Sciences Po university in Grenoble that read \"Fascists in our lecture halls, Islamophobia kills\", naming the two professors.\nJunior Interior Minister Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa said their lives were in danger and the campaign was reminiscent of the harassment of Samuel Paty. \"We can't tolerate this kind of thing,\" she said.\nAfter Paty's murder, President Emmanuel Macron presented the teacher's family with the nation's highest honour, the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\nDepictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are considered highly offensive by Muslims.\nThe issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet. \nTwelve people were killed by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 after the images were published.\nBoth the Charlie Hebdo murders and Samuel Paty's beheading struck a deep chord in a country where secularism - or la\u00efcit\u00e9 - is central to national identity.\nUnder that principle, the state cannot intervene in matters of religion, and thus should not curb expression to protect the feelings of a particular community."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nAfter millions of pupils returned to schools across England and Northern Ireland today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked teachers, parents and pupils for their \"astonishing\" efforts. He told a Downing Street press conference that the return to schools was \"a big day and an emotional day\". He added that while some have been anxious about the return, \"the greater risk\" would be keeping children out of school \"a day longer\". Head teachers, meanwhile, said the first day back in England had \"gone well\". You can read more about the rules for the reopening of schools here.\nThe latest figures show the UK has recorded a further 65 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and a further 4,712 cases. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, told the Downing Street briefing this meant case levels were back to what they were at the end of September. She warned, however, that \"this is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from\". It is \"really important\" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place, she added. You can read more about the levels of Covid-19 in the UK here.\nBP has told office-based staff they will be expected to spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease. The oil giant said in meetings last month that most would be asked to work from home 40% of the time, or two days a week for full-time employees. The new \"hybrid\" work model will affect 25,000 BP staff, with 6,000 in the UK. It comes as part of a cost-cutting drive for the firm, which saw thousands of job cuts announced last year. BP informed staff of the changes in \"town hall\" meetings in February, and suggested that it would offer a \"more flexible, engaging and dynamic way of working\".\nThe government is sticking to the rule that a positive rapid Covid test done in secondary schools in England cannot be overruled by the gold-standard tests processed by labs. Concerns have been raised by testing experts that significant numbers could be incorrectly told they are infected by the less accurate, rapid tests, leading them and their families to self-isolate for no reason. Asked if children should be allowed to exit self-isolation if the more reliable PCR test gave a negative result, children's minister Vicky Ford told the BBC: \"They should not take the risk, we all want to make sure we can keep Covid out of the classrooms here.\" You can read more about school testing here.\nA mother of eight-year-old triplets has filmed a video diary to record their return to school. The trio - Yimi, Mbetmi and Waimi - said the day was \"big\" and \"important\" and it felt \"so nice\" to be back in their uniforms. Mum Esther, from Hucknall in Nottinghamshire, said: \"The house is so quiet. I kind of miss them... but it's quite a good thing that they are going back to normal.\" You can read more from pupils on their return to school here, and you can watch the video of Yimi, Mbetmi and Waimi below.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "Asylum seekers were housed in cramped and filthy conditions at a military barracks, inspectors have said.\nSome of the most vulnerable people were living in a \"decrepit\" block unfit for habitation at Kent's Napier Barracks.\nThe Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons also visited Penally Camp in Pembrokeshire. They said both sites were \"run-down\".\nThe Home Office said it had instructed service providers to make improvements.\nLabour has said the findings are \"utterly unbelievable\", and Plaid Cymru called for Home Secretary Priti Patel to \"consider her position\". \nInspectors said both sites - which witnessed protests over living conditions in January - were \"run-down and unsuitable\", but particularly criticised Napier.\nThey said given the cramped, communal conditions, \"once one person was infected [with Covid] a large-scale outbreak was virtually inevitable\" at the site.\nIn January, 178 people tested positive for the virus at Napier. \nMany men said they were depressed, and a survey found a third of respondents at both sites had mental health problems, while a third at Napier had felt suicidal.\nInspectors said contractors were given less than two weeks to make both sites operational, and local stakeholders, including healthcare, were not consulted and were given insufficient time to prepare.\nThey listed concerns about the asylum process, including that many residents were told they would be there for weeks, but had been there several months - a major cause of distress that left them not trusting anything they were told.\nMs Patel, who has repeatedly defended the use of Napier, last month said: \"This site has previously accommodated our brave soldiers and army personnel. It is an insult to say that it is not good enough for these individuals.\"\nShadow immigration minister, Holly Lynch, said: \"The Home Secretary has recklessly put the lives of all those staying at the sites, those working there, and the surrounding communities, at risk during a pandemic.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said Ms Patel \"must consider her position\" in the wake of the report, which highlighted \"fundamental failures of leadership and planning by the Home Office\".\nA spokeswoman for the Home Office said: \"During these unprecedented times we have met our statutory duty to provide asylum seekers, who would otherwise be destitute, with suitable accommodation and three meals a day all paid for by the British taxpayer.\n\"We expect the highest possible standards from our service providers and have instructed them to make improvements at the site.\"\nFollowing inspections in February and a follow-up visit to Napier on Thursday, inspectors will now produce a detailed report that will be submitted to Ms Patel.\nThe findings were released on the same day that 115 people crossed the English Channel in seven boats in continued attempts to reach the UK, which the government has said are facilitated by criminals.\nLast year, nearly 8,500 people attempted the journey.\nThe Home Office has said people should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach rather than making the crossings, and has said illegal migrants are being returned to safe countries. \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "title": "Meghan and Harry interview: I didn't want to be alive any more, duchess says",
      "tags": "Oprah Winfrey,UK Royal Family,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex",
      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has said she found life within the British Royal Family so difficult that at times she \"didn't want to be alive any more\".\nIn a deeply personal TV interview, Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she did not get help when she asked for it.\nShe said a low point was when Harry was asked by an unnamed family member \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\nOprah later said Harry had told her it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment.\nThe highly-anticipated interview with Oprah, which the couple were not paid for, aired overnight in the US.\nDuring the two-hour CBS special, to be screened in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday night and on ITV Hub, Courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS, the couple covered a range of topics, including racism, mental health, their relationship with the media and Royal Family dynamics. \nIn other key revelations:\nThe couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family.\nMeghan said that she started to feel lonely when limits were placed on what she could do, revealing that at one point she did not leave the house for months.\nAt one point she thought she \"could not feel lonelier\", she told Oprah.\nAsked by Oprah if she was thinking of self-harm and having suicidal thoughts at some stage,  the 39-year-old replied: \"Yes. This was very, very clear. Very clear and very scary. I didn't know who to turn to in that.\"\nMeghan said that she felt \"haunted\" by a photograph from an official event she attended with Harry at the Royal Albert Hall while she was pregnant.\n\"Right before we had to leave for that (event), I had just had that conversation with Harry that morning,\" Meghan said.\nWinfrey asked: \"That you don't want to be alive any more?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Meghan confirmed. \nShe said that she attended the event with Harry that night because she felt she could not be \"left alone\" and recalled Harry gripping her hand tightly while in attendance at the Royal Albert Hall.\nOprah also asked the duchess why she thought the Royal Family did not make her son Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children do not automatically become princes or princesses because of a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. \n\"In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,\" Meghan said. \nShe said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her.\nAsked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be \"too brown\" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: \"If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one.\"\nWhen pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: \"I think that would be very damaging to them.\"\nHarry also refused to give further details, saying: \"That conversation, I am never going to share.\"\n\"At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,\" he added. \nThe 36-year-old prince said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan following the racism he said his wife faced from the media. \n\"No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,\" Harry said.\nMeghan and Harry have upended the narrative created by Britain's bestselling newspapers. \nThey have revealed the terrible strains inside the palace. They have drawn a picture of unfeeling individuals lost in an uncaring institution. They have spoken of racism within the Royal Family. This was a devastating interview. \nBut Harry describing his brother and father as \"trapped\", and Meghan revealing that she repeatedly sought help within the palace only to be rebuffed, is a body blow to the institution.\nIt's not at all clear if and how the palace will respond. Many of the revelations are so personal that getting any reaction seems unlikely. The Queen has made clear repeatedly the affection in which the couple are still held.\nAs for the newspapers that the couple so despise - will they change their tune? It is not in their nature.\nThere were pages of bile in some Sunday newspapers prior to the interview. Meghan and Harry have given up on getting a fair hearing from many of the most popular publications. It seems highly unlikely that they will see anything published that will make them change their minds.\nDuring the interview, the Royal Family were also accused of failing to protect the duke and duchess, with Meghan saying the situation \"started to really worsen\" after the couple married in May 2018.\n\"I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family.\n\"But they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband.\"\nShe was referencing rumours that she had made the Duchess of Cambridge cry during a disagreement about flower girl dresses - a story that prompted a flurry of tabloid stories.\nMeghan said the opposite happened. She added that Catherine later apologised, bringing flowers and a note to make amends.\nJoining his wife and Oprah for the second half of the interview, Harry talked about his relationship with the rest of his family.\nHe said his relationship with his grandmother, the Queen, was \"really good\" and that the two of them speak often.\nHowever, his relationship with his father, the Prince of Wales, has suffered. \nHarry said that he feels \"really let down\" by his father. He added that he will always love him, but \"there's a lot of hurt that's happened\".\nHe described his father and his brother as \"trapped within the system\" of the Royal Family. \n\"They don't get to leave,\" he added.\nOf Prince William, he said they were on \"different paths\".\nThe interview aired while Harry's grandfather, Prince Philip, was recovering in hospital after a heart procedure - although it was recorded before Prince Philip was admitted. \nWhen he went into hospital, Meghan said she phoned the Queen \"just to check in\". \nShe said the monarch had \"always been wonderful to me\" and recalled her sharing her blanket while travelling together between visits. \nHarry also revealed that his family had cut him off financially at the beginning of last year, after the couple announced their intention to step back as senior royals.  \nHe said deals with Netflix and Spotify were \"never part of the plan\" but they needed them to pay for security staff.\nIn new footage not included in the original interview, Prince Harry was asked if the couple left the UK because of racism, and replied: \"It was a large part of it.\"\nHe recalled a conversation he had with someone with media connections who advised him not to take on the British tabloid press.\nHe said he was told he had to understand that the UK was \"very bigoted\". But Harry recalled that he immediately responded: \"The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids.\"\nThe prince told Oprah: \"But unfortunately if the source of info is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.\" \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Meghan's allegations about racism and lack of mental health support should be taken \"very seriously\". \nAsked whether Boris Johnson agreed with this, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was \"a matter for the palace\" and Mr Johnson had not seen the interview. \nInformation and support: If you or someone you know is feeling emotionally distressed, these organisations offer advice and support. For mental health issues, there are these organisations."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMillions of children in England are going back to school after more than two months studying at home. Many secondary schools will have a phased return during the week, but most primary schools are expected to open for all pupils from Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the return as a first step towards a \"sense of normality\". Read more details on the school reopening - including how pupils will get Covid tests, with analysis from our correspondent Nick Triggle. Meanwhile, from today two people from different households can meet outside for recreation, which can include coffee on a bench, while one nominated person can make care home visits - but only while wearing PPE, and after a Covid test.\nNorthern Ireland's youngest pupils will return to school on Monday for the first time since before the Christmas break. Children in primary one to primary three (aged four to seven) and those in nursery and pre-school are going back. Exam year pupils in secondary schools and colleges will begin going back on 22 March.\nTwo married doctors have came out of retirement to give coronavirus vaccinations, including to their fomer colleagues. Emergency physician Dr Jason Kendall, 55, retired in July after 37 years - and was given a guard of honour when he left Southmead Hospital. Palliative care lead Dr Clare Kendall, 56, retired from North Bristol NHS Trust in October 2019 after 38 years. \"You cannot sit around and see your colleagues struggling to cope in this pandemic,\" she said.\nPolice say arrests were made and fines issued after fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership. Large numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement - despite warnings to stay at home. Nicola Sturgeon said the crowds were \"infuriating and disgraceful\" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown.\nA group of sailors stranded in northern Germany haven't been able to see their families on the other side of the world for nearly two years. One hundred and thirty men from Kiribati, in the Pacific, are living in a youth hostel and are desperate to return - but their country's borders have been sealed.

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Personal finance,Gender pay gap,Pensions",
      "text": "Mothers face more insecure and lower-paid work after having children, official figures suggest.\nWomen with dependent children are seven times more likely to work part-time than men, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nMore than 15% of mums also say they are economically inactive because of caring responsibilities, versus 1.9% of dads.\nOne analyst said \"millions of mums\" were being forced to \"pay the price\" of a less secure career.\nThe new research found that while mums who are employed were more likely to work part-time, only 25% of mothers with a one-year-old worked full-time.\nMore than nine in 10 of the women in part-time work surveyed by the ONS said that they did not want a full-time job.\nBut Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that there was a clear financial cost associated with the decision to work part-time or take a career break.\n\"This doesn't just take a toll during the early years with young children, but throughout the rest of their working life,\" she said.\n\"Not only do they receive lower pay, but later in life, if someone needs to stop work to look after someone else in the family - such as grandchildren or elderly parents - the job typically falls to the lower-earning mum.\"\nThe new figures from the ONS found that employment among mothers fluctuates as children get older and peaks at the age of 15 at 82.1%, before falling back again.\n\"This insecurity feeds into women's ability and willingness to put money aside for the long term. It's one reason why women overwhelmingly favour cash Isas and men are more likely to put money into a stocks-and-shares Isa or a pension,\" Ms Coles added.\nSeparate research published on Monday by Scottish Widows has found that the average woman in her 20s today will retire with \u00a3100,000 less in her pension than her male peers.\nThe pension firm said that women would have to work an extra 37 years if they wanted to close the gap.\nIt blamed their lower average earnings, the higher probability of working part-time and heavier childcare burden. \nAccording to the research, over the first 15 years of their careers, women on average save about \u00a32,200 a year, compared to \u00a33,300 for men.\nThe difference widens over a lifetime as wage increases lead to \"significant inequalities in retirement income\", it said.\nHowever, it added that if women increased their pensions contributions at the start of their careers by 5%, they could close the gap almost completely by the time they retired.\nJackie Leiper, managing director of pensions at Scottish Widows, said: \"We know that young women have been some of the hardest hit by the short-term financial impact of the pandemic and this has only exacerbated the challenge of reaching pensions parity.\n\"At the same time, caring responsibilities and high childcare costs are keeping women out of the workforce, lowering their contributions and denting their pension pots.\"\nA Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: \"Our ground-breaking pension reforms, including automatic enrolment, have helped millions more women save into a pension, many for the first time.\n\"Pension participation among eligible women working in the private sector has risen from 40% in 2012, to 86% in 2019.\""

      "title": "Covid-19: School rapid test cannot be overruled, says minister",
      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is sticking to the rule that a positive rapid Covid test done in secondary schools in England cannot be overruled by the gold-standard tests processed by labs.\nConcerns have been raised by testing experts that significant numbers could be incorrectly told they are infected.\nThey have called for all positives from the rapid testing done in schools to be confirmed by the standard PCR test.\nThis is what will happen when testing is done at home after next week.\nIt will mean a pupil who tests positive at home with a rapid on-the-spot test - known as a lateral flow test - will have to isolate on the basis of that test, but will be told to get a PCR test which is processed in a lab. \nIf that PCR test is negative they will be released from isolation.\nBut for those done in schools - pupils are being offered three tests in the next two weeks - it will be assumed the lateral flow test is right. A PCR test cannot overrule the lateral flow test. \nOne of those who has been affected already is the family of Richard Patton, from Derbyshire.\nHis son tested positive after his school started rapid testing last week, so Mr Patton arranged for the 17-year-old to get a PCR test, which came back negative.\nBut the whole family, including his 15-year-old daughter, is still having to isolate at home.\n\"It makes no sense. They were looking forward to going back to school and are now stuck at home.\"\nThe Royal Statistical Society is one of the bodies which wants to see all positive tests in schools confirmed with a PCR test to avoid such cases.\nProf Sheila Bird, a member of the society's Covid-19 Task Force, has said false positives were \"very likely in the present circumstances\" because the large-scale testing, coupled with the low infection rates, meant the number of false positives could outnumber the true positives. \nHowever, Schools Minister Vicky Ford insisted the approach was right.\nShe told BBC Radio Four's Today Programme that the chances of a false positive - where a pupil is incorrectly diagnosed as having the virus - was \"very low\".\nShe said pupils who test positive via the lateral flow tests done in schools will need to isolate, along with their families and close contacts and \"should not take a PCR\".\n\"The really important thing is to make sure we can keep schools open and minimise the risk of Covid in classrooms,\" she said.\nThe chance of false positives may be very low as ministers suggest. But given that millions of schoolchildren are being offered a test, it could still lead to thousands of people having to self-isolate for no reason.\nIf just half of pupils take up the offer of three tests in school, and the false positive rate is 0.1%, that would lead to around 6,000 pupils being asked to isolate at home over the next week or so when they are not infected. \nThe rest of their family will also have to isolate, which means if they have siblings, they too will miss school. What is more, if the positive comes from the second or third test then the individual's close contacts in school will also be affected.\nIt means many thousands of children could be wrongly denied the chance of being in school after already spending the past two months at home.\nBut what is particularly baffling experts is that it is so unnecessary. Getting the test confirmed by a PCR test processed by a lab would solve the problem. By sticking to their guns, ministers could end up undermining the whole initiative.\nIt is unclear what the true false positive rate will be in school settings. Research by Public Health England has suggested it could be as high as three for every 1,000 tests done, but other studies have suggested it is nearer one.\nThe testing done in schools in recent weeks for the children of key workers and teachers show the number of tests returning positive results is in line with the lower estimate, suggesting a significant number of tests could be false positives.\nUniversity of Bath mathematical biologist Dr Kit Yates warned that the government's stance could undermine confidence in the testing policy.\n\"Not confirming less accurate lateral flow positives with more accurate PCR tests will put people off testing their kids. It's as simple as that.\"\nPrimary school children are not being asked to take rapid tests, but families can request tests for use at home."

      "text": "Police say arrests were made and fines issued after crowds of fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership.\nLarge numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement despite warnings to stay at home.\nNicola Sturgeon said the crowds were \"infuriating and disgraceful\" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown.\nRangers took the title after Celtic failed to beat Dundee United.\nThe result gave Rangers an unassailable 20-point lead and the title for the first time in 10 years.\nUnder current guidance, public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. \nFootball games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium.\nHowever, following Sunday's game, crowds of fans took to the streets, as some let off flares while others chanted and waved flags outside the club ground. In Glasgow city centre fans flocked to George Square to celebrate being crowned Scottish champions.\nIn a tweet, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Rangers on the title win, but added: \"Gathering in crowds just now risks lives, and could delay exit from lockdown for everyone else.\"\n\"If those gathering care at all about the safety of others & the country, they will go home,\" she said.\nIn a later tweet she said: \"I share folks' anger at this.\"\n She added it was \"infuriating and disgraceful\" to see the crowds \"risk our progress\" after everyone complying with lockdown rules has made \"so many sacrifices\".\nCh Supt Mark Sutherland said officers attended gatherings at both George Square and outside Ibrox stadium.\nArrests were made and fixed penalty notices issued for breaches of the Covid restrictions, disorder incidents and the use of pyrotechnic devices, he added. \nIn a statement published shortly before 21:00, he urged fans to make their way home.\nThe PA news agency reported that by 21:30 police officers had encircled a depleting group of fans at the base of the Scott Monument in George Square. \nLast May thousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelines and gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years.\nAnd in November hundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon.\nDavid Hamilton, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said he was \"appalled\" by the scenes.\nHe also told the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that officers, many of whom have not been vaccinated, were put in \"jeopardy\" by the supporters' actions.\nMr Hamilton said he understood why people were frustrated by the Police Scotland response but said that was an operational matter for the force, which would have considered factors such as wider public order issues and road safety.\nHe highlighted that it can take up to 20 minutes to issue a fixed penalty fine for breaches of the Covid restrictions.\nMr Hamilton said: \"If we were to ticket everybody in George Square yesterday we would still be doing it just now.\"\nBut he also criticised the club for being \"silent\" and failing to address the mass gatherings on its social media accounts.\nHe added: \"There is a responsibility to the club here. It should not take the government to have to ask the club to tell people to go home.\n\"That should have been something the club should have taken on themselves proactively.\"\nThe club tweeted or retweeted more than 50 times in the hours after they were crowned champions but did not address the mass gathering of fans.\nSocial psychology expert Prof Stephen Reicher said the celebrations were \"completely predictable\" and \"in some ways encouraged\".\nThe St Andrews University academic said it was \"disappointing that the club did not have a dialogue with the fans about how one can celebrate but in ways that are safe, in ways that don't endanger the public, that don't endanger and, indeed, don't endanger Scottish football\".\nHe warned that it undermined the argument for safely reopening mass events including the Euros championship in Scotland. \nGlasgow Kelvin MSP Sandra White described the celebrations as \"absolute chaos\" and questioned what plans were in place to prevent mass gatherings.\nShe told Good Morning Scotland: \"They [the fans] should never have been allowed to leave Ibrox and march into the city centre in large numbers. It could have been stopped there and then.\n\"People have lost loved ones and people can't visit loved ones and yet this is being facilitated.\" \nRangers fans in Northern Ireland also breached lockdown rules, with a large crowd gathering on Belfast's Shankill Road to celebrate on Sunday evening.\nPolice Service Northern Ireland urged people to celebrate \"at home safely and within the current health regulations\".\nEarlier on Sunday Scotland's justice secretary urged fans not to put lives at risk by flouting lockdown rules.\nHumza Yousaf also warned that Uefa would be paying \"close attention\" in anticipation of the European Championships coming to Scotland.\nFollowing their win, some Rangers players made their way to the fence to celebrate in sight of fans outside.\nSpeaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called the actions of fans outside Ibrox \"completely wrong\".\nHe added: \"We've all done so much to get the virus rates down.\n\"I understand passions run high with football fans, but it clearly didn't match what we expect people to do during a Covid period, while many people still can't even leave their homes.\""

      "text": "Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland are expected to be eased slightly to allow more people to meet up outdoors.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon will update MSPs about the state of the pandemic and lockdown at Holyrood.\nOn Monday, her deputy John Swinney said \"the data is going in the right direction\" and that ministers were \"hopeful\" that measures could be eased.\nHowever the overall \"stay at home\" order is expected to remain in place for some weeks to come.\nMr Swinney said changes would have to be made in a \"sustainable\" manner so that transmission of the virus does not run out of control again.\nAt present, only two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors in Scotland.\nThis was due to increase to four people from two households from 15 March, but this is expected to be brought forward as a result of progress in suppressing new cases.\nThe move - dubbed \"relatively minor but important\" by Ms Sturgeon on Friday - may also see more young people allowed to participate in non-contact sports.\nMore pupils are expected to return to classrooms from next Monday, including remaining primary school years and some secondary students.\nBy late April, the government hopes to move back to a local \"levels\" system of regional restrictions across Scotland, albeit with tougher rules than before.\nMs Sturgeon will review the latest advice and data with her cabinet ministers on Tuesday morning, before announcing their decisions in the Holyrood chamber in the afternoon.\nOn Monday, Mr Swinney said there were \"a lot of grounds for optimism\" - but warned that changes would have to be made carefully.\nHe said: \"The number of cases is falling, the test positivity rate is low, the vaccination programme is going well and the pressure on our hospitals, while still significant, is not as grave as it was earlier on.\n\"The first minister has been clear that we will try to relax lockdown as quickly as we possibly can do, but we have to do it in a sustainable manner.\n\"That means taking the appropriate steps in the appropriate sequence to make sure we don't risk the virus running away from us again.\"\nThe Scottish Conservative have welcomed the easing of restrictions on outdoor meetings but want to see ministers \"move faster\".\nTheir public health spokesman Miles Briggs told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland he wanted to see gyms reopened before the scheduled date of 26 April.\nScottish Labour education spokesman Michael Marra told the programme the public need a \"proper plan\" that delivers hope.\nHe also highlighted the mental health impact of the pandemic and added: \"Everybody is incredibly frustrated.\"\nMinisters have stressed that their approach will be dictated by the latest data and scientific evidence about the pandemic.\nOn Friday, Ms Sturgeon said that the progress of the vaccination programme and declining number of people falling seriously ill \"should give us all real encouragement that greater normality is firmly on the horizon\".\nHowever she warned on Sunday that mass gatherings like those seen in Glasgow after Rangers were confirmed as the Scottish Premiership football champions \"could delay exit from lockdown for everyone else\".\nMr Swinney reiterated this on Monday. He said: \"We will be driven by the data. If the data suddenly - because of all of that commotion at the weekend - goes in the wrong direction, we will have difficult decisions to make. There are consequences that flow from these events.\""

She was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.\nTwo small silver ornamental swords were found next to the bed and there was broken glass on the floor.\nPathologist Dr Charles Wilson, who performed the post-mortem examination on Ms Stringfellow, said she died from a \"sustained and forceful multi-modal assault.\"\nThe inquest heard Mr Papworth had left the house before officers arrived and gone to his mother's home before handing himself in to police.\nHe also called several people to confess, telling one friend \"I've killed her, I've done it, I've had enough\".\nRecording her conclusion, coroner Mrs Slater said: \"Amy-Leanne was obviously very much loved and cherished by her family and friends and clearly will not be forgotten.\"\nMr Papworth died in Leeds Prison in November 2020. The Prison Service would not confirm how he died and said it would be a \"matter for the coroner\" to investigate.\nFollowing Mr Papworth's death, South Yorkshire Police said it was not looking for anyone else in relation to Ms Stringfellow's death.\nAn Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation looking at officers' involvement in the case is ongoing, the inquest heard.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "A series of explosions on Sunday in Equatorial Guinea is now known to have killed 31 people, officials say. The number of those injured rose to 600. \nThe blasts hit a military base in the country's main city, Bata. Officials blame badly stored dynamite along with stubble burning by nearby farmers. \nTeams including volunteers continue to search the wreckage of buildings and homes for victims. \nThree young children were found alive and taken to hospital.  \nLocal media showed a row of covered bodies along a street. \nThere are fears the death toll could rise further as some victims may still be trapped.\nAlmost all buildings and homes in the city suffered \"huge damage\", President Teodoro Obiang Nguema said.\nIn a statement, President Obiang Nguema said the blasts had been caused \"by the negligence of a unit charged with the care and protection of stores of dynamite and explosives\" at the Nkoantoma military base. \nHe said the base had \"caught fire due to neighbouring farmers clearing farming land by setting it alight, leading to the explosion\". The president has appealed for international aid.\nIn a series of tweets, the health ministry called for volunteer health workers to go to Bata Regional Hospital and for urgent blood donations. The ministry said mental health teams were also being deployed to help victims. \nSome hospitals have been overwhelmed by the number of patients admitted, state TV reported. It broadcast images of wounded people lying on the floor of a crowded hospital.\nVideo of the aftermath of the explosions showed a chaotic scene with distressed people fleeing as smoke drifted over the area.\nOne resident told AFP news agency: \"We haven't slept all night. The houses were burning all night long and we kept hearing small explosions.\"\nAnother described how his uncle had found the burned bodies of five members of his family. \nThe only opposition party, the CPDS, described the blasts as \"the greatest humanitarian catastrophe in the history of Equatorial Guinea\" and called on Spain, France and the United States to send aid, including rescue teams, medical staff and medicines.\nThe Spanish embassy said its nationals should remain at home and issued a series of emergency numbers."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Gavin Williamson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Longer school days and shorter holidays are among the measures the government is considering to help pupils in England catch up on lost learning, the education secretary has said. \nGavin Williamson told the BBC ministers were looking at \"how the school year runs\" after the disruption of Covid. \nHe also told Sky News a five-term year and changes to summer holidays were under consideration. \nSchools in England are reopening to all pupils on Monday. \nIt marks the first step of the \"road map\" out of the national lockdown, which has been in place since the beginning of January and has seen most children learning from home since before Christmas.  \nAsked by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether the government was going to extend the school day, Mr Williamson said: \"I think we should be evidence-based and we're looking at that, we're looking at how the school year runs.\"\nMr Williamson also told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that ministers were considering \"a whole range of proposals\". \nThe education secretary was asked whether schools would remain open if the R number rose above one, which means the number of cases is continuing to increase. \n\"We are very much factoring in as part of the road map that actually schools will be staying open,\" Mr Williamson told the BBC. \n\"That is why we are taking a cautious approach because we intend for it to be an irreversible approach and that schools will continue to remain open.\"\nHe also gave a guarantee that schools would return after the Easter holidays. \nDr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England, said she did not think the reopening of schools should be paused if the R number rose above one. \nWith three weeks before the Easter holiday, she told the BBC there would be time to look at the data \"very carefully\". \nShe said the relationship between the number of cases and the number of deaths and hospitalisations would also change in the next phase of the pandemic because of the impact of vaccinations. \n\"Then we will be able to accept some cases in the community without needing further restrictions,\" she added. \nDr Hopkins said measures such as the testing of pupils to find asymptomatic cases would also help to keep R \"at the lowest level possible\". \nAttendance at school will be mandatory for all pupils when they reopen in England - meaning they should not miss lessons without a valid reason. \nHowever, pupils who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a bit longer.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"very hopeful\" the reopening of schools would go to plan. \n\"I think the risk is actually in not going back to school tomorrow, given all the suffering, all the loss of learning we have seen,\" he added. \nIt is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers are at no higher risk of infection than other working-age people.\nBut what role schools will play in the wider spread of the virus remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. \nGovernment advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. \nBut this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggested reopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one, which would lead to a growing epidemic.\nMinisters have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. Only such high infection rates that risk a surge in hospitalisations that threatens the NHS is seen as a problem.\nSecondary schools have been told that year groups can return on different days over the first week to allow for Covid testing. \nSecondary pupils will be tested three times in the first two weeks of school and will then be given two tests each week to use at home. \nThese will be lateral flow tests, which involve taking a swab of the nose and throat and give a result within 30 minutes. \nAll primary and secondary school staff are also being offered twice-weekly rapid tests, and parents and carers can also get a twice-weekly test.\nHowever, concerns have been raised that false positive results could mean pupils and their families being forced to self-isolate unnecessarily. \nTests done at home require a confirmatory PCR test - which are more accurate - but Dr Hopkins said those taken at school would not because they are done in a \"specialised environment and individuals are trained to deliver it\". \nShe added that evidence from lateral flow tests taken over the last eight weeks in real-life scenarios suggested the false positive rate was \"extremely low\" - less than one in 1,000. \nMeanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) has warned that secondary schools have struggled to get parental consent for testing of pupils, and said there needed to be a bigger ministerial push to encourage take-up. \nMr Williamson said the rollout of testing in schools over the last few weeks suggested they had the \"highest take-up of any employment setting around the country\". \nThe NEU has called for a phased return to schools in England - similar to the process in Scotland and Wales, where whole year groups are returning separated by several weeks.\nThe union also accused the government of failing to put adequate safety measures in place ahead of schools reopening. \nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said schools should reopen but safety measures including adequate ventilation should have been put in place. \nHe added that it was also \"disappointing\" that teachers had not been prioritised for the coronavirus vaccine\nAs well as undergoing testing, secondary school and college students are also being asked to wear face coverings in classrooms, where social distancing cannot be maintained, with the measure to be reviewed at Easter.\nBut this is not mandatory, and in primary schools pupils are not being required to wear face coverings when they return to face-to-face lessons. Nor will they be tested.\nMr Williamson said he hoped mask-wearing would be a \"temporary measure\". \nMeanwhile, a survey has shown that the majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school.\nBut two-thirds are concerned about the amount of learning lost, with some parents worried their child will never catch up. \nThe Department for Education has announced a \u00a3700m package to help pupils catch up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools.\nThere are different rules on schools across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions.\nThe youngest pupils have already returned to school in Scotland and Wales, while some primary school pupils in Northern Ireland also return to school on Monday."

      "text": "The first minister of Wales said the prime minister \"really, really is awful\" after a meeting with Boris Johnson last year.\nMark Drakeford's comments featured in an S4C documentary, which filmed his response to the Covid pandemic.\nHe suggested he felt a \"sense of despair\" following the Cobra meeting where a lorry travel ban in France was discussed. \nThe UK government said it has confronted the virus as \"one UK\".\nSunday night's broadcast also shows the Welsh Government cabinet was split last year when it decided to go it alone by only allowing two households to meet at Christmas.\nFrance banned lorry traffic from Britain last December amid concern over a new variant of the virus found in the UK.\nOn the call, Mr Johnson can be heard to say he wants to \"urgently look at the implications of the travel bans that some of our European friends have imposed\".\nFrance later eased the measures after an agreement to have lorry drivers tested. Travel bans were also implemented by other nations.\nThe programme cuts away from most of the meeting, saying it cannot record it for security reasons.\nBut Mr Drakeford is then heard to say: \"Dear me, he really, really is awful.\n\"Imagine that some deadly new variant of the virus had been discovered in France and they were trying to persuade us that there was no need to take any action to stop French lorry drivers from driving across the continent.\"\nWhen asked by an adviser whether he wanted any minutes from the meeting, Mr Drakeford said: \"No, I don't think there is anything at all, other than wringing our hands, a sense of despair.\"\nEarlier in the programme, he said he and the PM were \"very different people\".\nThey had both studied Latin \"but it's hard to find anything else that's common between us as people\", he added.\n\"The world through Boris Johnson's eyes is so different to the world that people in Wales see. It's difficult sometimes to understand where he's coming from and why he's doing what he's doing.\"\nIn response, a UK government spokesman said: \"Now more than ever, the people of the United Kingdom want to see all parts of the country working together to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\"We have confronted this virus as one UK, working closely with the devolved administrations, including the Welsh Government. This will continue as we move to build back better together.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"This type of rhetoric might play well with the nationalists ahead of Senedd coalition talks, but I'm not sure this is a good look for Labour's first minister.\"\n\"While the first minister might not like the rosette on the prime minister's lapel, he should respect the office.\"\nThe documentary shows the decision-making behind the Welsh Government's move to allow only two households to mix over Christmas.\nIt was due to be three, under the four nations' agreement, but Mr Drakeford changed the policy in Wales at a press conference in December. \nWhen announced, it was unclear if it would be guidance or an enforceable law, but the programme shows the first minister initially supported doing the former.\nAppearing to speak about the media, the first minister said: \"Let's hope nobody is bright enough to ask, 'is that 'should' as in regulation or 'should' as in advice'?\"\n\"They are asking already,\" an official said, to which Mr Drakeford swears in response.\nThe documentary goes on to show the proceedings of a later cabinet meeting, where ministers were split on whether to make the rule legally enforceable.\nFour of those present - including Health Minister Vaughan Gething - supported making it law, while four others were opposed.\n\"Our rates are materially different,\" Mr Gething said at the time, \"and at such a high level that I think we need to change the law\".\nJane Hutt and Dafydd Elis-Thomas were among those who wanted to stick with the four nations' approach.\nAt the end of the discussion, Mr Drakeford decided to go ahead putting the guidance into regulations, although he said he did so reluctantly.\nThe film also shows that the first minister felt it would have been unaffordable if last year's short autumn lockdown had gone on for three weeks.\nKnown as the firebreak, the two week break began at the end of October and lasted into November.\nLee Waters, deputy minister for the economy, is shown asking colleagues to consider a three-week firebreak.\n\"I simply don't think a three-week firebreak is affordable, let alone sustainable in the public mind,\" Mr Drakeford said.\n\"A three working week firebreak is a completely different proposition in terms of its impact on businesses and our ability to be able to support those businesses.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Deliveroo",
      "text": "\"I never set out to be a founder or a CEO.  I was never into start-ups,\" says Will Shu, founder of food delivery chain, Deliveroo.\nHis comments came as the firm set out plans to issue shares to the public which could value it at about \u00a37bn.\nDeliveroo has not yet made a profit and it reported a \u00a3223.7m loss for last year, despite a surge in sales.\nThe float will see the busiest riders share in a \u00a316m fund, and customers will also get the chance to buy shares. \nDeliveroo is making \u00a350m worth of shares available to customers who will be given the opportunity to buy up to \u00a31,000 worth of shares each, although if demand is high they may see their orders scaled back.\nMr Shu's letter, contained in the official notice of the intention to float, also says: \"I'm not one of those Silicon Valley types with a million ideas. I had one idea.\n\"At the end of the day, I started the business because I wanted something better than what was available to me.\n\"Today, the business is so, so much bigger than I ever would have thought possible.\"\nDeliveroo said that last year, its gross transaction value - the total amount of transactions it processes on its platform - jumped by 64.3% to \u00a34.1bn from \u00a32.5bn in 2019.\nHowever, the business remains loss-making, although its underlying loss for 2020 reduced to \u00a3223.7m from \u00a3317.3m in 2019.\nDemand for takeaway meals has soared during the coronavirus pandemic, after lockdown measures were first implemented a year ago and restaurants have been forced to close.  \nRestrictions on hospitality businesses in England are currently set to start to ease on 12 April at the earliest.\nAnna Macdonald, fund manager at Amati Global Investors, told the BBC's Today programme: \"Losses have actually been mounting at Deliveroo over the last few years, but given the environment for tech listings at the moment, that doesn't seem to put too many investors off who are prescribing quite a hefty valuation for the company.\n\"There's no doubt that it's done tremendously well during lockdown and the founder Will Shu says in the last six months to the end of 2020 it was operating profitably. But, yes, there's a good deal of hope in the share price valuation.\"\nAs part of the flotation, riders in Deliveroo's 12 markets who have worked with the firm for at least a year will be paid a bonus of either \u00a310,000, \u00a31,000, \u00a3500 and \u00a3200 depending on the number of orders they have delivered.\nHow can a company that lost over \u00a3200m in a year when trading conditions could not have been more favourable be worth so many billions?\nThat's the question many will be asking when trying to work out why Deliveroo is expected to hit that valuation when it makes its stock market debut in London. \nThe answer, of course, is that stock markets are all about pricing future profits, or at least in Deliveroo's case, the hope of future profits. The online food delivery service has grown quickly during the pandemic - sales last year were more than \u00a34bn, nearly two-thirds up on 2019 - and it has been able to reduce its annual loss.\nIt is also investing heavily in technology and geographical expansion, and is eager to show investors that it has now honed its model and operating systems to the point that they can be quickly introduced into many more markets. \nThis promise of rapid growth and eventual bumper profits is what will drive Deliveroo's share price when it eventually comes to market. The challenge for its management team, led by founder Will Shu, is turning the promise into reality.\nThe shares will be listed on the London Stock Exchange, where Will Shu is planning to maintain a firmer grip on how the company is run than has been traditional for London-listed companies.\nUnder a proposed dual-class share structure, each share Mr Shu will hold will carry 20 times the voting power of ordinary shares. \nA recent government-commissioned review of the UK's listing rules recommended a number of measures to make the country a more attractive place for companies to float.\nThe review, led by former European Commissioner Lord Hill, recommended allowing companies with dual-class share structures  to be allowed in the premium listing segment of the London Stock Exchange, which allows them to be included in FTSE indexes. A decision on any changes to the current system will be made by the Financial Conduct Authority but will not come until the end of this year. \nMajor tech companies such as Facebook and Google-owner Alphabet have so-called dual-class shares. \nSusannah Streeter, share analyst for stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said that because of the proposed dual-class share structure, people \"need to be aware if they invest under these terms they don't have the same voting rights as they would do if they owned shares in other companies listed on the London market\".\nShe added that there were other factors for potential investors to consider.\n\"Competition in the sector is fierce, and Deliveroo competes with Uber Eats, Just Eat and a host of others,\" she said.\n\"Profitability can be tough and margins tend to be slim thanks to competition and high variable costs.\n\"There is of course a risk that demand for home deliveries will wane once the pandemic has eased. It's likely that the public will be desperate to eat out as soon as they can.\""

And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less. \n\"So we could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens.\" \nDr Hopkins said her role as a government advisor was to \"prepare for worst-case scenarios\". \n\"It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,\" she said.\nDuring last year's winter, some 30 million people - more than ever before - were invited to get a free flu jab as ministers feared the dual threat it posed alongside coronavirus.\nFlu can be a serious condition - it kills around 11,000 people in England each year and many more people receive hospital treatment for it.\nPeople at high risk from flu are also most at risk from Covid-19.\nFlu poses additional threats during the Covid pandemic because:\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap out of national lockdown aims for all coronavirus restrictions to be lifted by 21 June at the earliest.\nBut top scientists and medics have warned that restrictions to curb Covid infections could continue into next winter.\nMask-wearing and working from home could be among \"baseline\" measures expected to continue until then, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex",
      "text": "Traditionally the Palace protects the family by drawing a curtain between the public, formal stuff and the personal stuff; its refusal to comment on the personal is a strategic interpretation of the family's maxim - \"never explain, never complain\".\nThe public/personal divide has always been an artifice. Royals get married in front of tens of millions of people, have state funerals, release photos on birthdays and anniversaries, exchange insights into their lives in return for easy-going and generous coverage.\nBut the divide, however often disregarded, remains the guiding principle of the family's formal relationship with the outside world. Now the contradictions that spring from the mix of personal and public are playing out.\nSome key allegations are about the personal behaviour and comments of members of the Royal Family and how, through collective neglect and perhaps some malicious intent, they left Harry and Meghan no choice but to leave.\nOther statements painted a terrible portrait of unfeeling staff and courtiers. The entire institution was portrayed as if nothing had been learnt from the days of Diana - Prince Harry and Prince William's late mother.\nThe duchess is a formidable communicator and has proved herself a very bad woman to pick a fight with. A newly-liberated Harry spoke with almost-eloquence. \nMeghan dealt some of the heaviest blows. What is the Palace to say about the accusation that an unnamed member of the family made a comment - more than one by the sounds of things - about the skin colour of the couple's child-to-be? The mind boggles.\nBut alongside the personal pain and anger rippling through the duchess's testimony, there came from Harry condemnation of the institution - the suggestion that it was incapable of change, incapable of love, incapable of understanding.\nThe contradictions of the Palace, and of the monarchy, are exactly that which makes it so special, so strange, so interesting and so difficult to work within - the merging of personal and public roles, the accretion of tradition, the mix of public accountability, ceaseless media interest and the need to remain relevant.\nHarry's suggestion that his family too - his father Prince Charles, his brother Prince William - are \"trapped\" in their world, and that he felt \"compassion\" for them, was a velvet-covered knife into the heart of the modern monarchy.  \nRoyal life is conducted from within a gilded cage; the players are not meant to rattle the bars from the outside. \nThese are the contradictions Harry walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. He was uncomfortable with them before he was married. And when he saw his wife suffering as a result of his being \"trapped\" in royal life, he found a way out with her.\nThere are also the contradictions that lie behind many of the decisions that they both spoke out about and are clearly very unhappy about.\nIt is public money that pays for security. It is tradition that dictates who gets what title. There is no HR department for working royals because it is a family affair. What you do in front of the cameras matters because it reflects on the institution as a whole. \nThis meshing of personal and public is unique. It is what being a modern royal is all about. And inside it is often a hugely uncomfortable place to be. Harry knew that. Presumably he warned Meghan. But that warning wasn't enough. \nHarry and Meghan's experience suggests that the contradictions are too great. Maybe their interview will act as a catalyst for change. But the Crown has been around for a very long time, and change does not come easily to a body in which the past plays such an outsize role."

      "text": "A US judge has delayed jury selection in the case of an ex-Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May.\nDerek Chauvin faces murder charges for kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for over seven minutes in a widely-viewed video that sparked protests worldwide.\nThe delay came as the judge awaits an appeals court decision on whether a new murder charge can be added.\nJury selection is expected to resume on Tuesday morning.\nMr Chauvin is accused of second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter in the 25 May death of Mr Floyd. The maximum sentence he faces is 40 years.\nThe less severe charge of third-degree murder was initially dismissed last year, but prosecutors have requested to reinstate it.\nLegal experts say that adding a third-degree charge could make it easier for prosecutors to get a conviction.\nJury selection is expected to take about three weeks, with trial arguments due to begin on 29 March.\nMore than 370 potential witnesses could be called to testify.\nThe judge's decision followed prosecutors saying they would ask the appeals court to delay proceedings as the panel weighs whether the third-degree murder charge can be brought against Mr Chauvin.\nHennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill said it was unlikely the appeals panel would respond before Tuesday.\n\"So unless any of the parties object I'm going to kick our jurors loose and start everything tomorrow with jury selection,\" the judge said.\nTo prove second-degree murder, prosecutors must convince jurors that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \"substantial causal factor\" in Mr Floyd's death.\nThird-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life.\nLawyers for Mr Chauvin said they would ask the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the court of appeals decision, which could lead to further delays.\nMr Chauvin, who was fired from the Minneapolis police force and is currently free on a $1m (\u00a3725,000) bail, wore a blue suit and tie to court, as well as a black face mask. He took notes on a yellow legal pad during the hearing.\nThe death of Mr Floyd sparked racial justice protests around the world. Most demonstrations were peaceful, though some turned violent.\nThe trial, which is the fourth involving the killing of a civilian by a police officer in modern Minnesota history, has been highly anticipated.\nBarricades, fencing and barbed wire surround the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis as police brace for protests.\nOn Monday, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the city. Marches also occurred over the weekend.\nThree other ex-officers who were involved in Mr Floyd's arrest are due to stand trial together later this year.\nAnalysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Minneapolis\nBarbed wire surrounds the courthouse, and Forest McClarron, 34, an army veteran, walks past, looking up at the building.  \nHe lives on Chicago Avenue, where George Floyd was pinned to the ground. \n\"I hope they find unbiased people,\" McClarron says, referring to the jury selection process. \"Just honest, unbiased people.\" \nNear him a woman walks with her husband to a vehicle parked on South Third Avenue. He has an assault rifle, and a paper cup sits on the bonnet of the vehicle. \nHe works in private security, and they are here to keep activists safe \"from white supremacists,\" they say.  \nThe mood is calm and the street smells like cannabis while people wait to see what happens with the jury, and with those who have gathered outside the courthouse. \nA jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected by lawyers for each side from a pool of eligible local citizens.\nEach potential juror has filled in a 16-page questionnaire, which asks about news viewing habits, how many times they watched the video of Mr Floyd's arrest, belief in the US criminal justice system, and other questions related to the case.\nIn cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived.\nThe 46-year-old was arrested outside a convenience store on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill.\nOfficers arrived and handcuffed him, but when they tried to put him into the squad car he resisted and a struggle ended with Mr\u00a0Floyd\u00a0face down on the street.\nMr Chauvin, 44, placed his left knee between Mr\u00a0Floyd's head and neck, and kept it there for seven minutes and 46 seconds, according to prosecutors. Two other officers helped pin him down, while another prevented witnesses from intervening.\nMr\u00a0Floyd\u00a0said he could not breathe more than 20 times. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.\nHe was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later."

Our boys will continue to make you proud and you will forever live on through them. \n\"Daddy, we are not ready to say goodbye just yet so until we meet again, we love you always.

Rest in peace my son, you will always be my little boy.\"\nSgt Hillier's platoon commander said his style of leadership \"got the best out of the platoon\" and his personality was \"infectious\". \nHe added: \"He was my rock when I needed guidance, never afraid to offer me advice and was a fierce Welshman.\"\nOn Saturday, Dyfed-Powys Police said it had opened an investigation into the death of the soldier. \nPolice said officers were liaising with the Health and Safety Executive and the Ministry of Defence.\nThe Defence Accident Investigation Branch is also involved in inquiries.\nSgt Hillier is the fourth soldier to die at Castlemartin since 2012.

      "text": "There has been a \"catastrophic failure of governance\" at Swansea University, according to a dismissed academic cleared of criminal wrongdoing.\nProf Marc Clement was sacked for gross misconduct, with bribery allegations reported to police.\nDetectives told the BBC they sent a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which concluded it was \"not in the public interest\" to proceed.\nThe university said its disciplinary investigation was a separate matter. \n\"The criminal investigation and the university's internal disciplinary processes are and have always been entirely separate,\" said a Swansea University official.\nThe allegations were made in relation to a \u00a3200m wellness village that was planned in Llanelli.\nPolice concluded that \"the correct procurement guidelines were followed and overseen by specialist law firms\".\nIt is not known whether the CPS made the decision not to proceed because of a lack of sufficient evidence or on different grounds. The service has been asked to comment.\nProf Clement welcomed the decision by police, saying that he had not had \"a good night's rest\" throughout the months of the investigation.\nHe was accused by Swansea University of being in line to personally profit from the wellness village project.\nThe former dean of the school of management was dismissed along with a colleague, Steve Poole.\nAnother member of staff, Bjorn Rodde, resigned from the university.\nThe former vice-chancellor Prof Richard Davies was also dismissed for gross misconduct and gross negligence, following a disciplinary process by the university.\nProfessor Davies was not part of the police investigation.\nThe four have taken a case against Swansea University to an employment tribunal but it has been delayed due to the police investigation and the Covid pandemic. \nThe university claimed the dismissals were for \"serious breaches of the university's procedures, and not for a finding of criminal conduct\" and said the decision by the CPS has \"no bearing on this whatsoever\".\n\"Swansea University dismissed Marc Clement in July 2019, following a detailed and thorough independent investigation which found evidence that he had significant undeclared interests worth millions of pounds,\" it added.  \nProf Clement said the events showed \"a catastrophic failure of governance on behalf of Swansea University, allowing one or a small number of executives to lead the university into this situation and spend enormous amounts of money, public money from a charitable institution, on Europe's most expensive legal advisors, leading to an outcome, where Tarian, the regional Organised Crime Unit, have decided that they don't want to take things further\".\nHe added he was disappointed the wellness village project in Llanelli had stalled.\n\"My overwhelming emotion is the sadness about the catastrophic loss of opportunity for the people of south-west Wales, who I think are the true victims here. There's been huge injustice,\" said Prof Clement.\nHe argued that the project had attracted some of the world's biggest companies including Pfizer and Siemens.\n\"In the spring of 2021, which is where we now are, there would have been 1000 high added value jobs in Llanelli, an area of deprivation,\" he added."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,David Frost,Brexit",
      "text": "The UK's lead Brexit minister has called on the EU to \"shake off any remaining ill will\" over the UK's decision to leave the organisation. \nLord Frost said the EU's previous threat to block vaccine exports had \"significantly undermined\" post-Brexit measures in Northern Ireland.\nHe insisted the UK's unilateral move to extend grace periods on border checks was legal under the Brexit trade deal. \nThe EU disputes this, and is preparing to launch a legal challenge. \nThe UK has said it will delay new checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, agreed as part of the UK's withdrawal deal. \nEU Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has called it a \"violation\" of the part of the deal relating to Northern Ireland and said legal action was imminent.\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Lord Frost insisted the delayed border checks was a \"temporary\" measure justified to implement the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol. \nThe Cabinet Office minister added that the measures were justified by the \"fragile\" situation in Northern Ireland.\n\"They are about protecting the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland, making sure they can receive parcels and buy the usual groceries from the supermarket.\n\"Without this threat of disruption, we can continue our discussions with the EU to resolve difficulties arising from the Protocol constructively,\" he added. \nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods, so products arriving from Great Britain have to undergo EU import procedures.\nBoth sides agreed the arrangement as part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, to avoid the need for border checks between NI and the Republic of Ireland. \nBut it has led to disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, increasing tensions with the EU. \nEarlier this week, the UK extended a grace period on new checks on food products from the end of March to October, without the prior agreement of the EU.\nIt then delayed the introduction of similar checks on parcels, which had been due to come in on 1 April, until the same month. \nThe logistics industry had said it was not ready to deal with that volume of new administration. The grace periods mean procedures will not yet be fully applied.\nLord Frost, who negotiated the UK's Brexit trade deal with the EU, said he wanted to work with the EU towards \"common goals\" after the UK formally cut legal ties at the end of the Brexit transition earlier this year. \n\"I hope they will shake off any remaining ill will towards us for leaving, and instead build a friendly relationship, between sovereign equals,\" he added. \nBut Labour has said the UK's actions risk \"plunging Northern Ireland into further instability\". \nThe party's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said it could mark out the region as \"the arena for wider UK-EU conflict for years to come\".\nAnd Lord Frost has been accused by a former senior civil servant of \"burning trust\" with the EU by \"playing hard ball\" over the protocol.\nPhilip Rycroft, who led the Department for Exiting the EU between 2017 and 2019, told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour while there were issues around the protocol it was the \"least-worst option\" and had to be made to work. \n\"Traders simply aren't ready to do the things that are required on the protocol, not least because the government spent the best part of last year saying to them they wouldn't have to do anything, despite knowing full well that all of these checks would have to come in,\" he said. \n\"Extending those grace periods is not an unreasonable thing to ask for,\" he added. \n\"But the way that David Frost has gone about this, to tell the Commission he was unilaterally extending without doing his opposite number in the Commission the courtesy of picking up the phone, suggests that they're still playing games around Brexit.\n\"It is so important to the peace process in Northern Ireland that this protocol is able to work and that's going to require a huge amount of goodwill and trust on both sides.\""

      "text": "Both Covid-19 case rates and positivity rates for Wales have now fallen below \"trigger\" figures used for putting areas into lockdown restrictions.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has said stay at home rules could be revised when lockdown measures are reviewed this week and announced on Friday.\nIt comes as health chiefs reported no Covid deaths in Wales on Monday.\nWales' overall Covid case rate is 45 cases per 100,000 people for the last week - below the 50 cases threshold.\nThe proportion of Covid tests coming back positive has also fallen below a 5% threshold for the first time since September.\nBut Public Health Wales warned of a possible lag in reporting deaths, especially after the weekend, for the zero daily figure - which has not been that low since September.\nDr Giri Shankar, incident director for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak response at Public Health Wales, added the dashboard is designed to be a \"rapid reporting tool which is subject to ongoing reconciliation\" and that \"official data is provided by the Office for National Statistics\".\nThe overall case rate for Wales is at its lowest point since 18 September.\nThe figure of 50 cases per 100,000 is seen as a so-called \"circuit breaker\" for bringing in restrictions and so getting areas below it, a sign-post on the road out of lockdown.\nThere are now 15 of Wales' 22 local authority areas under this figure.\nGwynedd remains the local authority with the highest case rate for a seven day period - 77.1 cases per 100,000 people.\nThis is followed by Merthyr Tydfil (72.9) and Anglesey (72.8).\nThe lowest case rates are seen in the Vale of Glamorgan (23.2), Pembrokeshire (17.5) and Ceredigion (15.1).\nThe proportion of tests which are positive is 4.8% in Wales, the lowest point since 23 September.\nThe World Health Organisation suggests a 5% threshold, which needs to be sustained, as part of requirements to come out of restrictions.\nThere are now 13 local authority areas below 5% - with Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Vale of Glamorgan below 3%.\nThere were no further deaths reported on Monday, leaving the total so far during the pandemic involving lab-tested cases, at 5,403.\nIt is advised to look at the rolling 7-day daily average for deaths as reported by Public Health Wales and account for the lag in reporting, so waiting until we know when the deaths occurred.\nBy 3 March, there was an average of nine deaths a day - this is the lowest number since 24 October.  \nIt is down from a peak of 47 daily deaths on 3 January. There were 57 deaths occurring on 1 January, the highest daily figure in the pandemic.\nA total of 998,296 people have now received at least a first dose of a Covid vaccine in Wales.\nOf those, 183,739 have had their second jab.\nDr Giri Shankar said: \"The Welsh Government has announced that the revised vaccine strategy will mean that every eligible adult in Wales will be offered a first dose by the end of July. \n\"In addition, adults with severe or profound learning disabilities, and those with any mental illness that causes severe functional impairment, will be invited for vaccination as part of the JCVI priority group six, and the Welsh Government has published guidance on identifying eligible individuals in these groups and how to support them to take up their vaccine offers.\n\"We encourage everyone, whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity, to have the vaccine when they are offered it.\n\"We also stress the importance of seeking information from a trusted source such as Public Health Wales, the Welsh Government, local health board or GP.\"\nThe latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show Covid was mentioned on 7,458 death certificates, up to 19 February.\nThis gives a bigger picture and includes deaths where Covid is either confirmed or suspected by doctors and covers deaths in all settings, including care homes, hospices and people's homes.\nThe ONS figures show the weekly total has fallen for the fifth successive week.\nWhen looking at the number of all deaths and comparing them over a period of five non-pandemic years to what we might normally expect to see, this shows 5,411 deaths above the average.\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils. In England, data for county councils has been replaced with data for district councils. Figures for boroughs and unitary authorities remain unchanged. \nPHW figures only record deaths which have a confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis, backed up by a laboratory test, and mostly involve hospital deaths.\nONS takes a little longer to report deaths because it collates details of death registrations. In about 90% of cases, it is the underlying cause of death."

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silent if it was \"perpetuating falsehoods about us\". \nIn a clip of Oprah Winfrey's interview with the couple, Meghan had been asked how she felt about the palace hearing her \"speak your truth today\".\nMeghan also said: \"If that comes with risk of losing things, I mean... there is a lot that has been lost already.\"\nBuckingham Palace is investigating claims the duchess bullied royal staff.\nThe allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan were published after the interview with Oprah was recorded.\nThe interview with Oprah, which will air in the US on Sunday and in the UK on Monday, is expected to detail Harry and Meghan's short period as working royals together before they stepped down for a life in the US.\nIn the 30-second teaser clip released by CBS, Oprah asks the duchess: \"How do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today?\"\nMeghan replies: \"I don't know how they could expect that, after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.\"\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. \nA report in the Times newspaper on Wednesday claimed the duchess faced a complaint made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace after their marriage in May of that year.\nA leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff.\nIn a statement later, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said it was \"clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times\" and its HR team would look into the circumstances outlined in the article. \n\"The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace.\"\nIf anyone thought Prince Harry and Meghan were going to restrict their criticism to the British media, a sector they have made clear they loathe, they should think again. \"The Firm\" - aka the Royal Family and its staff - is clearly in their sights.\nThis isn't directly about the allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan, and also to a lesser degree Harry. They were published after the interview was recorded. But the couple see the allegations as an example of how some people in the palace brief against them.\nWe'll have to wait for the interview to find out exactly what \"falsehoods\" the couple believe have been put out by the palace. The bullying allegations - which are vigorously denied by the couple - are being investigated.  \nBut it's clear that the gloves have come off, and that the ties of family have not restrained the couple as they seek to put their side of the story.\nPast and present royal employees are to be invited to speak in confidence about their experiences of working for Meghan as part of the investigation.\nThe bullying allegations are denied by Meghan and Prince Harry.\nA statement issued by Meghan's spokesman in response to the newspaper's story said: \"The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma.\n\"She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.\"\nAuthor Anna Pasternak - who wrote a book on Princess Diana - said she thought \"the whole issue stems to when Meghan first entered the Royal Family\".\n\"I think she was na\u00efve, she didn't really understand the monarchy or 'The Firm' as she rightly puts it, and the constricts of royal power. She was naive to think that she could modernise the monarchy, that she could have her voice and could do things her way,\" she told Radio 5 Live.\nBut Rachel C. Boyle, head of interdisciplinary studies at Leeds Beckett University, said the Oprah interview was \"absolutely the right thing to do at this point\".\n\"I feel like Meghan has not been given the opportunity to defend herself or to respond to any of the claims that have previously been made about her in the media, in a space that allows her to express herself.\"\nMeghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March.\nIn the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March.\nCBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\".\nShe will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.\nIn an earlier clip released by CBS, the Duke of Sussex drew parallels between the treatment of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Meghan.\nJust hours before the interview is aired in the US, a special programme to celebrate Commonwealth Day will be broadcast on BBC One at 17:00 on Sunday 7 March.\nIt comes as Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of Edinburgh has undergone a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition and will be remaining in hospital for a number of days."

      "text": "The first day back at school for millions of children in England has \"gone well\", say head teachers.\nThey are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms.\nPrimary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described it as a \"big day and an emotional day\" for families.\nAt a Downing Street press conference he thanked parents for teaching their children at home: \"We all know that the burden has disproportionately fallen on women - often holding down jobs and providing childcare at the same time.\"\nThe latest coronavirus figures for the UK show:\nAfter more than two months of studying at home, pupils have gone back to the classroom - and an instant survey from the ASCL head teachers' union suggests attendance levels are \"good\" and Covid testing is going ahead as planned.\nThe snapshot of more than 700 secondary schools found take-up of Covid tests as being between 90% to 100% in more than half of schools, between 80% and 90% in a quarter. But in about one in 20 schools, take-up for testing was below 60% of pupils.\nThe Covid tests, with swabs of nose and throat, are voluntary - and there had been warnings that getting parental consent had been the biggest difficulty.\nSecondary pupils are asked to take three tests in school before switching to being tested twice a week at home.\nHead teachers also reported that in nearly three quarters of secondary schools, 90% of pupils were complying with wearing face masks in classrooms, where social distancing is not possible.\n\"These early indications are very encouraging,\" said ASCL leader Geoff Barton.\nAlthough \"strongly recommended\" by the government, it is not compulsory for pupils to wear masks.\nChildren's Minister Vicky Ford said some students might be \"very anxious and nervous\" about them.\nThis fourth big return to school in England since the start of the pandemic comes with questions about catching up on missed lessons, young people's wellbeing and a replacement exam system.\nThe government is considering measures to help pupils, including longer school days and shorter holidays, according to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, visiting a school in East London, said \"the government may need to look more closely at testing arrangements as they're rolled out\" to avoid \"lots of groups or classes having to self-isolate\".\nAt Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London, pupils were returning on Monday morning with a mixture of excitement and nervousness, reports Jeanette Long.\nTomisin, 15, told the BBC: \"I just know that I'm ready for school, because it's been quite a long time being at home doing online school. It's nice to see my friends and people that I used to talk to a lot.\"\nTomisin feels she has missed some parts of her learning, but is \"just hoping I can do my best\" in upcoming tests.\nJoseph, 15, says he is glad to get back to school as it will be easier to work than at home: \"The telly, phone, family - it's really easy to get distracted.\n\"At home I've been able to do all my assignments, but there are a lot of distractions.\"\nBut he was a bit nervous about taking a Covid test: \"The whole process is a bit nerve-racking.\"\nVic, 15, is also glad to be back in school: \"I am very excited to be back, but there obviously is that bit of nervousness. But I feel safe and I know that the school will put my best interests first.\"\nShe says wearing a mask can be difficult but accepts the new guidelines.\n\"It is tricky because you want to take it off and you want to be able to get a bit of ventilation  and you want to be able to talk to the teacher without having to think about the mask. \n\"But, if we've got to do it then we've got to do it - it's the guidelines so we've got to just abide by it.\"\nVic's mother Alison says the school has done everything it can to make the premises safe.\n\"So I'm happy that's she's happy and is ready to return - I think we all need a little bit of normality back in our lives and a bit of routine, so it's good that we've got to this stage I think.\"\nJules White, head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham, West Sussex, said the return brought a mix of \"immense relief tied to a little apprehension\" and meeting friends would be as important for pupils as getting back to learning.\nIn his school of 1,500 pupils, testing began last week and the phased return will stretch into next week.\nRyedale School in Nawton, North Yorkshire, tested all its pupils last week and all year groups will return to face-to-face teaching from Monday.\nPrimary schools have opened for all pupils - but they will not have to take Covid tests or wear masks.\nThe challenge is to \"support pupils socially and emotionally, not just academically\", said Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has said \"everything is strongly in favour\" of pupils returning to school - with extra safety measures in place, such as testing, the wider use of masks and an early \"natural firebreak\" of the Easter holidays.\nA survey of 6,000 parents from the Institute for Fiscal Studies found widespread support for the return to school - with nine in 10 saying they would have sent their children back even if it had not been compulsory.\nBut two-thirds of parents were \"concerned that their child has lost out on learning\".\nBut for many pupils, apart from one day in January before the lockdown, this will be the first week back in school this year.\nThe ambition is that this fourth return - following the short-lived attempt in January and returns last June and September - will be the last needed.\nThe government has appointed Sir Kevan Collins as an \"education recovery commissioner\", who will begin the process of helping pupils make up for the disruption and lost time in school.\nThe latest lockdown has seen the cancellation of A-level, GCSE and vocational exams, and pupils will return to study for a new system based on teachers' grades.\nOfsted inspectors have warned that disadvantaged children are more likely to have been adversely affected - and the government has announced \u00a31.7bn to support catch-up schemes, such as tutoring and summer clubs.\nThere have been concerns about children's mental health during the pandemic - and a study by researchers at the universities of Essex, Surrey and Birmingham reports a \"significant rise in emotional and behavioural difficulties\".\nEngland's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the return to school would be a \"moment of joy\" when students would get back to their teachers and friends.\n\"I do not underestimate how challenging the last few months have been with some children in class and most at home, but I do know how important it is for all children to be back in school, not only for their education but for their mental health and wellbeing,\" said Mr Williamson."

So I was just really wishing her good luck with the flight.\"\nThat was the last time he saw his wife in person.\nNazanin was arrested by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard at Tehran Airport as she prepared to fly home. \nSince then, she's endured eight months of solitary confinement, blindfolded interrogations, hunger strikes to press for medical treatment, false promises of release, and almost five years of separation from her family.\n\"At the beginning, I just thought that this was so profoundly unfair that if we just shouted it from the rooftops, the right people would intervene and it would get sorted,\" Mr Ratcliffe told me. \"Never in my imagination did I think this would take five years or more.\" \nHe adds: \"Now the end of her actual sentence - which was once the worst-case scenario - looks like a good outcome, at this point.\"\nAt a secret trial in 2016, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail for \"membership of organisations working against the Iranian state\" - a reference, her husband says, to her work for the charities BBC Media Action and the Thomson Reuters Foundation. And no, she wasn't training journalists at the time of her arrest. \nSunday 7 March is the official date of her release - her lawyer has seen it marked in the computer of the Iranian judiciary. She's been counting down the weeks on a calendar at her parents' home, where she is now under house arrest with an ankle tag.  \nBut her husband - who has fought an extraordinary, high-profile campaign for her release - doubts that she will be allowed to fly home.\nHe describes his wife as a hostage - used as a bargaining chip over a long-standing debt that Britain owes Iran for a tank deal that was never fulfilled. \n\"The Revolutionary Guard have been completely consistent over the past five years - that they arrested Nazanin as leverage for the tank debt,\" says Mr Ratcliffe. \n\"They've held her all the time that it's not being paid. And I think that if the tank debt is not paid, not only will Nazanin and other dual nationals continue to be held but more collateral will be taken.\"\nHer case may also be caught up in negotiations over Iran's nuclear deal, the JCPOA, which the UK is working with European allies to revive.\n\"There's the potential for this to drag on and on,\" says Mr Ratcliffe. \"It's perfectly possible that Nazanin gets a new court case thrown at her. \n\"The family have never seen a copy of the charges on which she was sentenced. There is no written documentation on anything.  So they preserve the space to make it up as they go along at every stage.\"\nHe worries about the impact that any prolongation of the family's separation will have on both his wife and Gabriella, now six, who has also been counting down the days until her mother's release - on a calendar she made herself.   \nShe returned to the UK to live with her father and start school in October 2019, hoping that her mother would soon follow behind.   \n\"Gabriella has been promised so many times that 'Mummy is coming home soon,'\" says her father. \nThe darkest period for Nazanin herself came in 2016, when she was held alone in a dark room, incommunicado. Her interrogators told her, wrongly, that Richard was having affairs and that they had photographic evidence. \n\"I don't think I can possibly understand what she's gone through,\" Mr Ratcliffe says.\n\"It's a very practised technique of really breaking someone. That fear and abuse led her to feel suicidal. She said to me: 'It would be better if I just died and you could get on with your lives.'\"\nIn her first letter from jail to her husband, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote in despair: \"Every day and every second I would submerge more and more in an ocean of doubt, fear, threat, loneliness... my wails would go unheard in that tiny, dingy, cold, grey cell.\" \nBeing parted from her daughter for so long has been a source of agony and guilt.   \nShe apologised to her daughter from jail, saying: \"Forgive me for all the nights I was not by your side to hold your warm, little hand till you fall asleep. \n\"Forgive me for all those moments you missed the bosom of your mother, for all those teething fever nights that I was not there for you; forgive me.\"\nSeparated by thousands of miles, the family now speaks twice a day over Skype. \nMs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is now 42, watches Gabriella draw and they play games together. \nGabriella looks forward to swimming with her mother, and going to a toy shop - one day.\nThe couple hope to have another child, but fear that time may now be against them.\nLate last month, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, phoned Ms Zahari-Ratcliffe in Tehran, reassuring her that the government is doing all it can to bring her home, but managing expectations of an imminent release.\nThe Foreign Office says that she and other dual British-Iranian nationals are \"arbitrarily detained\" by the Iranian government.  It adds: \"We do not accept Iran detaining dual nationals as diplomatic leverage.\"\nBut Mr Ratcliffe has been critical of the UK government's approach. \n\"Not to do anything that's going to rock the boat means there's no cost whatsoever to the hostage takers to continue the practice and to continue to wait,\" he says. \n\"And so both sides can wait each other out because they're not the ones bearing the cost of the waiting - whereas the victim and the family certainly are.\"\nAs for what might happen on Sunday and over the next few months, Richard says, stoically:  \"Fate will deal us the hand it deals us. But one day the sun will come.\""

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,United States",
      "text": "US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has made a blunt new push for a UN-led peace effort in Afghanistan.\nIn a letter to the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Mr Blinken called for a 90-day reduction in violence and a transitional government formed from both sides.\nMr Blinken also said no decision had been made about whether to stick to a planned US troop withdrawal by 1 May.\nHe called on President Ghani to show \"urgent leadership\".\nMr Blinken's letter, a copy of which was obtained by the BBC on Sunday, reflected the difficult position the US finds itself in as it reviews whether to withdraw its last 2,500 troops.\nA deal struck with the Taliban during the Trump administration in February 2020 committed the US to withdrawing by 1 May, but Afghan officials fear the move would create enormous security challenges.\nMr Blinken warned in his letter that the Taliban could make \"rapid territorial gains\" across the country in a \"spring offensive\".\nHe also proposed a \"transitional peace government\" to usher the country through this precarious period, followed by national elections, as well as a UN-led peace conference in Turkey attended by foreign ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the US.\nThe BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, describes the letter to President Ghani as \"blunt\" and as an effort to \"step up the pressure\" on the Afghan government and the Taliban.\nHowever, the disagreement and distrust between the two sides is still wide and Afghans worry that a deal brokered in haste could quickly break down, our correspondent adds.\nUS-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001, shortly after the 11 September terror attacks. \nThe level of violence in the country remains high. The past year has seen a surge in targeted killings of journalists, activists, judges, and other civil society figures - killings blamed largely on the Taliban.\nThe planned US and Nato withdrawal has led to fears, particularly among women's rights activists, that a Taliban return to power could compromise the progress made over the past two decades.\nZalmay Khalilzad, the US diplomat spearheading the current intra-Afghan peace process, will meet Pakistani officials on Monday in Pakistan, which is widely viewed as having leverage over the Taliban.\nMonths of silence and speculation over President Biden's agenda for Afghanistan have been shattered by this leaked letter. It underscores how the Afghan leader, President Ghani, is being consulted much more than he was in the time of President Trump. But it's also clear much more is now expected of Mr Ghani - urgently. \nAnthony Blinken's letter is respectful to a \"partner\", but also surprisingly blunt to a leader who could pose an obstacle with his insistence on only transferring power through elections. Mr Blinken tries to burst any bubbles in Kabul: once the last US troops leave, the Taliban could make even greater gains on the ground, he warns.\nWashington's plans are now clear: it wants to accelerate on-off Taliban peace talks in the Gulf state of Qatar, as well as endless efforts to get Afghanistan's neighbours, with their own conflicting agendas, on the same page. \nZalmay Khalilzad, grounded for weeks in Washington as the Biden team grappled with the Taliban deal they inherited, has now been empowered to push even harder to find a way out of this war. His arrival in Kabul last week sparked a new buzz among President Ghani's allies and enemies. A revised seven-page \"discussion draft of a peace agreement\" - also obtained by the BBC - sets out a roadmap towards \"a transitional Peace Government of Afghanistan\".\nThe new plan is full of detail but fraught with risk. It's already meeting resistance: from both the Afghan government and the Taliban; and from Afghans who worry that a peace cobbled together too quickly will only make this war even worse. \nThe Trump administration made withdrawing troops from Afghanistan a priority.\nThe deal signed in February 2020 said that the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled, and proceeding with national peace talks.\nAlthough the Taliban, a hard-line Islamist movement, stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government.\nAs a condition of starting negotiations with the Afghan government, the Taliban also demanded that thousands of their men be released in a prisoner swap. \nDirect talks then began Doha in September 2020, but a breakthrough has still not been reached."

By naming him as they did, the couple chose not to use a title for their first born. \nWhen the name was announced, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the decision was a strong indication the couple did not want to bring him up as a formal royal.\nBorn: 2021\nThe Duchess of Sussex gave birth to her second child in Santa Barbara, California. on 4 June 2021. Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor - to be known as Lili - is named after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen and is her 11th great-grandchild.\nShe was given the middle name Diana in honour of Prince Harry's mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old.\nBorn: 1960\nPrince Andrew, ninth in line to the throne, was the third child of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. \nHe was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986.

Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York. She has no official surname, but uses the name York. \nShe married property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020.

      "text": "The Pope Francis visited parts of northern Iraq once held by Islamic State (IS) militants on the third day of his historic trip to the country.\nChristians were among those targeted by IS when they seized the region in 2014, carrying out human rights abuses.\nOn Sunday the Pope prayed among ruined churches in Mosul, the former IS stronghold, before meeting Christians. \nCelebrating Mass at a stadium in Irbil, the last big set piece of his visit, he said Iraq would remain in his heart.\nThousands of people attended the service despite Covid-19 concerns.\nIraq, which has seen more than 13,500 deaths with Covid-19 and more than 726,000 cases, has recorded a sharp rise in infections over the past month.\nThe 84-year-old leader of the Catholic Church and his entourage have all been vaccinated, but Iraq only received its first batch of doses last week.\nThe four-day trip, which began on Friday, was the pontiff's first international excursion since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago, and the first-ever papal visit to the country. He flew home on Monday morning.\nIn Mosul he visited Church Square to pray for the victims of the war with the Islamic State group, which left thousands of civilians dead.\nSurrounded by the tottering ruins of the square's four churches, he said the exodus of Christians from Iraq and the broader Middle East had done \"incalculable harm not just to the individuals and communities concerned but also to the society they leave behind\". \nReferring to the historic region of Mesopotamia, which covered much of modern Iraq including Mosul, Pope Francis said: \"How cruel it is that this country, the cradle of civilisation, should have been afflicted by so barbarous a blow, with ancient places of worship destroyed and many thousands of people - Muslims, Christians, Yazidis and others - forcibly displaced or killed.\n\"Today, however, we reaffirm our conviction that fraternity is more durable than fratricide, that hope is more powerful than hatred, that peace more powerful than war.\"\nIS desecrated Christian places of worship, beheading religious statues and planting booby-trap bombs. Tens of thousands of Christians fled IS control while those who remained faced having their property stolen and choosing between paying a tax, converting to Islam, leaving or facing death.\nA cross erected on Church Square in honour of the Pope's visit was crafted from wooden chairs rescued from churches across the region, Middle Eastern news outlet The National reports. \nIn the nearby town of Qaraqosh, the Pope met Christians in the ancient Church of the Immaculate Conception, which was once torched by IS and has now been restored.\n\"I can't describe my happiness, it's a historic event that won't be repeated,\" said Yosra Mubarak, 33, before the Pope's visit. She was three months pregnant when she left her home seven years ago with her husband and son, fleeing the violence.\n\"It was a very difficult journey, we fled with only the clothes we're wearing... There was nothing left [when we returned], but our only dream was to come back and here we are and the Pope is coming,\" she told Reuters news agency.\nThe Roman Catholic leader arrived by motorcade at the stadium in Irbil on Sunday afternoon, switching to a Popemobile to the delight of those waiting. \n\"In my time among you, I have heard voices of sorrow and loss, but also voices of hope and consolation,\" he told those attending.\nSince arriving in Baghdad on Friday, Pope Francis has called for an end to violence and extremism and said that Iraq's dwindling Christian community should have a more prominent role as citizens with full rights, freedoms and responsibilities.\nOn Saturday, in a highly symbolic meeting with the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in the holy city of Najaf, the Pope echoed this message, saying that Christians should be able to live in peace and security like all other Iraqis.\nAudiences with the reclusive 90-year-old spiritual leader of millions of Shia Muslims are rare, but he received the Pope for around 50 minutes, the pair talking without face masks.\nThe Pope then visited the site of the ancient city of Ur, believed to be the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, who is revered in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\nIraq has been wracked by religious and sectarian violence, both against minorities and between Shia and Sunni Muslims too. \nPeople in what is now Iraq embraced Christianity in the 1st Century AD, making Christians one of the country's oldest religious communities.\nAbout two-thirds of Iraqi Christians are Chaldean Catholics, whose Eastern-rite Church retains its own liturgy and traditions but recognises the authority of the pope in Rome.\nNumbers overall have plummeted over the last two decades from 1.4 million to about 250,000, less than 1% of the country's population.\nMost of those who remain live in the Nineveh Plain and Kurdistan Region in the north of the country.\nMany Christians have fled abroad to escape the violence that has plagued the country since the US-led invasion in 2003 that ousted Saddam Hussein.\nA US state department report on religious freedom in Iraq in 2019 found that Christians, as well as Sunni Muslims, complained of harassment at checkpoints by Shia security forces and some discrimination in education."

      "text": "A life-changing drug has been approved by the NHS to treat babies with a rare fatal genetic disorder.\nThe gene therapy Zolgensma offers hope to infants with a type of severe spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\nWith a list price of \u00a31.79m it could become the most expensive drug ever approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).\nNHS England says it has negotiated an undisclosed discount that is 'fair to taxpayers'. \nThe Scottish Medicines Consortium also announced later on Monday that it has approved the drug. \nAround 80 babies and young children with type 1 SMA could benefit from the treatment each year in England, say experts.\nThe condition causes muscle weakness and affects movement and breathing, meaning most babies who have it do not live past two years without intervention.\nWhen a lottery 'wins' sick babies life-saving drugs\nAlmost 1m Belgians pay for life-saving drug\nChildren with the condition often need breathing assistance or a feeding tube. \nThe one-off treatment has been described in the British Medical Journal as \"the most expensive drug course of treatment ever\" .\nIn draft guidance, Nice ruled that although the drug was hugely expensive, its use is justified by the exceptional impact it can have on young children.\nIt is hoped that if the drug is given to children in their first six months of life before they develop symptoms, it might come close to being a cure by halting disease progression. \nRajdeep Patgiri's daughter Tora had the treatment in the US when she was nearly 11 months old. \nRajdeep says it has made a big difference to her life and what she can now do: \"She has been able to sit independently...she can stand independently and walk with assistance. So a lot of progress. \n\"Before, at the time of diagnosis and before treatment, time felt like an enemy because every day you expect something to deteriorate. And now, time is a friend because every day she improves even by tiny bits so there is always something to look forward to.\"\nThe drug contains a replica of the missing gene SMN1. \nIn studies, it has helped babies to reach milestones such as breathe without a ventilator, sit up on their own and crawl and walk after a single infusion treatment.\nAt present only limited data about the impact of Zolgensma is available from clinical trials, so any decision to give it to older children aged between six and 12 months will have to be taken by a national team of clinicians.\nAnother drug called Spinraza, which is already available, can help slow the degeneration in some SMA patients, but it must be taken for life. \nMeindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at Nice, said: \"Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a very serious, debilitating and distressing condition that has very significant effects on every aspect of life of those with SMA, and their families and carers. \n\"As is the case with many new treatments for very rare diseases, limited evidence means there are uncertainties about the long-term benefits.\n\"But for some babies who are diagnosed before they have symptoms, it might come close to being a cure.\"\nNHS England Chief Executive Sir Simon Stevens said they had \"moved mountains\" to make the treatment available.

She has always denied the charges against her.  \nSpeaking after her ankle tag was removed on Sunday, Mr Ratcliffe said told the PA news agency it was \"a mixed day for us\" and \"Nazanin is genuinely happy\" to be free of her electronic bracelet. \n\"I'm a bit more guarded - it feels to me like they have made one blockage just as they have removed another, and we very clearly remain in the middle of this government game of chess,\" he said. \nHe told the BBC that his wife had gone to see her grandmother and was \"determined to enjoy the afternoon and not think about what it all means\". \n\"I don't think we expected something clean but how muddy this is I'm not quite sure yet,\" he said.\nEarlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Iran \"continues to put her and her family through a cruel and an intolerable ordeal\".\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, had been out of prison since last spring due to the coronavirus pandemic but had been confined to her parents' house. Her sentence was due to end on Sunday. \nShe was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her young British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\nThe dual national was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denies. \nShe has not yet had her British passport returned to her, according to Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency in London where her family live.\nMs Siddiq told the BBC: \"She does have to go back to court and we don't know what awaits her there.\n\"Nazanin is quite worried because there was talk of another case being put against her which may of course mean another sentence, and we don't know how long for.\"\nHowever Ms Siddiq said the removal of her ankle tag meant she could visit her elderly grandmother \"which is the thing she mentions every time I speak to her\". \n\"So on one hand they are celebrating that she has some elements of freedom in terms of not having the tracker anymore, but we just don't know what's going to happen in the court case,\" she added. \n\"I know her daughter has been counting down the days on her calendar at home for her mother to return.\"\nJeremy Hunt, who served as foreign secretary while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in jail, said Iran's actions were \"totally and utterly inhumane\". \n\"At the centre of this is an innocent woman, her husband and her daughter,\" he told the BBC, adding that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe should be allowed to return home to the UK. \nShadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there had been \"an increasing use of this totally unacceptable hostage diplomacy from Iran\", and that the government was right to condemn the use of individuals such as Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe \"as a bargaining chip in this wider political game\".\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrat's spokeswoman for foreign affairs, Layla Moran, has called for the UK to impose sanctions if she is sentenced for a second time. \n\"Strong words must be backed by the threat of real action if the Iranian authorities do not do the right thing,\" she said.\nAntonio Zappulla, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's employer at the time of her arrest, said he had spoken to her on Sunday and she was \"ecstatic\" to be able to have a coffee in a caf\u00e9. \n\"Nazanin should be allowed her permanent liberty and to walk away from this appalling affront to justice; instead, for all intents and purposes, she is still held hostage,\" he said. \nAnd Kate Allen, director at Amnesty International UK, said the news that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's ankle tag had been removed was \"bittersweet\" and \"yet another example of the calculated cruelty of the Iranian authorities\". \n\"Nazanin was convicted after a deeply unfair trial the first time around and this spurious new charge and possible trial is clearly designed to delay her release and exert yet more pressure on Nazanin and her family,\" she said. \n\"This won't be over until Nazanin has her passport and is on a flight heading home to the UK,\" she added, urging the government to take \"serious diplomatic action\". \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence has included eight months of solitary confinement, blindfolded interrogations and hunger strikes to press for medical treatment.\nPrior to her arrest, she lived in London with her husband and child.\nIn November, she was taken to court on fresh charges of spreading propaganda against the Iranian regime. \nHer family and the UK government have always maintained her innocence and she has been given diplomatic protection by the Foreign Office - meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran.\nMr Ratcliffe believes his wife and other dual nationals are being held hostage because Iran wants the UK to pay a decades-old debt over an arms deal that was never fulfilled."

      "text": "All parts of Wales have seen a rise in road traffic in recent weeks, compared with the first national lockdown.\nSome areas recorded almost double the amount of vehicles, Traffic Wales and Welsh Government figures reveal. \nThere has been a 62% rise in road use across Wales over the most recent six weeks compared with the first six full weeks of restrictions from March 2020.\nThis is despite almost identical restrictions, with people asked to avoid all non-essential travel. \nTraffic data is recorded by the Welsh Government at specific points on roads, including main routes like the M4 and A55.\nFigures for 2020 and up to 20 February 2021 have been obtained by BBC Wales and from them we can get an indication of the traffic picture throughout the country.\nNewport saw the lowest increase in traffic in Wales, with just over 420,000 (30%) more vehicles recorded.\nThis goes against the trend in the rest of south Wales, with every other site recording a increase higher than 70%.\nBeulah, near Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys saw an increase of 58% - the lowest figure outside the M4.\nThis recent increase follows an initial dip over the Christmas period, which saw the lowest traffic levels of 2020. \nThe traffic levels we are seeing now were not reached last year until the very end of June, 14 weeks after the first restrictions were put in place. \nDuring summer the amount of road traffic recovered to levels seen before any restrictions were in place. \nHowever each subsequent lockdown is seeming to have less of an effect on the numbers.\nProf Stuart Cole, emeritus professor of transport at the University of South Wales, said people were \"overcoming the scare that was put about\" during the first lockdown, but added that commuting was likely to fall because of homeworking.\n\"People just think 'well this is really efficient, I can talk to anybody just as efficiently'. So I think the new market's going to be leisure for the trains,\" he said.\nJohn Parkinson, head of psychology at Bangor University, said while he acknowledged the impact of \"lockdown fatigue,\" he thought people's intentions to follow the rules remained \"incredibly high.\"\n\"If you have an end-point it should help people, it helps planning, commitment, and it helps motivation.\nBut he said as vaccination rates rose, there could be a belief that \"it must be safe now\".\n\"So I imagine that could have a negative impact on compliance to rules.\"  \nConwy has seen one of the largest traffic increases in Wales, with just under the double the amount of traffic recorded. \nData released by Google allows us to calculate changes in travel behaviour of communities over time, compared to a baseline figure taken in January-February 2020.\nUsing this data for Conwy, we can see that the number of people visiting parks and outdoor recreation areas has often reached levels higher than even before the pandemic. \nThe amount of people visiting supermarkets has stayed at around the same level.\nHowever visits to retail and hospitality destinations in general have recently seen levels almost 80% lower than pre-lockdown numbers. \nOne striking decrease in behaviour, seen throughout Wales, is the decrease in people using public transport, with many regions showing more than a 60% reduction, potentially leading to inflated road traffic. \nProf Cole said he thought messaging about avoiding public transport would have a lasting impact on passenger numbers. \n\"You believe [the government] when they say the scientists have said to stay at home, you must not travel on public transport, public transport is dangerous. \n\"That will be in people's minds for quite some time,\" he said.\nHe said reassuring people public transport is safe would take a lot of time, with the most optimistic forecasts showing figures returning to 80% of the pre-pandemic level over the next three years, and only then with no restrictions in place."

      "text": "Education Minister Peter Weir is to bring forward a proposal to scrap the plan to pull P1-P3 children back out of classes on 22 March.\nNI's youngest pupils returned to school on Monday for the first time since before the Christmas break.\nChildren in primary one to primary three (aged four to seven) and those in nursery and pre-school went back to class.\nThe plan is that they will then return to remote learning on 22 March.\nHowever, Mr Weir said this does not make \"enormous sense\" and he will bring a specific proposal to the executive for those year groups to continue in the classroom.\n\"I think we need to see continuity of learning,\" he said.\nOn Monday a further two coronavirus-linked deaths and 144 new cases were reported by the Department of Health.\nIt brings the death toll recorded by the department to 2,077.\nThere are 220 inpatients being treated for coronavirus in Northern Ireland hospitals and 35 people in ICU, 25 of whom are ventilated. \nAs of Monday, 631,654 Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland, of which 588,803 were first doses and 42,851 were second doses.\nMeanwhile no further coronavirus-linked deaths have been recorded in the Republic of Ireland. \nAs of Monday, the country's death toll remains at 4,422. A further 437 new cases were reported. \nThere are 418 patients currently being treated for Covid-19 in the Republic, 103 of which are in ICU. \nOnly special schools in Northern Ireland have remained open to all pupils since the start of term in January.\nVulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have also been able to attend school and can keep doing so.\nThat has meant about 90% of Northern Ireland's 350,000 children have been learning remotely for more than two months.\nThe executive has decided that the youngest pupils should return to school first.\nIt is then planned that they will resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of post-primary pupils in years 12 to 14 until the start of the Easter holidays.\nHowever, that has been criticised by some primary school principals and the executive is expected to decide this week whether children in primaries one to three can remain in school until the Easter break.\n\"I'll be bringing proposals forward [to the executive] which will say actually particularly for P1 to P3, they should carry on throughout and I think we don't want to see any more disruption to our young people's education,\" said Mr Weir.\nHe said health officials would need to consider this proposal and his suggestion that other primary school year groups - P4-P7 - also return to classes this month.\nHe said there was \"no substitute for children being directly in school themselves on a face-to-face basis\".\nPupils in primaries four to seven and years eight to 11 in post-primaries do not yet know when they will return to school.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Weir said the return was a \"significant step\" and his main aim was for all pupils to be back in the classroom.\n\"A couple of weeks ago when we took the initial decisions it was probably quite a precautionary mood,\" Mr Weir said. \n\"I want to see that moving as quickly as can be safely accommodated. \n\"I want to see the P1 to P3s remaining in school throughout and I want to see an early return for the remainder of primary and also the remainder of secondary school pupils.\"\nThe minister said he could not guarantee that this would happen but he would be acting as a \"persuader\" with the executive.\nThe minister said he was also working alongside health experts to examine how Covid-19 testing might work in schools and he confirmed that face coverings would also be worn.\n\"It's not necessarily ideal but all these things are about a balance,\" Mr Weir said.\nSchools have also been told that breakfast clubs, education visits, inter-school sports and after-school activities should not take place until at least after Easter.\nThe Department of Education (DE) has previously advised teachers to avoid using terms like \"catch up\" when children return to school.\n\"The vision is for a balanced day where children are able to play, are ready to learn and feel able to re-connect,\" the DE guidance said.\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) has previously said that schools - including special schools - are not a major source of transmission of coronavirus.\nHowever, schools are expected to continue to keep pupils in class 'bubbles' to limit children from different classes mixing.\nSome pupils in Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have already gone back to the classroom as part of a phased return to school.\nSchools in England are reopening to all pupils on Monday.\nThat will be accompanied by mass rapid Covid testing in post-primary schools, although the tests for pupils are voluntary and need parents' permission.\nFrom Monday, there are also some slight changes to Northern Ireland's rules on click-and-collect for non-essential retail.\nClothing and footwear, baby equipment and electrical goods shops can all restart their contactless services, in line with public health advice.\nThe number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space has now also increased to 10 people from two households.\nThe executive will formally review the coronavirus restrictions again next week."

      "tags": "Companies,Steel industry,Greensill Capital",
      "text": "The principal financial backer of one of the UK's largest industrial groups has fallen into administration.\nSpecialist bank Greensill Capital was the main lender to businessman Sanjeev Gupta's sprawling empire, which includes Liberty Steel.\nThe appointment of administrators to Greensill puts 5,000 jobs at risk at Liberty Steel and other firms.\nIn a court filing, Greensill said Mr Gupta's operations were in \"financial difficulty\" and defaulting on debt.\nMr Gupta declined to comment on the claims, but his business GFG Alliance earlier said that it had adequate funding for its current needs. \nUnion officials are to hold crisis talks with the steel magnate on Tuesday. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK including in Rotherham, Motherwell, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool.\nThe Community union said: \"Sanjeev Gupta needs to tell us exactly what the administration means for Liberty's UK businesses and how he plans to protect jobs. The future of Liberty's strategic steel assets must be secured and we are ready to work with all stakeholders to find a solution.\" \nA spokesperson for Grant Thornton said its insolvency practitioners Chris Laverty, Trevor O'Sullivan and Will Stagg had been appointed as joint administrators of Greensill Capital and Greensill Capital Management Company.\n\"The joint administrators are in continued discussion with an interested party in relation to the purchase of certain Greensill Capital assets. As these discussions remain ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,\" the spokesperson added.\nMr Gupta, who has been called the \"saviour of steel\", has defied pessimists in the industry for years by buying up seemingly unloved industrial assets.\nThese included steel and aluminium plants that many thought could not be run profitably in the face of cut price competition from China. \nThe BBC understands that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng held an emergency meeting on Sunday with the chief executive of Liberty Steel UK, John Ferriman. \nThey discussed contingency plans in the event that Greensill went bust. \nIt is understood the options did not include nationalisation. Further meetings are expected later on Monday.\nMr Kwarteng also chaired a meeting of UK steel executives on Friday at which the future of Liberty, owned by Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, was brought up, \nHowever, it was not discussed in any detail with this wider group, which included union bosses. \nLiberty Steel is the UK's third-largest steelmaker, employing 3,000 people at 11 sites. Another 2,000 people in engineering businesses within the group are also involved.\nThat's a substantial chunk of the 32,000 people who work in the industry. \nEmployment and output have fallen significantly for the steel industry over the last four decades. In its heyday as the state-owned British Steel Corporation in the early 1970s, it had 10 times as many workers.\nThe whole UK steel industry has gone through a chequered period of ownership since it was privatised in the 1980s.\nHowever, the sector is still considered important by government ministers, regional politicians and business leaders.\nMany of Liberty Steel's assets were part of Tata Steel's UK business until they changed hands for \u00a3100m in 2017.\nWhen Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance snapped them up, he was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs. But his empire has often been criticised for its complicated structure and lack of transparent accounting.\nWith news of the financial problems facing Greensill Capital, one of Mr Gupta's key sources of finance, those criticisms are now coming home to roost.\nGreensill, run by former investment banker Lex Greensill, counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among its paid advisers. The BBC has approached Mr Cameron for comment.\nThe company specialises in short-term supply chain financing to provide capital for businesses around the world. However, it too has been accused of opaque accounting.\nGreensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business has prompted Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to \u00a310bn worth of funds held as security.\nTheir heavy exposure to each other has proved disastrous for both Greensill and Gupta. Mr Gupta's financing requirements constituted more than 50% of Greensill's lending volumes.\nWhile figures are not available for the proportion of his funding that Mr Gupta raised from Greensill, sources close to Greensill put his funding needs from the firm at $70m a day. \nA spokesman for Mr Gupta said Liberty's operations were \"running as normal\", had adequate funding for their current needs and that the refinancing plans were progressing. It added that a recent upturn in global steel prices was beneficial for the company's prospects. \nLiberty is a major supplier to the public, including hydro-power contracts in Scotland and steel contracts for the Ministry of Defence. The government said it was \"monitoring the situation closely\". \n\"This is a deeply concerning situation and a very worrying time for Liberty Steel workers,\" said Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers.\n\"It's vital that the government acts with the urgency required and doesn't wash their hands of the situation.\""

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors,Housing market,Mortgages",
      "text": "New guidance has been released aimed at reducing the number of wall safety surveys being requested by banks and building societies on blocks of flats. \nThousands of flat owners have been unable to sell or remortgage because they cannot get the checks done.\nThe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said it would help lenders save time when the inspections were not needed. \nMost lenders are likely to follow the advice but there is no guarantee.\nThe checks were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower.\nTo begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected.\nBut after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers.\nHundreds of thousands of leaseholders have since been asked for EWS1 external wall safety forms when they sell or remortgage.\nThis requires a specialist survey - but there haven't been enough qualified surveyors to do the checks, leaving thousands of owners \"in limbo\", according to the government. \nSome owners have also reported being asked for EWS1s when there appears to be little or no flammable materials attached to their building.\nRICS said its new guidance would clarify types of properties which will, and will not, require additional inspections to speed up mortgage approvals. \nIt said the guidance was the result of \"painstaking\" consultation with valuers, leaseholders, lenders' fire safety experts and government.\n\"This announcement is a crucial step in unlocking the market, by ensuring that only those buildings where there are risks of costly remediation as a result of safety concerns from cladding are subject to additional checks,\" said Dame Janet Paraskeva, chair of the RICS Standards & Regulation Board.\n\"The guidance is anticipated to result in a reduction in the number of EWS1 requests which will therefore allow more focus on the assessments of higher risk buildings, which should speed up the overall process whilst ensuring appropriate protection for lenders and purchasers.\"\nLast year the government tried to solve the backlog by saying that flats in buildings without cladding would no longer need EWS1 checks. \nBut mortgage lenders refused to recognise the directive. \nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said RICS' new guidance would mean \"nearly 500,000 leaseholders will no longer need an EWS1 form - helping homeowners to sell or re-mortgage more quickly and easily\".\nHe added that the government had paid for an additional 500 surveyors to be trained to carry out EWS1 checks when they are necessary.\n\"The government has also provided an unprecedented investment of \u00a35bn to protect leaseholders from the costs of cladding remediation,\" he said.\nIn a joint statement, UK Finance and the Building Societies Association, which represent lenders, said that they expected many lenders to follow the guidance \"which should see the number of EWS1 requests fall\". \nBut they added that it was still a decision \"for each lender to make based on their own risk appetite\".\nRICS said it would work with the government and other stakeholders to ensure the guidance is implemented by 5 April. \nIt will also publish advice for buyers and sellers about the risks associated with multi-story, multi occupancy buildings. \nNHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership.\nBut when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block.\nFollowing their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls.\nThe reason Holly was given by her lender was that a balcony on the building had a wooden floor.\nHowever, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria.\nThe lender refused a mortgage without it, as did the next bank she tried. The combination of this and her partner's cancer diagnosis took its toll.\n\"I properly broke down. If I knew how much stress this was going to cause, I would never have bought my flat,\" she told the BBC.\nShe remains unable to get a new mortgage but holds out hope. \n\"Naively or optimistically, I hope the guidance will provide clarity about whether I will be able to get a mortgage,\" Holly says."

The couple will also discuss their move to the US and their future plans.\nSeveral clips have already been released by CBS and have racked up millions of views.\nIn a clip shown on CBS's This Morning show earlier this week, Meghan was asked why she has decided to give an interview now.\nShe said it was the result of \"so many things\", including that \"we're on the other side of a lot of life experience that's happened and also that we have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to then\".\nIn two earlier clips released by CBS, Meghan said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silent if it was \"perpetuating falsehoods about us\", while Prince Harry drew parallels between the treatment of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Meghan.\nAfter these two clips were released, the Times published its report saying Meghan faced a complaint of bullying from her staff while she was a working royal at Kensington Palace.\nThe palace said it was \"concerned\" about the accusations and an HR team would look at the circumstances outlined in the article.\nOn the reported allegations of bullying, the duchess has said in a statement through her spokesman she was \"saddened\" by the \"attack on her character\".\nThe timing of the broadcast has come during a tumultuous period for the Royal Family.\nWhile the interview was recorded before the Duke of Edinburgh, Harry's grandfather and the Queen's husband, went into hospital, it will air as the prince continues his recovery in hospital following a procedure for a heart condition.\nIt also comes on the back of a more light-hearted interview Prince Harry gave to James Corden on The Late Late Show, which aired last week - again while Prince Philip was in hospital.\nIn her Commonwealth day address, the Queen spoke about staying in touch with family and friends during \"testing times\", and how there had been a \"deeper appreciation\" of the need to connect to others during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\"The testing times experienced by so many have led to a deeper appreciation of the mutual support and spiritual sustenance we enjoy by being connected to others,\" she said.\nAs footage was played of the Queen's numerous official video calls, the 94-year-old acknowledged, \"we have had to become more accustomed to connecting and communicating by our innovative technology\" to stay in touch with friends, family, colleagues, and others during the pandemic.\nShe added: \"Increasingly, we have found ourselves able to enjoy such communication, as it offers an immediacy that transcends boundaries or division, helping any sense of distance to disappear.\"\n\"We have all continued to appreciate the support, breadth of experiences and knowledge that working together brings.\n\"And I hope we shall maintain this renewed sense of closeness and community.\"\nAnd she praised the \"selfless dedication to duty\" of medical staff and other key workers."

      "text": "Stay at home rules banning all but essential travel could be eased when Wales' Covid regulations are reviewed.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said guidance could be changed to \"stay local\" as part of moves to \"restore more freedoms\".\n\"I think there is a case for an intermediate step between stay at home and being able to travel anywhere across Wales,\" he said.\nA review of lockdown measures is due to be announced on Friday.\nWales went into lockdown on 20 December following a spike cases.\nSince then the case rate, which measures the number of Covid infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, has fallen to an all-Wales average of 46, down from 437 in the run up to Christmas. \nAnd almost one million people have received their first dose of the Covid vaccine in Wales.\n\"I said two weeks ago at the last review that I hoped that this will be the last three weeks of the stay at home regulation,\" Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement.\n\"So, that is what we will be trying to make happen on Friday of this week.\n\"We will be looking carefully this week at whether an intermediate period of stay local - people are used to that, we had a period of that last year in Wales - whether that would be a first step on a journey. \n\"Remembering that in Wales that is how we are trying to approach the whole business - carefully, cautiously, step by step, not doing too many things at once - so that we can monitor the impact of changes, and then restore more freedoms to people and to the economy once we are confident that it's safe to do so.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price has previously said there should be a \"careful\" approach to easing restrictions due to new Covid variants.\nThe Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies has called for a \"clear roadmap out of lockdown\"."

      "tags": "NI Health,Nursing,Royal College of Nursing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A 1% pay offer for nurses in Northern Ireland would be a \"massive slap in the face\", according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in NI.\nThe union has set up a \u00a335m fund for possible strike action after the proposal was made for nursing staff in England.\nIt has called for a 12.5% pay rise.\nThe RCN's NI director, Pat Cullen, said the union would await the outcome of a pay review before considering its next steps in NI.\nThe government has said the 1% offer represents what is \"affordable\" at a difficult time for public finances because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nMs Cullen, referring to the clap for carers initiative, said \"it didn't take very long for government to move the claps to slaps\".\nShe said that members, who \"have carried us right through Covid... working 15-hour days on most days\", were now feeling angry and let down.\n\"Did we anticipate this happening as quickly and to be let down as quickly? Probably not, but the government just seems to have a very short-term memory on this occasion,\" she added.\nMs Cullen said the RCN had \"put substantial evidence to the pay review body\", which is assessing the policy in Northern Ireland.\nShe said she anticipated the results of this to be known by May or June.\n\"Let's see what will happen then\", she said, referring to the potential for members to be balloted for industrial action.\nThe prospect of a strike comes just more than a year since NI's largest health unions agreed to end months of industrial action over a pay and staffing levels dispute. \nIt is almost inconceivable that health workers find themselves in a position where they are talking about strike action again.  \nIn fact, if these threats come to fruition, an already astonishing year will be bookended by walkouts and industrial action.\nIn the 14 months since, health and social care workers have gone from the picket line to the front line, as they joined the fight against Covid-19. \nAfter the most difficult of years, it does feel scarcely credible that there's friction once again over a pay rise. \nThe government argues that 1% is all they can offer when there is a public sector pay freeze. But this offer has triggered \"dismay and anger\" among health unions. \nOne could argue health workers have the better hand. The support of the public will have been strengthened immensely over the last 14 months and that's something governments across the UK will have to filter into their negotiations. \nThe pay proposal in England covers most hospital staff, but does not cover GPs or dentists.\nA government spokesperson said the plan was a \"real-terms increase\" as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%.\nRCN general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair said 1% would represent about \u00a33.50 more per week in take-home pay for an experienced nurse.\nStormont's Department of Health said \"any decision on a pay award for NI health workers will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations\".\n\"We do not intend to pre-empt those recommendations.\n\"Our pay award decisions can also only be taken in the context of a wider public sector pay policy set by the Department of Finance.\"\nOn Saturday, a joint statement issued by the RCN, Unison, Nipsa and Unite unions said members in NI had responded to the government proposal with \"dismay and anger\".\n\"They know their worth and value, as does the public and all those who have been cared for by them over the last year,\" it said."

      "title": "Covid-19: School rapid test cannot be overruled, says minister",
      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is sticking to the rule that a positive rapid Covid test done in secondary schools in England cannot be overruled by the gold-standard tests processed by labs.\nConcerns have been raised by testing experts that significant numbers could be incorrectly told they are infected.\nThey have called for all positives from the rapid testing done in schools to be confirmed by the standard PCR test.\nThis is what will happen when testing is done at home after next week.\nIt will mean a pupil who tests positive at home with a rapid on-the-spot test - known as a lateral flow test - will have to isolate on the basis of that test, but will be told to get a PCR test which is processed in a lab. \nIf that PCR test is negative they will be released from isolation.\nBut for those done in schools - pupils are being offered three tests in the next two weeks - it will be assumed the lateral flow test is right. A PCR test cannot overrule the lateral flow test. \nOne of those who has been affected already is the family of Richard Patton, from Derbyshire.\nHis son tested positive after his school started rapid testing last week, so Mr Patton arranged for the 17-year-old to get a PCR test, which came back negative.\nBut the whole family, including his 15-year-old daughter, is still having to isolate at home.\n\"It makes no sense. They were looking forward to going back to school and are now stuck at home.\"\nThe Royal Statistical Society is one of the bodies which wants to see all positive tests in schools confirmed with a PCR test to avoid such cases.\nProf Sheila Bird, a member of the society's Covid-19 Task Force, has said false positives were \"very likely in the present circumstances\" because the large-scale testing, coupled with the low infection rates, meant the number of false positives could outnumber the true positives. \nHowever, Schools Minister Vicky Ford insisted the approach was right.\nShe told BBC Radio Four's Today Programme that the chances of a false positive - where a pupil is incorrectly diagnosed as having the virus - was \"very low\".\nShe said pupils who test positive via the lateral flow tests done in schools will need to isolate, along with their families and close contacts and \"should not take a PCR\".\n\"The really important thing is to make sure we can keep schools open and minimise the risk of Covid in classrooms,\" she said.\nThe chance of false positives may be very low as ministers suggest. But given that millions of schoolchildren are being offered a test, it could still lead to thousands of people having to self-isolate for no reason.\nIf just half of pupils take up the offer of three tests in school, and the false positive rate is 0.1%, that would lead to around 6,000 pupils being asked to isolate at home over the next week or so when they are not infected. \nThe rest of their family will also have to isolate, which means if they have siblings, they too will miss school. What is more, if the positive comes from the second or third test then the individual's close contacts in school will also be affected.\nIt means many thousands of children could be wrongly denied the chance of being in school after already spending the past two months at home.\nBut what is particularly baffling experts is that it is so unnecessary. Getting the test confirmed by a PCR test processed by a lab would solve the problem. By sticking to their guns, ministers could end up undermining the whole initiative.\nIt is unclear what the true false positive rate will be in school settings. Research by Public Health England has suggested it could be as high as three for every 1,000 tests done, but other studies have suggested it is nearer one.\nThe testing done in schools in recent weeks for the children of key workers and teachers show the number of tests returning positive results is in line with the lower estimate, suggesting a significant number of tests could be false positives.\nUniversity of Bath mathematical biologist Dr Kit Yates warned that the government's stance could undermine confidence in the testing policy.\n\"Not confirming less accurate lateral flow positives with more accurate PCR tests will put people off testing their kids. It's as simple as that.\"\nPrimary school children are not being asked to take rapid tests, but families can request tests for use at home."

      "text": "A review into the death of a woman who was killed by her husband has been ordered by the home secretary.\nAnthony Williams, 70, was jailed for five years after admitting to the manslaughter of his wife Ruth, 67, in south Wales.\nIt led to calls from MPs to review the sentence, claiming it was too lenient.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said she was \"not satisfied\" with Torfaen council's decision not to carry out a domestic homicide review (DHR). \nAfter writing to the council, Ms Patel said: \"This was an appalling case and my thoughts are with the family and friends of Ruth Williams.\"\nThe local authority's public service board said it will now carry out the inquiry. \nA trial cleared Williams of murdering his wife in their Cwmbran home during the first Covid pandemic lockdown in March last year.\nHowever, he admitted a charge of manslaughter by diminished responsibility, after strangling her to death.\nA group of MPs, including former justice minister Harriet Harman, argued Williams's sentencing was \"unduly lenient\" and called for a review by the attorney general. \nIn a letter seen by BBC Wales, Ms Patel said she had \"personally reviewed\" the case and the decision to not conduct a DHR. \nShe said: \"I am not satisfied with the conclusions reached by the Torfaen County Borough Council Public Service Board that there are no lessons to be learned from this tragic death.\"\nShe added in the letter: \"You have focused your decision not to conduct a review on the fact that the victim and perpetrator did not have any meaningful contact with local agencies or services and consequently determined that there were no lessons to be learned.\"\nBut Ms Patel said a DHR should look into why there was no contact and if there were \"circumstances which prevented the victim from gaining access to services\". \nShe said: \"DHRs offer a rare opportunity to understand the victim's life, learn practical lessons and provide the victim's family with closure - even if the outcome is neutral.\n\"You believe Ruth Williams' death to have been a spontaneous event, but I do not accept that there are no lessons to be learned here. \n\"A DHR would help to uncover whether there were missed opportunities and support your understanding about how to prevent further tragedies in cases where there do not appear to be any abuse.\"\nIn response, the Torfaen public service board said: \"The home secretary has directed that a domestic homicide review be undertaken and we will now progress this. \n\"This is a very sad and tragic loss of life and on behalf of the Torfaen public service board we once again pass our sincere thoughts and condolences to the family of Ruth Williams. \n\"The family are central to all domestic homicide reviews and one of our first priorities will be to contact the family and ensure appropriate support is provided throughout the review.''"
