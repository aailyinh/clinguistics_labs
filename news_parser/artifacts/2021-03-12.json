      "text": "Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has talked to head teachers about how he has coped with the personal pressure over his often-criticised handling of schools in the pandemic.\n\"Not every day has been brilliant,\" he told a head teachers' online conference.\nHe said that his \"supportive family\" and getting a puppy had helped him.\n\"A combination of a family and dogs are probably the things that keep you sane,\" said Mr Williamson.\n\"One thing about pets is that they're always going to be pleased to see you,\" he told the annual conference of the ASCL head teachers' union.\n\"I think leadership, as for so many head teachers, has sometimes been quite an incredibly challenging experience and often a very lonely experience,\" said Mr Williamson.\nThe education secretary has faced tough criticism over problems such as last year's exams, prompting calls for his resignation and speculation about being reshuffled out of his post.\nASCL's president Richard Sheriff said mental health had become a bigger concern. \nHe asked the education secretary: \"How have you managed your own wellbeing over the past year, because you must have had some pretty tough days in the office to try and recover from?\"\nMr Williamson said the \"thing that's made the biggest difference\" had been his family - \"having them around, having them to talk to\".\n\"And probably like a lot of families, we seemed to have made an investment in a puppy,\" he told head teachers.\nMr Sheriff, a head teacher in North Yorkshire, said school leaders recognised the intense pressures of decision making during the pandemic, including for politicians.\n\"There are leaders who have led before Covid - and then there are leaders who have led through Covid, who have had an experience that no one else could understand,\" said the ASCL president.\nBut Mr Williamson said he also faced questions about the education department at home from his wife, who is a teaching assistant.\n\"I obviously get quite a bit of lobbying,\" he said. \"You know our pillow talk is maybe a little bit different.\n\"She's always highlighting various issues where maybe the Department for Education hasn't always got it perfect all the time.\"\nThe education secretary paid tribute to how schools and teachers had responded to the \"unprecedented demands\" created by the pandemic.\n\"Everyone in this country has a far greater and deeper appreciation of the teaching profession,\" he told the conference.\nThe pandemic has led to the cancellation of written exams this year, for the second year in a row, and Mr Williamson was asked whether there would be changes to the exam system in the future, such as scrapping GCSEs.\nMr Williamson ruled out any removal of the exams, saying: \"We're absolutely going to be keeping GCSEs.\"\nHe said many students changed school or college at the age of 16 and it was \"really important that we have something that captures their attainment and their progress so far\".\n\"We're certainly not looking at getting rid of age 16 assessment, so I think GCSE is going to be there for an awful lot longer.\""

      "title": "UK exports to European Union drop 40% in January",
      "tags": "GDP,UK economy,Brexit,Office for National Statistics,Trade",
      "text": "UK goods exports to the European Union fell 40.7% in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while imports tumbled 28.8%.\nThe figures show the biggest drop since records began in 1997, and are the first since new trading rules between the UK and the EU came into force.  \nThe ONS said temporary factors were likely to be behind much of the falls.\nMeanwhile, new data showed the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown.\nThe economy is 9% smaller than it was before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBoth imports from and exports to the EU fell \"markedly\" in January, the ONS said. The value of goods exported from the UK to the EU fell by \u00a35.6bn in January 2021, while imports from the EU dropped by \u00a36.6bn. \nThe ONS said the fall in goods coming into the country were largely seen in machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals from the EU. \nCar imports, as well as medicinal and pharmaceutical products, were particularly affected.\nAccountancy firm KPMG pointed to Brexit as the likely culprit for the plunge in trade between the UK and the EU. In contrast, the UK's trade with non-EU countries grew by 1.7% in January. \nKPMG said intense stockpiling in December 2020 had brought some trade flows ahead of the Brexit deadline.  \nThe ONS said companies may have been using up that stock instead of buying new goods in January.\nIn addition, the end of the temporary trading arrangement between the UK and the EU coincided with the discovery of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK, which caused further complications and delays, after lorry drivers were required to take tests before crossing the border at the English Channel. \nThe figures are the first since the Brexit transition period ended and show the steepest falls since comparable records began.\nHowever, the ONS said data showed that things had begun to pick up. Firms were reporting that trade was getting easier and trade levels started to recover towards the end of the month. \nThe number of businesses saying they were unable to export between the middle and the final week of January had fallen by 5.4%, it said, and those saying they could not import had dropped by 3%.\nThe ONS said the data for the period was \"erratic\", while Goldman Sachs called it \"noisy\", meaning there was a lot going on and it was too early to tell how much of the fall was a temporary blip.\nHowever, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Suren Thiru, said: \"The significant slump in UK exports of goods to the EU, particularly compared to non-EU trade, provides an ominous indication of the damage being done to post-Brexit trade with the EU by the current border disruption.\n\"The practical difficulties faced by businesses on the ground go well beyond just teething problems and with disruption to UK-EU trade flows persisting, trade is likely to be a drag on UK economic growth in the first quarter of 2021.\"\nA government spokesperson said:  \"A unique combination of factors, including stockpiling last year, Covid lockdowns across Europe, and businesses adjusting to our new trading relationship, made it inevitable that exports to the EU would be lower this January than last.\n\"This data does not reflect the overall EU-UK trading relationship post Brexit and, thanks to the hard work of hauliers and traders, overall freight volumes between the UK and the EU have been back to their normal levels since the start of February.\"\nThe Office of National Statistics was keen to add the relevant health warnings alongside the Brexit trade figures this morning. \nSome of the drop in both imports and exports may be attributable to firms on both sides of the channel stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period - so they didn't need to move as many goods in January. Some will also be down to the pandemic and in some industries that's difficult to disentangle from any Brexit effect.\nNevertheless, as economists have noted this morning, there's no sugar-coating a fall of 40.7% in exports of goods to the European Union in January, our first month under the new trade agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson and signed on Christmas Eve.\nFrom the time of the referendum, the BBC has been highlighting the danger that it's not just tariffs that could jeopardise exports. The additional risk, well-known and well-discussed in Parliament, has always been that non-tariff barriers - such as vet checks on meat and poultry to the European Union - will boost exporters' costs sharply.\nThese costs will have to be passed on in higher prices, sharply reducing exporters' competitiveness. And that's if they can pull off the no-mean-feat of getting their goods across the Channel at all. The deal simply didn't get rid of non-tariff barriers to trade. Food exporters especially are now feeling the impact. \nThe ONS said January's contraction in the economy, down 2.9%, was a \"notable hit\".\nRetailers, restaurants and hairdressers were all affected by the latest Covid-19 lockdown.\nJonathan Athow from the ONS, said. \"Manufacturing also saw its first decline since April with car manufacturing falling significantly.\"However, increases in health services from both vaccine rollout and increased testing partially offset the declines in other industries.\"\nEconomic activity in health stood out, increasing by 8.7%, mainly through Covid testing and vaccine schemes.\nPantheon Economics noted a 28.1% drop in output from the food services and accommodation sectors between December and January which \"reflected many cafes and restaurants giving up on offering takeaway and delivery services, while the pandemic was raging\".\nIt also said households \"slammed the brakes on discretionary expenditure\", sending retail and wholesale output down 9%. \nThe contraction during January reflects a difficult period for the economy as the third lockdown kicked in.\nBut it was much smaller than expected and commentators in the main struck a positive note. \nPantheon Economics said the GDP figures were \"less dreadful than expected\".\nCapital Economics said the drop was smaller than during last April's lockdown, which fell 18.3% on the month.\nIts UK economist, Paul Dale, said: \"Overall, January's lockdown left the economy in a fairly big hole. But the government's easing roadmap has provided the ladder and the vaccinations are providing the willingness to climb out of it. \n\"By early next year, we think the economy will be peaking (sic) its head out of the top as GDP returns to the pre-pandemic level.\"\nKPMG said: \"Once restrictions are eased the economy is expected to pick up quickly, aided by the significant support the government has put in place. We expect growth of 4.6% this year.\"\u202f "

      "title": "MSPs approve Scotland's controversial hate crime law",
      "tags": "Scottish government,Hate crime,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "MSPs have passed Scotland's controversial new hate crime law.\nThe legislation consolidates existing law and extends protection for vulnerable groups with a new offence of \"stirring up hatred\".\nIt was passed by 82 votes to 32 a day later than expected, after MSPs ran out of time on Wednesday while debating a raft of amendments.\nOpponents of the bill said they still have concerns about a possible chilling of free speech.\nThere were four abstentions.\nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: \"I am delighted Holyrood has backed this powerful legislation that is fitting for the Scotland we live in.\n \"Parliament has sent a strong and clear message to victims, perpetrators, communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated seriously and will not be tolerated.\"\nThe Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Bill was first introduced last April in response to an independent review of Scotland's hate crime laws by Lord Bracadale, but has sparked fierce debate.\nUnder the bill, offences are considered \"aggravated\" - which could influence sentencing - if they involve prejudice on the basis of age, disability, race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or variations in sex characteristics (sometimes described as \"intersex\" physical or biological characteristics).\nIt also creates new offences of \"stirring up hatred\" - which previously applied only to race - and abolishes the offence of blasphemy which has not been prosecuted in Scotland for more than 175 years.\nAn earlier draft of the bill was criticised by the Law Society of Scotland for having a perceived low threshold for prosecution.\nA number of groups including religious and cultural groups, writers, journalists, campaigners and police raised concerns about its impact on free expression.\nThe Scottish government responded by modifying the wording and strengthening freedom of expression provisions.\nThe changes meant \"stirring up hatred\" would only be considered an offence if it was intentional.\nOn Wednesday, two amendments designed to further strengthen the protection of free speech were passed unanimously by MSPs.\nDuring the final debate on Thursday, Humza Yousaf argued that those provisions were strong enough to prevent criminalisation.\nHe said: \"To those who think they may accidentally somehow fall foul of the law... because they believe sex is immutable, or they believe an adult man cannot become a female or they campaign for the rights of Palestinians... or those that proselytise that same-sex relationships are sinful, none of these people would fall foul of the stirring up of hatred offence for solely stating their belief - even if they did so in a robust manner.\n\"Why? Because solely stating any belief, which I accept may be offensive to some, is not breaching the criminal threshold.\n\"This bill makes clear that we are listening to the victims of hate crime.\"\nIt was described in a heated five-hour debate as \"the most controversial\" piece of legislation ever considered by the Scottish Parliament.\nFrom its troubled beginnings, the Hate Crime Bill has been altered significantly. Changes were made during cross-party efforts in what some MSPs described as \"Holyrood at its best\".\nYet even with that scrutiny, concerns remain. Offences can now be committed even in private, an abandonment of an earlier \"dwelling defence\" in race hate law. \nEven with the Scottish government's insistence that the bar for prosecution is high, there are those who still believe this is an example of interference in private and family life. Why should any government, they ask, decide what can and can't be said in the privacy of one's home?\nWhat is the difference, though, if one intends to encourage others into action against a vulnerable section of the community, whether that encouragement is in public or in private? That's the position of the Scottish government.\nAnd then there is the issue of sex. Some - including Labour's Johann Lamont - say the bill should have done more to protect women. She referred to the violence and abuse women suffer at the hands of men.\nThis debate goes to the heart of how individuals identify themselves and asks how the authorities might permit them to discuss their place in society. MSPs have found themselves trying to strike a delicate balance between freedom of expression and freedom from persecution. Have they succeeded? Opinions vary.\nSo, having said all that, what does all this actually mean for you? Well, it depends on who YOU are and - crucially - how you're defined by this new law.\nHowever, Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said there was \"inherent ambiguity\" in the language of the legislation.\nHe claimed it did not strike the right \"balance\" between free expression and protection from hate.\nAnother amendment from MSP Johann Lamont that would have included women as a protected group under the legislation was defeated.\nThe government has instead set a working group to look at whether misogynistic abuse should be a separate crime.\nThis group, led by QC Baroness Helena Kennedy, is due to report within a year.\nScottish Labour's Neil Bibby agreed with Ms Lamont that the legislation was \"flawed\" because sex was not included as a protected characteristic.\nHowever he said we \"ultimately have to recognise this bill will give protection to minorities\".\nHe said: \"It makes sense that we should seek to consolidate, modernise and reform Scotland's hate crime laws. We need this bill because hate crime has become more widespread. Society has become more polarised and divided.\"\nLiberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur also said he thought it was \"anomalous\" to leave out sex as a protected characteristic.\nHe said his concerns had \"not wholly disappeared\" but he had been \"persuaded on balance\" to vote for the bill.\nMSP John Finnie from the Greens dismissed suggestions from opponents that family dinners could be \"ruined by a flurry of arrests\" if people made controversial comments.\nHe said: \"The bill, like others, is about balance, and I think the balance between the freedom of expression and the right to private life has been struck by this bill, and countless organisations agree.\""

      "text": "The creator of the web says coronavirus has highlighted the importance of internet connectivity as a basic right. \nSir Tim Berners-Lee says too many young people do not have internet access and the digital divide has widened during the pandemic. \nHe called on governments to invest to provide universal broadband by 2030. \n\"We can't afford not to do it,\" he wrote in his annual letter to mark the anniversary of the world wide web.\nSir Tim first conceived of the web while working at the Cern particle research lab in 1989. \nHe says over the last 12 months, it \"has proven to be a lifeline that allows us to adapt and carry on\".\nBut, he says, one-third of young people do not have any internet access and many more lack the quality of connection needed to work or learn from home. \nIn an interview with the BBC, he said that as the web became more powerful, the digital divide between the haves and have-nots had grown wider. \n\"That's always been the case,\" he says.\n\"Now working from home, and learning at home, have made it much more clear.\"\nHe says this applies in the UK as well as in developing countries.\n\"The UK cannot be complacent,\" he says. \n\"A shocking number of kids in the UK don't have meaningful connectivity.\" \nThe computer scientist is calling for an acceleration of the push to bring fibre broadband and better mobile connections to rural areas.\n\"It should be a much higher priority of both businesses and government,\" he says of his home country.\nOn Tuesday, the Secretary of State for Digital, Oliver Dowden, said the government was working \"tirelessly\" with broadband companies to extend access to hyperfast broadband.\n\"Two years ago, we were about 7% [of premises with] gigabit-capable broadband. We're now up to about 30%, and I'm confident by the end of the year that we'll get to 50%.\n\"I will be prioritising the hardest-to-reach places, and we will be setting out a broadband action plan in about a month or so.\"\nSir Tim's letter, written with the co-founder of the Web Foundation Rosemary Leith, calls for a global push to connect young people. \nIt quotes a figure of $428bn (\u00a3306bn), which the Alliance for Affordable Internet initiative says would need to be invested by governments and the private sector to achieve this aim by 2030. \nBut, the letter says, this would deliver huge economic benefits for the developing world and concludes \"we cannot afford not to do it\".\nSir Tim also expresses concern about misinformation and abuse on the web, particularly that aimed at young women. \nBut he says the pandemic has offered the opportunity to think again about improving his creation for everyone.\n\"There's a very positive energy about people fixing things, and building a better world,\" he says."

It was comedy that only works if you agree with the sentiment being expressed, and even then isn't actually funny.\"\nTalkRADIO presenter Kevin O'Sullivan tweeted: \"Oh happy day! Maybe some comedy instead?\"\nThe BBC said in a statement: \"We are very proud of The Mash Report but, in order to make room for new comedy shows, we sometimes have to make difficult decisions and it won't be returning.\n\"We would like to thank all those involved in four brilliant series and hope to work with Nish Kumar, Rachel Parris and the team in the future.\"\nSome press reports linked the decision to BBC director general Tim Davie's promise to \"renew our commitment to impartiality\".\nWhen he took up the job last September, Mr Davie signalled the commitment would extend beyond news to comedy programmes, in an effort better represent all sides of the political divide.\nHe dismissed reports that he could axe comedy shows that were seen as too left-wing as \"ridiculous\", but said he did want \"to nurture brilliant writers from all kind of perspectives\".\nAfter the news emerged, host Kumar tweeted: \"A lot of people are asking me for a comment and here it is.\" He posted a grab of a 2019 episode in which he showed the words \"Boris Johnson is a liar and a racist\" on a screen.\nThe Mash Report began as a spin-off of The Daily Mash website, and its last series went out in April and May 2020.\nIt was also confirmed on Friday that quiz show Eggheads will be leaving the BBC and moving to Channel 5.\nIn a statement, host Jeremy Vine said: \"I can't wait to be reunited with the mighty Eggheads and see new teams try to take them on. I'm sure fans of Eggheads will share in my delight that it has found a new home on Channel 5.\"\nVine already presents a daily mid-morning news and debate programme for the network, after taking over the slot from The Wright Stuff in 2018.\nA BBC spokesman said: \"We sometimes have to make difficult decisions in order to grow new shows and we would like to thank the Eggheads and host Jeremy Vine for their time on the BBC and wish them well with their next chapter.\" \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

However, there was still a cut of 6% in total payouts made by insurers, to \u00a38.3bn.\nMotorists may have hoped to see these savings reflected in lower premiums. The cost of new comprehensive motor insurance did fall to a four-year low, but only dropped by 1%. \nThe ABI said this was the result of various factors, some - but not all - of which were the result of the impact of the pandemic.\nIt said that some insurers had been altering existing policyholders' deals owing to their lower mileage, which had included offering rebates.\nExtra services had also been included, without charge, such as automatic cover for those driving to and from work, or delivering medicines or groceries. Drivers who are financially stretched have also been given the option to pay premiums in instalments.\nThere is no guarantee that prices will get any cheaper in the future, despite new controls on whiplash claims.\n\"As we edge back to some form of normality, cost pressures remain, such as increasing vehicle repair costs, reflecting ever more complex vehicle technology,\" said Laura Hughes, the ABI's general insurance manager."

      "text": "Rules on meeting people outdoors in Scotland have been relaxed.\nUp to four adults from two different households are now able to meet in any outdoor space, including in private gardens - an increase from two adults from two households.\nRestrictions on young people have also been eased, with four people aged between 12 and 17 able to meet even if they are all from different households. \nOutdoor non-contact group sports for people aged over 12 can resume.\nIt has also been confirmed that children under the age of the 12 will now be able to start outdoor contact sports such as football and rugby.\nUnder-18s can also travel across local authority boundaries to attend a club.\nFriday marked the first anniversary of the first confirmed Covid death in Scotland. A UK-wide minute's silence will be held on 23 March, the anniversary of the first lockdown.\nProminent buildings and landmarks throughout the UK will be illuminated to mark the anniversary, with the Kelpies, Wallace Monument and Ness Bridge among those in Scotland.\nThe government's previous plan for easing lockdown said that allowing four people from two households to meet outdoors was unlikely to happen before 15 March.\nBut First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the \"modest\" easing that came into force on Friday was the result of the progress the country was making in suppressing the virus.\nPeople should only go into someone's else's home if it is essential to reach a back garden, or to use the toilet.\nAnd the overall requirement to stay at home remains in place, except for specific purposes.\nThe latest statistics showed that a further 682 people have tested positive for the virus, taking the total number of confirmed cases since the pandemic began to 208,429.\nThe deaths of a further 17 people who had previously tested positive for the virus have been recorded, bringing the total by that measure to 7,500.\nBut National Records of Scotland figures released earlier this week showed that the total number of deaths from confirmed or suspected cases of the virus is now well over 9,000.\nThere are 512 patients in hospital with a confirmed case of the virus, a decrease of 13 on the previous day, while the number of Covid patients in intensive care units has fallen by two to 38.\nThe number of people who have received their first vaccine dose has increased by 18,836 since Thursday, and now stands at 1,844,636 - with 149,409 having received their second dose.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' leader Douglas Ross said the new easing measures showed that \"the government got it wrong originally\" and that the \"overly-cautious approach\" was not matched by the data.\nMr Ross said all pupils should be returning full-time from Monday rather the current plan, which will see some secondary pupils have less than two hours a week in the classroom. \nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown had to be the last one. \nHe added: \"We have got to get the vaccination programme right and strengthen our testing and tracing systems.\n\"The virus is still not going away and we are only using around a third of our testing capacity every day.\"\nEarlier this week Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that new cases of the virus, the number of people being admitted to hospital and deaths were all \"still higher than we would want\".\nHowever, she said there was a clear \"positive trend\" in figures, alongside \"excellent progress with the vaccination programme\".\nAlthough the number of vaccines being administered each day has has fallen in recent weeks, the first minister said supplies would soon increase to \"allow for a very significant acceleration\" of the programme.\nThe Scottish government has been considering accelerating its exit plan out of lockdown, which currently says that the country will return to a levels system towards the end of April.\nIt emerged earlier this month that new rules are set to make it harder for areas to drop down to lower tiers of these restrictions.\nIt is also expected that non-essential retail, hospitality and services such as gyms and hairdressers will reopen as part of the levels system.\nBut business leaders have said a return to this framework would be \"devastating\" and have called for more clarity on how the system would work.\nHow will you be affected by the relaxation of restrictions in Scotland?

      "text": "Sinn F\u00e9in has refused to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson on his visit to Northern Ireland.\nThe party described his trip on Friday as a publicity stunt.\nMr Johnson said he was \"always happy to meet all sides\" but had been told Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn F\u00e9in was \"otherwise engaged\".\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster urged him ditch what she called the \"intolerable\" post-Brexit arrangements known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nIt came into effect in January as part of the Brexit deal and means Northern Ireland remains in the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK has left, so checks are required on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Mrs Foster said the protocol was unworkable, had the backing of no unionist parties and created societal division and economic harm rather than protecting the Belfast Agreement that effectively brought to an end Northern Ireland's Troubles.\n\"Whilst grace periods have been extended unilaterally, we need a permanent solution so business can plan and the integrity of the United Kingdom internal market can be restored,\" said Mrs Foster, speaking after meeting the prime minister at a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.\nMr Johnson said the government's action to postpone the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol was \"lawful and indeed right in view of the impact on the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and the need to have consent from both communities\".\n\"The most important thing about the protocol is that it should guarantee the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said.\n\"There's got to be an east-west consent... as well as a north-south consent so that's what we're doing.\"\nMs O'Neill, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, said she and her party's president Mary Lou McDonald had a \"long-standing request\" to meet Mr Johnson.\nThey wanted to discuss \"commitments which he and his government have reneged on\" as well as his \"reckless and partisan approach to the Irish protocol\", she said.\n\"He did not facilitate the meeting,\" added Ms O'Neill. \"I have no plans to meet with him today.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in MP John Finucane went further, describing the prime minister's visit as a \"very superficial PR exercise\".\nThis visit feels like the first step in the prime minister's own pathway to recovery as he seeks to repair badly damaged relations with unionists.\nIt was no surprise that pathway included an early trip to Fermanagh - the home of Arlene Foster.\nEven before he arrived, his advance party had set the stage releasing details of events to mark Northern Ireland's centenary.\nBut it will take more than a special postmark, a concert and a centenary rose to heal the unionist hurt.\nFar from being the union's chief cheerleader, Boris Johnson is regarded by many unionists as the prime minister who betrayed Northern Ireland by agreeing to the protocol which created the Irish Sea border.\nIt is going to be a tricky visit for the prime minister labelled a \"lousy unionist\" by an Orange Order leader.\nIt is no surprise that much of the visit's focus was on the battle against Covid-19 and the successful rollout of the UK's vaccine programme.\nBut until he comes up with a political vaccine to eradicate the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Boris Johnson pathway to unionist recovery will not be smooth.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the success of Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme \"shows the strength of the union\".\nBut the UUP MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) warned that the Northern Ireland Protocol had brought challenges, particularly in terms of medical supplies.\nEarlier on Friday, Mr Johnson commended the military and emergency response teams at Aldergrove in County Antrim for their work throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.\nArmy medics were deployed to hospitals in Northern Ireland to assist staff dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases over the winter.\nMr Johnson thanked them for their \"incredible\" work in Belfast's Nightingale Hospital, where some of them gave patient care.\nThe prime minister also met scientists involved in vaccine research at Queen's University Belfast.\nHis last engagement in Northern Ireland was at medical 3D printing company Axial 3D in Belfast on Friday evening.\nThe prime minister last visited Northern Ireland in August - his first trip since power sharing was restored in January 2020 after a three-year hiatus.\nOn that trip, he held talks with Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill at Hillsborough Castle and also addressed criticism of plans to celebrate Northern Ireland's centenary.\nBefore his visit on Friday, Mr Johnson announced official events to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland.\nHe said the events would reflect on what made Northern Ireland \"the great place it is today\"."

      "text": "Gardeners are being urged to be on alert for the stink bug insect and other pests set to arrive in the UK.\nThe brown marmorated stink bug has been spotted at three places in England so far, but experts are warning that it may become more widespread.\nThe Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said gardeners should be on their guard for the insect.\nIt could appear alongside more familiar animals such as slugs, snails and the box tree caterpillar.\nAndy Salisbury, principal entomologist at the RHS, said the pests and diseases that gardeners commonly face on their plots have fluctuated over the last 25 years.\n\"With gardens taking on a more important role in supporting wellbeing and the environment, it's important that research into management and mitigation of them continues and our rankings help inform this focus,\" he said. \n\"It's also imperative that we continue to anticipate future threats such as the disease Xylella, which is already present in Europe, and the marmorated stink bug, to protect our gardens for the future.\"\nThe brown stink bug is one of a number of Asian insect species that have recently established and become a pest in the US, others being the harlequin ladybird, the emerald ash borer and the Asian longhorn. \nOf these, only the harlequin ladybird is firmly established the UK, where it is now the most common ladybird species.\nInsect curator at London's Natural History Museum, Max Barclay, predicts that the brown stink bug could establish in parts of the South East of England and may spread further with climate change.\n\"The brown marmorated stink bug is very similar to many harmless native species, so we hope people won't go out and start squashing everything similar!\" he said.\n\"We are only trying to determine how widespread it is at this stage, and we are happy to identify specimens sent to the museum's Facebook group or via email. \"\nThe three sightings so far have been in Essex, Surrey, and in the Museum's Wildlife Garden. \nThe warning came as the RHS released its latest tally of pests plaguing gardens, with slugs and snails topping the list.\nThe box tree caterpillar slipped down the rankings as its march slows across England and Wales.\nHoney fungus topped the list of diseases, as it has for 25 years.\nWith more people spending time in their garden during lockdown, the RHS reported an 88% increase in pest and disease enquiries last year.\nThe RHS conducts research on a wide range of plant pests and disease. This work will move to new science laboratories at RHS Garden Wisley, which will be opened to the public in June."

She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour,\" they said.\n\"She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives.\"\nThe marketing executive's family also thanked friends and the public for supporting them.\n\"We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing,\" they added.\n\"We are now pleading for additional help from the public.\"\nThe case has prompted an outpouring of shock and anger as women across the country share their own experiences of feeling unsafe. \nEarlier, Labour MP Jess Phillips read out the names of almost 120 women killed in the UK where a man has been convicted or charged as the primary perpetrator.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"shocked and deeply saddened\", adding: \"We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime.\"\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."

      "tags": "Bradford,Brazil,South Gloucestershire Council,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Four further cases of the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil have been identified in England, bringing the total in the UK to 10.\nThree cases of the P.1 variant are in South Gloucestershire and are said to be close or household contacts of the two existing cases in the area.\nThe other new case was identified in Bradford.\nScientists previously said the variant appears more contagious and there were concerns over its response to vaccines.\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said last week it was hoped that vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\nThe new Bradford case tested positive for Covid-19 in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February. \nSubsequent genomic sequencing identified the case as the P.1 variant, Public Health England said in a statement. \nThousands of positive Covid cases, from all across the UK, are sent for this further sequencing every week as scientists aim to identify any variants of the virus. \nThe new South Gloucestershire cases were uncovered when people were offered testing in response to the initial cases found in the area last month - and those who tested positive had their results sent on for further analysis.\nSpecialist contact tracing teams are working to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified.\nContact-tracers have advised close contacts of the individual in Bradford to isolate and get a test.\nThere are now seven cases of the P.1 variant in England and three in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil.\nIt was always known more cases of the P.1 Brazil variant were coming.\nWhen it was confirmed 11 days ago the variant was here, it was known two household members of the original South Gloucestershire cases had tested positive for Covid.\nThe results of the genomic sequencing to check which variant they had was not yet complete, but the expectation was it would be P.1.\nWhere does this leave us? A quarter of all Covid cases are being checked for variants and all the indications are that they are not spreading.\nThe new P.1 cases brings the total to 10, while there have been just over 300 cases of the South African variant and another 113 cases where the UK virus has acquired the E484 mutation which allows it to escape some of the immune response.\nThere will be more variants out there that have not been detected, but given that overall week-on-week Covid infection levels are lower we can be confident the variant is not taking hold.\nMonitoring this though is crucial to help the UK decide if vaccines updates are needed ahead of next winter.\nSeparately, Public Health England said a new variant identified in the UK was designated a \"variant under investigation\" on 4 March. It is not known where this variant first emerged.*\nIt said the variant - known as VUI-202103/01 - contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with so-called \"variants of concern\". \nBut it added that \"it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a [variant of concern]\".\nNo additional cases have yet been found.\nIn other developments, rough sleepers and other homeless people in England will be prioritised to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nIt comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people who are homeless or sleeping rough were likely to have underlying health conditions and should be offered jabs alongside those in priority group six - people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.\nThey should also be offered the vaccine without the need for an NHS number or GP registration, the JCVI added.\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in the UK has risen compared with recent days, after a further 6,753 cases were reported, according to the latest data.\nAnother 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded.\nAs of 10 March, some 23,053,716 people had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 1,351,515 had received a second dose.\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released in February. Three cases were initially found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. \nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - prompted intensive tracing efforts in the region as the identity of the person was initially unknown as he or she failed to register their test properly. \nBut that person was found at the end of last week and it was confirmed that he or she had  \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission.\nUnder current Covid restrictions, holiday travel is not allowed in the UK or abroad. Anyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education or work, and journeys within England are only allowed for limited reasons.\nThere are also travel bans on 33 countries \"where the risk of a new variant is greatest\", including Brazil and other South American nations. \nHowever, the ban on travellers from South America came into effect on 15 February, after one case of the Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. The latest Bradford case is also a person known to have travelled from Brazil via Paris just before that change came in.\n*This story has now been updated to reflect new information on UK variants on the Public Health England website. PHE previously reported two cases of the VUI-202103/01 variant had been found in the south-east of England in individuals who had recently been in Antigua. PHE now says: \"Despite the travel history of these cases there is no scientific evidence to determine where this variant first emerged.\""

      "text": "The way in which police officers restrained a father-of-two contributed \"more than minimally\" to his death, an inquest jury found.\nLeon Briggs died in November 2013 after being detained at Luton police station under the Mental Health Act, having been held face-down in the street.\nHis primary cause of death was \"amphetamine intoxication with prone restraint and prolonged struggling\".\nA jury found a number of serious police and ambulance failures.\nIt recorded a conclusion that his death was \"contributed to by neglect\".\nMr Briggs's mother, Margaret Briggs, said the conclusion of neglect did not \"reflect the evidence\".\n\"I am disappointed that the jury did not return a verdict of unlawful killing,\" she said.\nBedfordshire Police said the jury had \"identified a number of significant failings by the police\" for which it was \"truly sorry\", adding the force had made \"extensive changes\" since.\nOfficers were called to Marsh Road in Luton on 4 November due to concerns about the 39-year-old's erratic behaviour.\nAfter being restrained face-down, handcuffed and placed in leg restraints, he was lifted into a police van \"like he was a bag of potatoes\", witness Wendy Hamilton said.\nAs Mr Briggs was carried into the police station, the lorry driver was shouting and screaming in distress.\nHe was detained in a cell at about 14:25 GMT. Mr Briggs became unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital at about 16:15.\nThe inquest, held in Milton Keynes, was told Acting Sgt Loren Short and PC Geoff Bennett restrained Mr Briggs.\nThe officers said they \"wanted to do the best (they) could\" while he was \"shouting, struggling, and kicking out\", but the lawyer for Mr Briggs's family accused them of \"telling a pack of lies\".\nWitnesses said they heard Mr Briggs call out \"please help me\" while he was restrained face-down in a \"dangerous position\" on the concrete for more than 13 minutes.\nThe jury found that \"inappropriate weight\" was used against him, though police officers did \"reasonably believe\" it was appropriate.\nA secondary cause of death was given as coronary heart disease.\nBefore the inquest, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) paramedics who attended the call had admitted a failure to check Mr Briggs's vital signs or take him to hospital in an ambulance for medical treatment.\nTwo paramedics who watched him being restrained \"did not even speak to Leon\" or \"offer medical advice to police\", Lewis Andrews, EEAST clinical general manager, told the inquest.\nJurors said Mr Briggs had been experiencing psychotic disorder, caused by high usage of amphetamines, resulting in erratic and irrational behaviour and his subsequent detention.\nOfficers failed to recognise he was in a state of medical emergency and did not monitor him in the police van and cell, which also contributed to his death, the jury said.\nThe jury heard officers were \"laughing\" as Mr Briggs was motionless and lying face down in the cell. Officers later called out his name and asked \"are you all right?\".\nIn a statement after the inquest, Mrs Briggs said: \"Why did the police choose to treat my son, who was mixed race, as if his life had no value? They took away his human rights.\n\"To this day, those police officers still have their jobs and livelihoods and no one has been punished for Leon's death. \n\"There has been no accountability or justice.\"\nMrs Briggs urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to \"reconsider bringing prosecutions\". \nIn 2018 the CPS said no officers would be charged over Mr Briggs's death.\nMrs Briggs said she had \"been truly shocked by the brutality of the treatment\" of her son and \"by how he suffered in his last hour of life\".\n\"He committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor - with force used against him - and he was shackled,\" she said.\nBedfordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said Mr Briggs's loved ones had \"to wait far too long to hear all the facts surrounding his death\". \nHe said Mr Briggs \"was suffering a drug-induced psychosis triggered by amphetamine levels described by one expert as being 'off the scale'\". \n\"Unbeknown to officers he also had a serious underlying heart condition,\" he said. \n\"There is no easy way of managing such a situation.\"\nPC Peter Baron, who assisted officers during the restraint, told the inquest the way Mr Briggs was moved from the ground to the police van went against the \"approved technique\".\nEmma Carter, secretary of Bedfordshire Police Federation, said she disagreed with the jury's conclusion that Mr Briggs was restrained in a dangerous way, and said officers \"did their very best\" to deal with \"a very tragic incident\".\nMs Carter added that \"six colleagues were suspended from duty for more than five years as part of this process\".\nAt the time misconduct proceedings were dropped against five officers in February 2020, more than \u00a31m of public money had been spent on their pay while they had been suspended.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow. \nCoronavirus infections may be levelling off in some parts of the UK, data shows. Figures for the week up to 6 March suggest new cases continue to fall in England and Wales, but not in Northern Ireland or Scotland. The UK's latest R number - between 0.6 and 0.8 - suggests the outbreak is shrinking. A further 6,609 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK on Friday, up from the 5,406 cases reported a week previously, following a large rise in the number of recorded tests carried out. Another 175 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported.\nCountries should not stop using the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over fears it causes blood clots, as there is no indication this is true, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway are among the countries to pause its use. But on Friday a WHO spokeswoman said there was no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\nGoing to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are set to become legal again in Wales. The government is relaxing lockdown restrictions, with the \"stay at home\" rule replaced by a \"stay local\" message. Up to four adults from two households can meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday, First Minister Mark Drakeford says.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says a \"modest\" easing of lockdown rules that came into force on Friday could happen earlier, as a result of the progress made in suppressing the virus. Up to four adults from two different households are now able to meet in any outdoor space. Restrictions on young people have also been eased. Previous plans said this would not happen before 15 March.\nMusicians have shared their personal stories of life in lockdown, after the pandemic left thousands of jobs at risk and hundreds of UK music venues under threat of closure - all told through pictures by Bolton-based photographer Marge Bradshaw.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can check how many cases there have been in your area.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus vaccines,Bulgaria,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Countries should not stop using AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine over fears it causes blood clots as there is no indication this is true, the World Health Organization says.\nBulgaria, Denmark and Norway are among the countries that have paused its use.\nBut on Friday a WHO spokeswoman said there was no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\nMargaret Harris said it was an \"excellent vaccine\" and should continue to be used.\nAround 5 million Europeans have already received the AstraZeneca jab.\nThere have been about 30 cases in Europe of \"thromboembolic events\" - or developing blood clots - after the vaccine was administered. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nThe WHO is investigating the reports, as it does any safety questions, Ms Harris said. \nBut no causal relationship had been established between the shot and the health problems reported, she said.\nOn Friday, AstraZeneca said the recorded number of blood clots in vaccinated people was \"significantly lower... than would be expected among the general population\".\n\"An analysis of our safety data of more than 10 million records has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis,\" a spokesperson said. \nBulgaria's decision to pause its rollout followed similar steps by Denmark, Iceland and Norway as well as Thailand. Italy and Austria have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure.\nThe European Medicines Agency, the EU's medicines regulator, said earlier there was no indication the jab was causing the blood clots.\nOther countries, including the UK, Germany, Australia and Mexico, have said they are continuing their rollout.\nWhile vast numbers of people are being vaccinated at pace around the world, some of them will still get sick with other things unrelated to the vaccine. \nThese pauses for the AstraZeneca vaccine are not because it is unsafe to give. It's to allow time for experts to explore why a small number of people who were recently give the shot also developed blood clots.\nWhen an illness occurs shortly after vaccination, it is right to question whether the shot might have contributed in any way. \nThere is no indication or evidence, however, that the vaccine was linked or responsible. \nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring. Europe's drug regulator has also backed the vaccine, saying its benefits are clear. Covid can be deadly and vaccination saves lives. \nGermany's Health Minister Jens Spahn said he disagreed with the countries suspending the vaccinations.\n\"From what we know so far, the benefit... is far greater than the risk,\" he said.\nThe temporary suspensions come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the doses.\nIn the latest upset, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz complained that the EU was not distributing coronavirus vaccines fairly among member states - according to population size, as agreed. \nHe said some countries were striking side deals with vaccine makers instead of leaving procurement to the European Commission. \nThe German health ministry acknowledged in January that Germany had signed a deal for 30 million doses with Pfizer BioNTech in September.\nAlso on Friday, the WHO approved Johnson & Johnson's single-shot vaccine. It followed EU approval which was given on Thursday, while regulators in the United States, Canada and South Africa have also backed the drug.\nAfter cases declined in recent months, several European countries are now seeing a resurgence of the virus. France, Italy, Poland and Turkey have seen the highest numbers in recent weeks.\nThe whole of Italy is braced to enter the country's strictest lockdown measures over the Easter weekend, 3 to 5 April.\nUnder rules set to be confirmed by the government, residents will only be allowed to leave home for work, health reasons, essential shopping or emergencies. All non-essential shops will be closed as will bars and restaurants. School lessons must be held online. \nThe total number of deaths in Italy rose to 100,000 on Monday - the highest toll in Europe after the UK. Officials say infection rates are rising as new variants of the virus take hold. "

      "text": "The Weeknd has said he will boycott future Grammy Awards after being snubbed in this year's nominations.\nThe Canadian pop star, whose single Blinding Lights was the biggest-seller in the world last year, was not shortlisted for a single award.\nHe later called the lack of recognition \"an attack\".\nIn a new statement ahead of Sunday's ceremony, the singer said: \"I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys.\"\nHe said he would remain absent from the event until the Recording Academy, which organises the awards, got rid of the \"secret committees\" that decide many of the nominations.\nThe Grammys voting procedures are notoriously opaque, with review committees having the final say in 72 of the 83 categories.\nThe anonymous panels, which can include musicians, record label staff and experts, review the initial choices of the Grammy voters and have the final say over who makes the shortlist.\nOrganisers say they are vital to ensuring the awards are balanced, but many artists are suspicious about a procedure that means votes can be overruled.\nEarlier this week, former One Direction star Zayn Malik criticised the \"lack of transparency of the nomination process\", saying the current system \"allows favouritism, racism, and networking politics to influence the voting\".\nThe Weeknd isn't the first artist to withdraw. Drake declined to submit his 2018 album More Life for Grammys consideration, while Frank Ocean chose not to participate in 2017.\n\"I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated,\" he said. \"I'd rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.\"\nResponding to The Weeknd's statement, the Recording Academy's acting chief executive Harvey Mason Jr said the organisation was \"constantly changing\".\nHe told the New York Times: \"We're all disappointed when anyone is upset. But I will say that we are constantly evolving. And this year, as in past years, we are going to take a hard look at how to improve our awards process, including the nomination review committees.\"\nThe 63rd Grammys will take place in Los Angeles this Sunday, with performances from Harry Styles, Dua Lipa, Taylor Swift, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.\nBeyonce leads the way with nine nominations, while Taylor Swift is favourite to pick up the coveted album of the year award, for her first lockdown record Folklore.\nIf she wins, Swift will become the first woman to scoop the best album prize three times.

      "title": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe needs mental health treatment, charity says",
      "text": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government.\nThe charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed. \nThe report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD. \nDespite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied. \nPrior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called for her permanent release so she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK. \nThe report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence. \nThe Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday. \nNeither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC.\nIn the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing. \nAccording to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to \"extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran\" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK. \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\nWhilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online.  \n\"The interrogations were traumatising,\" she is quoted as saying in the report. \"They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service.  \n\"They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job.\"\nShe says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day.\n\"The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,\" she says. \"There were times I could not breathe.\"\nShe was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time. \nMr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: \"This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away. \n\"She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people.\"\nThe two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals.  \nMr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's \"need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands\". \nHe adds: \"And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands.\"\nHer interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors.\n\"I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,\" she reported.\nShe told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter. \n\"It was unbearable,\" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. \"I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me.\"\nIn July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands. \nHer incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment.\nThe report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives. \n\"She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,\" the report says. \n\"She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband.\"\nDr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group.  \nShe described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a \"remarkably resilient woman\" who was \"trying to keep hope, trying to be strong\" during her evaluation. \nBut she said: \"Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty.\"\nShe may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats.\nConcern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report.\nThe doctors say it is \"possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury\" in her right hand.\nAnd even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery.  \nShe will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms.\n\"Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,\" it concludes. \"In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment.\"\nBut it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK.\n\"The threat of a second trial remains very real,\" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative.  \n\"This report is evidence of the severe suffering that Nazanin has experienced in Iran due to the mistreatment suffered and the cruelty of a legal process that has never followed the rule of law, making it impossible for Nazanin to know when she will be reunited with her family.\"\nHer treatment, Redress says, clearly amounts to torture.\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"Iran continues to put Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe through a cruel and intolerable ordeal. Nazanin must be allowed to return permanently to her family in the UK and we will continue to do all we can to achieve this.\""

      "tags": "Twins,Women,IVF",
      "text": "More twins are being born than ever before but the world may now have reached peak twin, researchers say.\nAbout 1.6 million twins are born each year worldwide, with one in every 42 children born a twin.\nDelayed childbearing and medical techniques such as IVF have seen the rate of twin births rise by a third since the 1980s.\nBut it could be all downhill from here as the focus shifts to one baby per pregnancy, which is less risky.\nAccording to a global overview in the journal Human Reproduction, the peak was reached because of large increases in twinning rates in all regions over 30 years - from a 32% rise in Asia to a 71% rise in North America.\nThe researchers collected information on twinning rates from 165 countries for 2010 to 2015, and compared them with rates for 1980 to 1985. \nThe number of twins born per thousand deliveries is now particularly high in Europe and North America - and worldwide it's gone from nine per 1,000 deliveries to 12.\nBut twin rates in Africa have always been high and haven't changed much over the past 30 years, which could be due to population growth.\nAfrica and Asia make up about 80% of all twin deliveries in the world at present.\nProf Christiaan Monden, the study's author from the University of Oxford, said there was a reason for that.\n\"The twinning rate in Africa is so high because of the high number of dizygotic twins - twins born from two separate eggs - born there,\" he said.\n\"This is most likely to be due to genetic differences between the African population and other populations.\"\nTwinning rates in Europe, North America and Oceanic countries have been catching up - and the increasing use of medically assisted reproduction since the 1970s - for example IVF, ICSI, artificial insemination and ovarian stimulation - have been the main reason.\nThese techniques all increase the likelihood of a multiple birth.\nWomen choosing to start families later in life, increased use of contraception and lower fertility overall also play a role, the review says.\nBut the emphasis is now on singleton pregnancies, which are safer, says Prof Monden.\n\"This is important as twin deliveries are associated with higher death rates among babies and children, and more complications for mothers and children during pregnancy, and during and after delivery,\" he says. \nTwins have more complications at birth, are more often born premature and have lower birth weights and higher still birth rates.\nThe review found that the fate of twins in low and middle-income countries was more of a concern.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, many twins will lose their co-twin in their first year of life - more than 200,000 each year.\n\"While twinning rates in many rich Western countries are now getting close to those in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a huge difference in the survival chances,\" said Prof Jeroen Smits, a study author.\nLooking ahead, the researchers say India and China will play a major role in future twinning rates.\nDeclining fertility, older mothers at birth and techniques like IVF will all have a bearing on the numbers of twins in years to come."

      "text": "A 2,000-year-old device often referred to as the world's oldest \"computer\" has been recreated by scientists trying to understand how it worked.\nThe Antikythera Mechanism has baffled experts since it was found on a Roman-era shipwreck in Greece in 1901.\nThe hand-powered Ancient Greek device is thought to have been used to predict eclipses and other astronomical events.\nBut only a third of the device survived, leaving researchers pondering how it worked and what it looked like.\nThe back of the mechanism was solved by earlier studies, but the nature of its complex gearing system at the front has remained a mystery.\nScientists from University College London (UCL) believe they have finally cracked the puzzle using 3D computer modelling. They have recreated the entire front panel, and now hope to build a full-scale replica of the Antikythera using modern materials.\nOn Friday, a paper published in Scientific Reports revealed a new display of the gearing system that showed its fine details and complex parts.\n\"The Sun, Moon and planets are displayed in an impressive tour de force of ancient Greek brilliance,\" the paper's lead author,  Professor Tony Freeth, said.\n\"Ours is the first model that conforms to all the physical evidence and matches the descriptions in the scientific inscriptions engraved on the mechanism itself,\" he added.\nThe mechanism has been described as an astronomical calculator as well as the world's first analogue computer. It is made of bronze and includes dozens of gears.\nThe back cover features a description of the cosmos display, which shows the motion of the five planets that were known at the time the device was built.\nBut only 82 fragments - amounting to around a third of the device - survived, This meant scientists have had to piece together the full picture using X-Ray data and an Ancient Greek mathematical method."

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Femicide,Women",
      "text": "A vigil is being held a week after the killing of teacher Sabina Nessa, in a park in south-east London.\nHow many women are the victims of violent crimes?\nIn the year to March 2020, 207 women were killed in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). This means about one in four killings were of women. \nThe number of female victims was lower than in the previous year, when 241 women were killed - the highest number in a decade. \nResearch from the Femicide Census - an organisation which collects information on men's violence against women - calculates that across the UK, 1,425 women were killed by men in the 10 years to 2018.\nThat is about one killing every three days. \nIn the past decade, there were 4,493 male victims of killings and 2,075 female victims (31%) in England and Wales.\nMore than nine out of 10 killers were men.\nAbout 57% of female victims were killed by someone they knew, most commonly a partner or ex-partner. This compares with 39% of men. \nThe other victims were either killed by strangers - 13% in the case of women and 30% among male victims - or no suspect has been identified.\nMore than 70% of women were killed in their own home - twice the figure for men.\nIn general, men are more likely to be victims of violence such as assault.\nIt is estimated that about 1.3% of women were victims of violent crime in the year ending March 2020, compared with 2% of men. \nMost violent attacks are by people the victim knows - 92% in the case of women and 79% among men.\nWe don't have statistics which show what proportion of women were attacked by men or other women, but most people found guilty of violent crimes are men. \nIn 2019, about 85% of people sentenced in court for violent crime were men.\nIn the year ending March 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that 4.9 million women had been victims of sexual assault in their lives. This included 1.4 million who had been raped, or had faced attempted rape.\nAbout 989,000 men had experienced sexual assault, including 87,000 victims of rape or assaulted rape.\nIn total, 98.5% of the rapists were identified as men.\nSexual assault was most common among younger women, with about one in 10 women aged 16 to 24 having been a victim in the past year. \nOne in 40 young women said they had been victims of rape in the past year.\nOne in five women has been the victim of stalking since the age of 16 - twice the number for men.\nThe estimates used the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which interviews thousands of people and is seen as the best way of measuring crimes including those not reported to the police. \nThe vast majority of sexual offences do not get solved. In fact, most sexual offences do not even get reported to the police. \nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales shows 151,000 people - including 144,000 women - were victims of rape or attempted rape in the last year for which these figures are available.\nBut just 59,000 rapes were actually reported to the police last year.\nIn the same year, just 1,439 people were actually convicted of rape. This was the lowest number since figures started being released in 2014-15. \nAlmost a third of women tell no-one if they are victims of rape, or attempted rape, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales.\nFewer than one in six report it to the police. This falls to one in 10 women under 25.\nThe most common reasons for not reporting it are embarrassment, thinking the police couldn't help, or thinking they wouldn't be believed. \nOfficial statistics don't provide estimates of how many women face sexual harassment. \nHowever, surveys suggest the problem is common. \nA recent YouGov poll for UN Women found that seven out of 10 women had experienced some form of sexual harassment in public.\nThis number was nearly nine out of 10 for younger women. \nThe survey found: \nAnother YouGov survey, in 2016, found that half of women had been victims of sexual harassment at work, most often through inappropriate comments or touching.  \nLast year, it was estimated that 1.6 million women in England and Wales were victims of domestic abuse. There were 757,000 male victims.\nThese figures include all forms of abuse, including physical, emotional and financial. \nThere was an increase in domestic abuse since lockdowns began in March of last year.\nThere were 444,000 domestic abuse-related crimes - against both men and women - in England and Wales between April and September.\nThis was almost one in five crimes recorded."

      "text": "Sharon Osbourne has issued an apology for comments she made about racism while defending Piers Morgan on her US chat show The Talk.\nThe star was one of the first people to voice support for Morgan after he left Good Morning Britain over his criticism of Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.\nOn Wednesday, she angrily challenged her Talk co-host Sheryl Underwood to identify when Morgan had been racist.\nBut she has now said she \"panicked, felt blindsided [and] got defensive\".\nOsbourne's statement followed criticism on social media that she had appeared to belittle a black woman's experiences of, and perspective on, racism.\nIn Friday's statement, she apologised to \"anyone of colour that I offended and/or to anyone that feels confused, or let down by what I said\". She explained that she had \"allowed my fear and horror of being accused of being racist take over\".\nMorgan himself was not impressed. \"Sharon's been shamed and bullied into apologising for defending me against colleagues accusing me of racism because I don't believe Meghan Markle,\" he tweeted.\n\"I demand an apology from those @TheTalkCBS bullies for their disgraceful slurs against ME.\"\nThe row began when Osbourne spoke in defence of Morgan, her former colleague on America's Got Talent, after he left Good Morning Britain on Tuesday.\n\"@piersmorgan I am with you. I stand by you,\" she tweeted. \"People forget that you're paid for your opinion and that you're just speaking your truth.\"\nWhen Underwood raised the tweet with her on Wednesday's episode of The Talk, Osbourne said: \"I feel like I'm about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is racist, so that makes me a racist.\"\n\"For me at 68 years of age to have to turn around and say, 'I ain't racist', what's it got to do with me? How can I be racist about anybody\u2026 or anything in my life?\"\nAs she grew increasingly frustrated, her language was bleeped out and Underwood took the programme to a commercial break.\nWhen they returned, Osbourne tearfully asked Underwood in a raised voice: \"I will ask you again Sheryl... And don't try and cry because if anyone should be crying, it should be me... Where you have heard him say racist things? Educate me. Tell me.\"\nUnderwood replied: \"It is not the exact words of racism, it's the implication and the reaction to it.\n\"To not want to address that because she is a black woman, and to try to dismiss it or to make it seem less than what it is, that's what makes it racist.\"\nShe added that Osbourne was her friend, and she didn't think of her as racist.\n\"I think it's too late, I think that seed's already sown,\" Osbourne said.\nThe clip circulated widely on social media. \"This is Sharon Osbourne, telling a black woman not to cry and demanding a definition of racism, as she sobs over Piers Morgan who walked off his job bc [because] a mixed black coworker calmly challenged his fixation on Meghan Markle,\" comedian Rae Sanni wrote.\n\"No one should be surprised by Sharon Osbourne's behaviour,\" added pop culture commentator Shar Jossell. \"She has been consistently loud in her willful stupidity (about race) throughout the years.\n\"The public gaslighting might be a new lil twist tho.\"\nIn her lengthy apology, Osbourne referred to her original tweet about Morgan, saying: \"Please hear me when I say I do not condone racism, misogyny or bullying. I should have always have been more specific about that in my tweet.\n\"I will always support freedom of speech, but now I see how I unintentionally didn't make that clear distinction. \n\"I hope we can collectively continue to learn from each other and from ourselves so we can all continue to pave the way for much-needed growth and change.\"\nSeparately, Morgan thanked the 200,000 people who have signed a petition calling for his return to Good Morning Britain, but said he wouldn't be coming back.\n\"Normally, people start petitions to have me fired or deported, so this is a pleasant surprise,\" he said.\nHis former co-presenter Alex Beresford, whose on-air criticism caused Morgan to storm off the show hours before he announced his permanent departure on Tuesday, has also addressed the matter for the first time.\n\"I didn't want him to quit, but I did want him to listen,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Over the last few years, Piers and I have had a lively, cheeky on-air relationship.\n\"We both wanted to be on the show on Tuesday morning, and, from our very public conversations on Twitter, we both knew how strongly our opinions differed on the treatment of Harry and Meghan pre and post the interview that has split the world.\n\"I hoped we could reach a place of understanding. It's sad that we weren't able to get there, but challenging his opinion was not an outrage. On this occasion, we have to agree to disagree.\"\nHe concluded by praising the presenter: \"Personally, Piers has always supported my growth. He's given me advice on several occasions and for that I am grateful. I wish him well.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A former prisoner has been convicted of planning an Islamic State-inspired sword attack.\nSahayb Abu, 27, was found guilty by a jury of preparing an act of terrorism and will be sentenced on 9 April.\nMuhamed Abu, his 32-year-old brother, was acquitted of failing to warn police about the plan.\nSahayb's preparations included buying a sword, a knife, balaclavas, fingerless gloves, and a combat vest, and paying extra to have the sword sharpened.\nWhen placing the orders, he asked if the vest could stop bullets.\nThe defendant, from Dagenham in east London, also met an undercover police officer hoping he could provide access to firearms, the Old Bailey heard.\nSahayb did not react as the majority verdict was delivered in his case and was remanded into custody. Muhamed, who was brought into court separately, wept and shouted out that his brother was a \"clown\".\nSahayb is one of several extremist siblings from the same London family:\nSahayb and Muhamed Abu were arrested in July in armed raids, hours after Sahayb had told an extremist chat group: \"We need a 9/11 2.0.\"\nThe authorities had intervened to prevent delivery of the 18-inch (46cm) sword and protective vest.\nMuhamed denied knowing that his brother was planning an attack. \nProsecutors said Sahayb's violent mindset was expressed in a series of homemade rap recordings in which he rhymed about \"sending bombs\".\nAnother lyric said: \"I'm trying to see many Lee Rigby's heads rolling on the ground\". Fusilier Rigby was murdered by two extremists near Woolwich barracks in May 2013.\nIn some self-made films, Sahayb wore a mask and camouflage hat, which prosecutors said was an outfit he planned to wear to conduct his attack.\nIn one he says he's \"just waiting on the body armour\" that \"will stop a bullet\".\nSahayb told jurors he had created a rapper character called the \"masked menace\" as a joke, aspired to be a charitable figure like Captain Tom Moore, and claimed he could not have a radical Islamist mindset because he watched pornography.\nThe counter-terror investigation that first uncovered the activities of the defendants' half-brother and sister came about after police received a tip that Sahayb and Muhamed were going to burgle a jewellery shop, the court was told.\nThe pair, along with Ahmed Aweys, later admitted their part in the burglary conspiracy.\nEvidence gathered by police showed family members justifying crime against \"kuffar\" (unbelievers), for the purpose of jihad.\nThe trial heard that Sahayb, after being released from prison in March last year, frequently accessed IS propaganda and used various social media platforms to boast about his violent beliefs.\nIn jail, he had mixed with terrorist prisoners, including a man jailed for encouraging violence against Prince George.\nIn one online comment, Sahayb stated: \"Islam is for war, hostage taking, killing infidels, fighting tyranny, taking war booty, taking women of the enemy as concubines.\"\nHe demonstrated particular hatred for Shia Muslims, railing against a specific UK imam, and searched online for the 2014 Camp Speicher Massacre in Iraq, when Islamic State forces killed more than 1,500 militiamen and Iraqi Army cadets, particularly targeting Shias.\nSahayb also joined a small private chat group, which contained the undercover police officer,  in which members from the around the world glorified IS atrocities.\nUsing an alias, Sahayb discussed Osama bin Laden, the hate preacher Anjem Choudry, and lionised the killer who carried out the Westminster Bridge attack in 2017.\nDuring a meeting with the undercover officer, Sahayb expressed regret at not going to Syria when he could have done, but said that two brothers had and they were martyrs.\nOn another occasion, the court was told, a surveillance team watched Sahayb and Muhamed meet in public and look at an online listing for the sword.\nDuring message chats with Muhamed and their teenage brother, Sahayb said there was \"something called biding your time waiting for right moments\" and that Allah would make them \"action men and not chatty men\".\nReferring to not travelling to Syria, he wrote \"the caravan left without us\".\nCommander Richard Smith, head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command, described Sahayb as a \"very dangerous individual\".\nHe said: \"I have no doubt in my mind of his murderous intent in preparing to carry out a terrorist attack.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nLockdown is being eased in Wales from Saturday, with four adults from two households able to socialise outdoors, some outdoor sports facilities reopening and solo visitors allowed into care homes. The Welsh government says all primary pupils can return to class from Monday, when hairdressers will also reopen for appointments. Non-essential shopping will gradually resume from 22 March.\nRules on meeting people outdoors in Scotland have also been relaxed, with up to four adults from two households able to meet in private gardens. Four people aged 12-17 can meet even if they are all from different households, while outdoor non-contact group sports for adults have also restarted. \nWinter lockdowns across the UK contributed to a 2.9% contraction in the economy in January, according to the Office for National Statistics. Deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow says as well as shops being closed, manufacturing saw its first decline since last April. He called it a \"notable hit, albeit smaller than some expected\". The Bank of England had expected the economy to shrink by 5%.\nRoyal Mail is to trial Sunday parcel deliveries for major retailers in response to the online shopping boom accelerated by the pandemic. The company says it has \"processed unprecedented parcel volumes\" in the past year and the trial with a number of brands will open the door to package deliveries seven-days-a-week.\nThe BBC will provide further learning support to teachers and pupils from April, in the form of a three-hour Bitesize Learning Zone on CBBC and BBC iPlayer on school days. It will initially feature archive content until the introduction in May of new programming, which the corporation's Patricia Hidalgo says will be \"full of fun to help kids learn and catch-up\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can check how many cases there have been in your area.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Wales has given 84% of people eligible for Covid boosters a vaccination, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales.\nThe programme has slowed down since before Christmas, delivering 3,752 booster doses a day in the last week.\nAt its height, 50,524 doses were given out on 21 December.\nTwo-thirds of vaccines given out in the past weeks were boosters, while more than 13,000 second doses, mainly to 12 to 15-year-olds.\nPeople can receive a booster three months after receiving their second vaccine, so it means that 84% of those eligible for a booster vaccine have now been reached in Wales.\nThat figure on 27 January was also 84% in Scotland, 81% in England and 75% in Northern Ireland.\nTo reach the remaining eligible people, at the current rate, it would take just over three months.\nThe situation is complicated by those who catch Covid having to wait before they can receive a booster, with higher proportions of the 18 to 40 age group infected since Christmas.\nThe total is 1,875,473 boosters given out by 27 January.\nThese include more than 42% of 18 to 29-year-olds and more than half of those in their 30s.\nWe can see that by last Sunday, 68% of adults had received their booster jab.\nMonmouthshire (78.6%) had reached the most and Cardiff (61.7%) the fewest.\nWith the over-50s, Monmouthshire has reached more than 88% and Powys, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend and Caerphilly more than 87%. Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "text": "Equalities Minister Liz Truss says the government will bring forward plans to ban gay conversion therapy \"shortly\". \nA No 10 source later said there had been no change in government policy.\nBut after a week of confusion over how far the government would go in stopping the practice, campaigners cautiously welcomed the change in tone.\nJayne Ozanne - who quit as a government LGBT+ adviser over the issue - welcomed the commitment, but said she was \"holding [her] breath\" for the outcome.\nAsked if a ban should be put into law, Boris Johnson said people should \"be in no doubt we will deal with this issue\".\nBut speaking after Ms Truss, he did not go as far as promising legislation, adding: \"It's technically complex to deal with, but we're determined to take further steps to stamp it out\".\n\"Conversion therapy\" refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.\nThe practice is already outlawed in Switzerland and parts of Australia, Canada and the US.\nBoth Mr Johnson and his predecessor, Theresa May, have made pledges to ban gay conversion therapy in the UK, with the current PM calling it \"absolutely abhorrent\".\nBut when the issue was debated in Parliament on Monday following a petition calling for a ban, MPs reacted angrily after no timeline was set out to bring it into law. \nIn her response to the debate, Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch also did not use the word \"ban\" - instead saying while the practice had \"no place in a civilised society\" - there were \"robust\" laws already in place to deal with the most troubling examples.\nShe added that the government did not \"intend to stop those who wish to seek spiritual counselling as they explore their sexual orientation\".\nThe comments were followed in the week by a string of resignations from the government's LGBT+ Advisory Panel - with accusations the Conservatives were creating a \"hostile environment\" for those in the community - and calls for Ms Badenoch to resign. \nSpeaking to reporters about the issue for the first time this week, Ms Truss said the government was \"very committed to LGBT equality\".\nShe added: \"We've recently brought forward plans to improve health care for transgender people, and will shortly be bringing forward plans to ban conversion therapy, which is an abhorrent practice.\"\nMs Ozanne said she would be \"looking carefully\" at what the government brought forward. \nShe added: \"I'm glad to hear her commit to a ban. However, I am holding my breath to see what that means.\n\"Kemi Badenoch, in her speech the other day, seemed to be leaving the stable door open so the primary form of conversion therapy, in religious settings, could continue to happen.\"\nLBGT+ campaigner Peter Tatchell, who has accused the government of \"dithering\" over its pledge, also said he would \"not let up until we see the details and timetable of the new law\". \nHe added: \"The ban must protect trans people and apply to religious practices. It is time to stop dithering and get this done.\"\nA No 10 source told the BBC there had been no change in government policy since Monday's debate, meaning it is still unclear whether a law to ban the practice will be introduced in Parliament or not. \nDuring a visit to Queen's University Belfast, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"I think this practice is repulsive and I think it's abhorrent, and I'm sorry these advisers have gone, but be in no doubt that we will deal with this issue.\n\"It is technically complex to deal with but we're determined to take further steps to stamp it out.\""

      "tags": "GDP,UK economy,Brexit,Office for National Statistics,Trade",
      "text": "UK goods exports to the European Union fell 40.7% in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while imports tumbled 28.8%.\nThe figures show the biggest drop since records began in 1997, and are the first since new trading rules between the UK and the EU came into force.  \nThe ONS said temporary factors were likely to be behind much of the falls.\nMeanwhile, new data showed the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown.\nThe economy is 9% smaller than it was before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBoth imports from and exports to the EU fell \"markedly\" in January, the ONS said. The value of goods exported from the UK to the EU fell by \u00a35.6bn in January 2021, while imports from the EU dropped by \u00a36.6bn. \nThe ONS said the fall in goods coming into the country were largely seen in machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals from the EU. \nCar imports, as well as medicinal and pharmaceutical products, were particularly affected.\nAccountancy firm KPMG pointed to Brexit as the likely culprit for the plunge in trade between the UK and the EU. In contrast, the UK's trade with non-EU countries grew by 1.7% in January. \nKPMG said intense stockpiling in December 2020 had brought some trade flows ahead of the Brexit deadline.  \nThe ONS said companies may have been using up that stock instead of buying new goods in January.\nIn addition, the end of the temporary trading arrangement between the UK and the EU coincided with the discovery of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK, which caused further complications and delays, after lorry drivers were required to take tests before crossing the border at the English Channel. \nThe figures are the first since the Brexit transition period ended and show the steepest falls since comparable records began.\nHowever, the ONS said data showed that things had begun to pick up. Firms were reporting that trade was getting easier and trade levels started to recover towards the end of the month. \nThe number of businesses saying they were unable to export between the middle and the final week of January had fallen by 5.4%, it said, and those saying they could not import had dropped by 3%.\nThe ONS said the data for the period was \"erratic\", while Goldman Sachs called it \"noisy\", meaning there was a lot going on and it was too early to tell how much of the fall was a temporary blip.\nHowever, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Suren Thiru, said: \"The significant slump in UK exports of goods to the EU, particularly compared to non-EU trade, provides an ominous indication of the damage being done to post-Brexit trade with the EU by the current border disruption.\n\"The practical difficulties faced by businesses on the ground go well beyond just teething problems and with disruption to UK-EU trade flows persisting, trade is likely to be a drag on UK economic growth in the first quarter of 2021.\"\nA government spokesperson said:  \"A unique combination of factors, including stockpiling last year, Covid lockdowns across Europe, and businesses adjusting to our new trading relationship, made it inevitable that exports to the EU would be lower this January than last.\n\"This data does not reflect the overall EU-UK trading relationship post Brexit and, thanks to the hard work of hauliers and traders, overall freight volumes between the UK and the EU have been back to their normal levels since the start of February.\"\nThe Office of National Statistics was keen to add the relevant health warnings alongside the Brexit trade figures this morning. \nSome of the drop in both imports and exports may be attributable to firms on both sides of the channel stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period - so they didn't need to move as many goods in January. Some will also be down to the pandemic and in some industries that's difficult to disentangle from any Brexit effect.\nNevertheless, as economists have noted this morning, there's no sugar-coating a fall of 40.7% in exports of goods to the European Union in January, our first month under the new trade agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson and signed on Christmas Eve.\nFrom the time of the referendum, the BBC has been highlighting the danger that it's not just tariffs that could jeopardise exports. The additional risk, well-known and well-discussed in Parliament, has always been that non-tariff barriers - such as vet checks on meat and poultry to the European Union - will boost exporters' costs sharply.\nThese costs will have to be passed on in higher prices, sharply reducing exporters' competitiveness. And that's if they can pull off the no-mean-feat of getting their goods across the Channel at all. The deal simply didn't get rid of non-tariff barriers to trade. Food exporters especially are now feeling the impact. \nThe ONS said January's contraction in the economy, down 2.9%, was a \"notable hit\".\nRetailers, restaurants and hairdressers were all affected by the latest Covid-19 lockdown.\nJonathan Athow from the ONS, said. \"Manufacturing also saw its first decline since April with car manufacturing falling significantly.\"However, increases in health services from both vaccine rollout and increased testing partially offset the declines in other industries.\"\nEconomic activity in health stood out, increasing by 8.7%, mainly through Covid testing and vaccine schemes.\nPantheon Economics noted a 28.1% drop in output from the food services and accommodation sectors between December and January which \"reflected many cafes and restaurants giving up on offering takeaway and delivery services, while the pandemic was raging\".\nIt also said households \"slammed the brakes on discretionary expenditure\", sending retail and wholesale output down 9%. \nThe contraction during January reflects a difficult period for the economy as the third lockdown kicked in.\nBut it was much smaller than expected and commentators in the main struck a positive note. \nPantheon Economics said the GDP figures were \"less dreadful than expected\".\nCapital Economics said the drop was smaller than during last April's lockdown, which fell 18.3% on the month.\nIts UK economist, Paul Dale, said: \"Overall, January's lockdown left the economy in a fairly big hole. But the government's easing roadmap has provided the ladder and the vaccinations are providing the willingness to climb out of it. \n\"By early next year, we think the economy will be peaking (sic) its head out of the top as GDP returns to the pre-pandemic level.\"\nKPMG said: \"Once restrictions are eased the economy is expected to pick up quickly, aided by the significant support the government has put in place. We expect growth of 4.6% this year.\"\u202f "

He would serve a five-year term starting in June.  \nGreenpeace International, which helped spearhead outside opposition to Mr Cormann's candidacy, called his selection a \"missed opportunity\" for the group, which includes the US, UK, Germany and Japan among others.\n\"We have little confidence in Mr Cormann's ability to ensure the OECD is a leader in tackling the climate crisis when he himself has an atrocious record on the issue, including opposition to carbon pricing,\" executive director Jennifer Morgan said. \n\"This was a missed opportunity for the OECD member states to draw a line in the sand and disqualify anyone with a history of blocking climate action from senior international appointments.\"\nMr Cormann has responded to the criticism, saying he was \"absolutely committed to ambitious and effective action on climate change\", but that there were different ways to achieve it. \nAs the next leader of the Paris-based OECD, Mr Cormann is facing an agenda that includes tackling the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, addressing climate change and reaching a global deal on how to tax technology companies.\nA native German speaker who was born in Belgium, Mr Cormann moved to Australia in his mid-20s, working in health insurance and politics.\nHe holds the record as the country's longest-serving finance minister, serving from 2013 to 2020. He also represented western Australia as a Liberal Party senator from 2007 to 2020.\nKnown to favour lower taxes, he pledged during his campaign for the OECD job to deploy \"every policy and analytical capability available through the OECD to help economies around the world achieve global net-zero emissions by 2050\".\nThe group should help identify \"market-based ... solutions which maximise reduction outcomes in a way that preserves energy affordability and is economically responsible\" he added.\nAustralia Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed the selection as a win for his country, calling it \"the most senior appointment of an Australian candidate to an international body for decades,\" in a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald.\nOECD insiders said that the breadth of Mr Cormann's political experience and personality played a role in his selection as did his detailed knowledge of the issues in hand. Backing from the US was also reportedly key.\nInsiders also told the BBC that having an Australian in charge would provide good geopolitical balance for an organisation based in the heart of Europe. The most recent country to join was Colombia, and Costa Rica is in the process of doing so.\nHowever, there has also been criticism over the lack of transparency in the selection process, which was led by the UK. \nOne observer described it as \"cloak and daggers\" and questioned whether that was appropriate for an organisation whose members are democracies.\nFormer EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m was the other finalist of the 10 candidates who entered the contest to succeed Mexico's Angel Gurria, who has led the group for 15 years.\nThe possible selection of Mr Cormann prompted debate in the UK, which is set to host an important climate change summit in Glasgow later this year. \nIn December Labour's Shadow International Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to Boris Johnson saying that supporting Mr Cormann \"would make a mockery of your own claims to leadership on climate change and would send entirely the wrong signal to the world about how seriously the UK takes the issue\"."

      "text": "Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers.\nCyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack.\nIt comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems.\nBut some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos.\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses.\nMeanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly.\nThe hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium.\nMicrosoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies.\nThe attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world.\nMicrosoft released software updates for the so called \"zero-day\" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves.\nHowever, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected.\nAccording to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries. \nCyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves.\n\"As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,\" Jake Moore at Eset said.\n\"The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers.\"\nA webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network. \nOnce installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks.\nGlobally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK.\nCyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems.\nCyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour.\nThe companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail.\nSean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: \"It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems.\n\"It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind. \n\"There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.\""

      "text": "Countries should not stop using AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine over fears it causes blood clots as there is no indication this is true, the World Health Organization says.\nBulgaria, Denmark and Norway are among the countries that have paused its use.\nBut on Friday a WHO spokeswoman said there was no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\nMargaret Harris said it was an \"excellent vaccine\" and should continue to be used.\nAround 5 million Europeans have already received the AstraZeneca jab.\nThere have been about 30 cases in Europe of \"thromboembolic events\" - or developing blood clots - after the vaccine was administered. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nThe WHO is investigating the reports, as it does any safety questions, Ms Harris said. \nBut no causal relationship had been established between the shot and the health problems reported, she said.\nOn Friday, AstraZeneca said the recorded number of blood clots in vaccinated people was \"significantly lower... than would be expected among the general population\".\n\"An analysis of our safety data of more than 10 million records has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis,\" a spokesperson said. \nBulgaria's decision to pause its rollout followed similar steps by Denmark, Iceland and Norway as well as Thailand. Italy and Austria have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure.\nThe European Medicines Agency, the EU's medicines regulator, said earlier there was no indication the jab was causing the blood clots.\nOther countries, including the UK, Germany, Australia and Mexico, have said they are continuing their rollout.\nWhile vast numbers of people are being vaccinated at pace around the world, some of them will still get sick with other things unrelated to the vaccine. \nThese pauses for the AstraZeneca vaccine are not because it is unsafe to give. It's to allow time for experts to explore why a small number of people who were recently give the shot also developed blood clots.\nWhen an illness occurs shortly after vaccination, it is right to question whether the shot might have contributed in any way. \nThere is no indication or evidence, however, that the vaccine was linked or responsible. \nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring. Europe's drug regulator has also backed the vaccine, saying its benefits are clear. Covid can be deadly and vaccination saves lives. \nGermany's Health Minister Jens Spahn said he disagreed with the countries suspending the vaccinations.\n\"From what we know so far, the benefit... is far greater than the risk,\" he said.\nThe temporary suspensions come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the doses.\nIn the latest upset, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz complained that the EU was not distributing coronavirus vaccines fairly among member states - according to population size, as agreed. \nHe said some countries were striking side deals with vaccine makers instead of leaving procurement to the European Commission. \nThe German health ministry acknowledged in January that Germany had signed a deal for 30 million doses with Pfizer BioNTech in September.\nAlso on Friday, the WHO approved Johnson & Johnson's single-shot vaccine. It followed EU approval which was given on Thursday, while regulators in the United States, Canada and South Africa have also backed the drug.\nAfter cases declined in recent months, several European countries are now seeing a resurgence of the virus. France, Italy, Poland and Turkey have seen the highest numbers in recent weeks.\nThe whole of Italy is braced to enter the country's strictest lockdown measures over the Easter weekend, 3 to 5 April.\nUnder rules set to be confirmed by the government, residents will only be allowed to leave home for work, health reasons, essential shopping or emergencies. All non-essential shops will be closed as will bars and restaurants. School lessons must be held online. \nThe total number of deaths in Italy rose to 100,000 on Monday - the highest toll in Europe after the UK. Officials say infection rates are rising as new variants of the virus take hold. "

      "text": "Wales is on a \"knife edge\" and easing restrictions too quickly could lead to the \"exponential growth\" of Covid-19, a government scientific adviser has said.\nCases could be kept low if alert level three restrictions are in place until June and schools reopen gradually, a report to the Welsh Government advises.\nThe Welsh government is expected to announce a \"stay local\" rule on Friday.\nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford told the i newspaper he did not see life returning to normal in 2021.\nHe said Boris Johnson's wish to fully lift restrictions by 21 June was \"fanciful\" and warned another wave is \"inevitable\".\nThe report by the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) is based on modelling by scientists at Swansea University.\nA rush to return to school, combined with a faster easing of restrictions, could lead to a larger third wave of cases, according to the report, which was published last month but made public on Thursday.\nThe TAC has said all the modelling and conclusions still apply.\nThe co-chairwoman of the TAC, Fliss Bennee, said it was a crucial moment in the course of the pandemic.\n\"We are sitting at a knife edge, where if we start to unlock too fast then we will be in a period of exponential growth that could bring us easily back to the sort of levels of hospitalisations and deaths we saw in January,\" she said.\nOn Wednesday, UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty warned against easing lockdown too quickly.\nThe modelling is neither a prediction nor a forecast, but suggests the likely impact on infections, serious illness and death of the greater mixing allowed by the easing of restrictions.\nIn its report, TAC warns there remain \"uncertainties\" around the impact of school reopening on transmission, the population's adherence to social distancing and other precautions, as well as the impact of vaccines on transmission. \nThe report adds: \"As the vaccine rollout continues, the horizon looks more positive in terms of expecting lower numbers of Covid-19 deaths than have been observed in November 2020 - January 2021.\" \nLooking specifically at schools, the report says the gradual return of students should not lead to another wave of cases, hospitalisations or deaths as long as adherence with other restrictions remains high.\nBut if adherence wanes \"there may be a resurgence of the virus around May-June time, especially if the new variant adds around an initial 0.6 to the R number\", the report says.\nR is the rate at which the virus spreads, and an R value above one indicates the epidemic is growing.\nThe report also warns against relying on vaccines alone to end the pandemic.\nIt says: \"Vaccines are not 100% effective so not all at-risk groups are protected, even with full coverage.\n\"The modelled ratio of deaths to cases in May 2021 is around one quarter of the ratio in January 2021.\"\nThe scientists say that the results of the modelling \"may reinforce the need to be cautious with loosening restrictions and monitor outcomes over time, if a further wave of cases, hospitalisations and deaths is to be avoided\".\nIn a most likely scenario - assuming the new Kent virus variant is dominant, the vaccine is 75% effective and there is a cautious move out of lockdown - this could lead to 57,866 more Covid cases and about 800 deaths.\nBut a worst-case scenario - with a quick move out of lockdown, a bigger impact from the new variant and low adherence to the rules - could mean more than 194,000 further cases and almost 3,500 more deaths.\nBut even here, the vaccine would help mitigate what would otherwise be a worse third wave.\nThe scientific advisers say there is still some uncertainty about the effectiveness of the vaccine in how it may slow transmission.\nThere is also the issue that about a quarter of hospital admissions with Covid still involve people under 60 years old, so they are stressing that everyone still has a part to play in keeping to basic rules, especially before all adults have had the vaccine.\nThere is hope people now understand more about the virus, and scientists have noted how people were cautious in how they behaved after the end of the firebreak last November.\nMs Benee said when scientific advisers looked at the models, they told politicians they should unlock \"really slowly and really carefully\".\nShe added: \"If we go cautiously, if we are able to keep transmission low enough, then there's no reason why we won't be able to avoid having a third wave during the summer entirely.\"\nThe case rate in Wales as a whole was, for a period in December, one of the highest in the world. But it has been falling since the week before Christmas.\nFor more than a month, Wales has had the lowest case rate of the UK nations and is at its lowest level since 18 September.\nAt 43.9% it is below the \"trigger\" figure of 50 cases per 100,000, normally used as the guide for bringing in restrictions.\nThe youngest children have already returned to school in Wales, with all other primary school pupils due to go back on Monday.\nSecondary schools will be able to welcome pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 for \"check-in\" sessions before they are due back fully from mid-April.\nExercise rules were eased on 20 February to allow four people from a maximum of two households to meet outdoors for exercise.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford previously said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believed a third wave was being \"baked into what will happen during this year\"."

Whether there's evidence for inflammation in the brain that may be persisting, and whether there's been damage enough to to actually kill nerve cells in the brain that may cause some shrinkage.\u201d\nThese scans will be repeated over the coming years - and made available to researchers all around the world.\nThe team says our understanding of the health legacy of Covid is just beginning.\nFollow @BBCMorelle on Twitter"

      "text": "The city of Minneapolis has reached a $27m (\u00a319m) settlement with the family of George Floyd, the unarmed US black man whose death last May sparked protests worldwide.\nMr Floyd's death after being trapped under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin was captured on camera.\nLawyers for the family said the footage created \"undeniable demand for justice and change\". \nJury selection for Mr Chauvin's murder trial is currently under way. \nSix out of 12 jurors have been selected for hearings beginning on 29 March.\nThe Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to approve the pre-trial settlement, the largest ever awarded in the state of Minnesota.\n\"That the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever would be for the life of a black man sends a powerful message that black lives do matter and police brutality against people of colour must end,\" said Floyd family attorney Ben Crump.\nIn a video of Mr Floyd's death that went viral on social media, four police officers confront the man for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local shop.\nThey drag him to the ground and Mr Chauvin places his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, even as he begs for his life and says \"I can't breathe\". He was later pronounced dead in hospital.\nLawyers for the Floyd family filed a civil suit one month later, in June 2020.\nThey argued the city had been negligent for failing to train officers in proper restraint techniques and for not dismissing officers with a poor track record. Dozens of complaints had previously been filed against Mr Chauvin, who had been serving on the city police force for 19 years. \nSpeaking after the settlement was announced, Mr Crump said it was but \"one step\" on the journey to justice. Mr Floyd's death was a catalyst for reckoning on race and bias, he said. \nThe civil settlement comes at the end of the first week in criminal court proceedings over Mr Chauvin's murder trial.\nThe former officer is facing charges of second and third degree murder and second degree manslaughter. If found guilty on all counts, he could face a maximum sentence of 65 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.\nSix jurors have been selected for the trial so far.\nThe final bench will require 12 jurors and four alternates - or substitutes - but suitable jurors have been hard to find in this emotionally charged and high-profile case.\nThe three other officers involved in Mr Floyd's death - J Alexander Keung, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane - were charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter, and will be tried separately later this year."

More than 23 million people have had a first dose of coronavirus vaccine.\nAccording to the ONS statistics, there are around 231,400 people in the community with the virus, or around one in every 280 people in the UK is infected.\nThat's an improvement on last week's figure of one in every 230. \nIt is too soon to predict, from these statistics, what effect the reopening of schools might have on infection rates going forward, say experts.\nThe ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, show:\nThere are \"early signs\" of a possible increase in the percentage of people testing positive in the South East and South West of England, says the ONS. \nRates have decreased in the North East, North West, East Midlands, East of England and London, and the trend is uncertain in Yorkshire and The Humber and the West Midlands. \nBut caution should be taken in over-interpreting the small changes, it says. \nThe estimates for people testing positive for the virus are:"

      "text": "A Met Police officer has been charged with the kidnap and murder of 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard. It means criminal proceedings are under way but, with the justice system creaking under a massive backlog, how long might it be before a trial could take place?\nTo start with, Wayne Couzens will be taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court for his first court appearance. \nAll such proceedings start at the magistrate level, where a defendant confirms personal details such as their name, date of birth and where they live. Serious crimes, known as indictable offences, are always sent up to crown court.\nThe 48-year-old will then appear at crown court - most likely the Central Criminal Court in London, which is better known as the Old Bailey.\nA judge will listen to the background of the case and can grant or refuse bail - although it is extremely rare for someone accused of murder to be granted bail. The judge will also set a date for a plea hearing and, should Mr Couzens plead not guilty, he will go on to be tried by a jury.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a backlog that stands at an estimated 56,000 crown court cases in England and Wales. \nAbout 65% of the crown court backlog is believed to be made up of trials, and many will not go before a jury until 2022 at the earliest. The other cases are sentencing hearings and plea preparations.\nDue to the pandemic, social distancing measures have had to be put in place. This means not all trials in the past year have been able to be heard in court buildings, which often have very cramped conditions.\nSo finding a suitable courtroom could take some time, as dates have already been set for other trials.\nMr Couzens has been charged with murder and has already been remanded into custody.\nCustody ahead of a trial carries a time limit which is currently eight months, but this can be reviewed, extended or cut by a judge.\nThere are protocols in place to expedite the most serious cases, both in the interests of public protection and management of dangerous offenders on remand.\nAny trial could well take place this year, should it be fast-tracked.\nParticularly now there has been a charge in the case, people need to be especially cautious about what they post about it on social media.\nPosts should not include comments claiming or implying that any suspect is guilty of an offence of which they have been accused, nor anything else that could prejudice a trial or impede the administration of justice.\nThis is because, according to English law, everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty and everyone has the right to a fair trial.\nCriminal proceedings against Mr Couzens have been \"active\" since his arrest.\nThis means that under contempt of court laws, nothing should be published that could cause a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing or impeding the legal process, for example by influencing potential jurors.\nCommissioner Dame Cressida Dick said that the arrest of a serving police officer on suspicion of murder had caused anger both within the Met and with the general public.\nAs is usual, because one of its own has been arrested, the Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) as well as its in-house Directorate of Professional Standards.\nBoth are responsible for investigating complaints about the professional conduct of officers.\nThe IOPC has also launched an investigation into the Met's initial handling of the missing person investigation.\nMs Everard's last known movements were at about 21:30 GMT on 3 March, shortly after she got off the phone to her boyfriend.\nIt took roughly 36 hours for police to make their initial appeal for information about the whereabouts of the marketing executive.\nBut the findings of investigations into the way the case was handled would not be made public until after any murder trial."

      "tags": "Universities,Students,Reality Check,Young people,Brexit",
      "text": "The government has begun inviting applications for the Turing scheme, which will enable UK students to study in other countries.\nThe scheme is named after the mathematician Alan Turing, and replaces Erasmus, a European Union (EU) programme which UK students can no longer take part in.\nThe UK turned down an offer to continue participating in Erasmus after Brexit. \nUniversities minister Michelle Donelan said the Turing scheme would \"enable up to 35,000 students throughout the UK to work or study across the globe\".\nThe new scheme will provide funding \"towards placements and exchanges\" of students.\nUniversities and other organisations in the UK can apply for grants to help cover travel expenses and living costs as well as the administrative costs of running the scheme. \nApplications have to be made by bodies such as universities, further education colleges and schools. If they are successful, these bodies can invite their own students to apply for individual funding.\nThe Turing scheme will provide placements across the world. \nErasmus covers placements across the EU and some non-EU countries that pay to be part of the scheme. \nBoth schemes are open not only to university students but also those in vocational training, apprentices or those who are retraining through a college or school. \nErasmus offers placements for teaching and college staff and youth workers as well, but the Turing scheme will not.\nThe amount of money you get under Erasmus depends on where you are going and whether you are a student, apprentice, trainee or staff.\nThe Turing scheme will offer different amounts based on where you are going and for how long. \nFor example, a university student going to France for six months would get \u00a3335 (\u20ac390) per month under the Turing scheme, while the Erasmus scheme paid \u00a3317 (\u20ac370) per month in 2020-21.\nUK students did not have to pay tuition fees when studying abroad under Erasmus because the scheme was reciprocal - it allowed EU students to come and study in the UK as well.\nThe Turing scheme will not pay tuition fees for UK students studying abroad or for students from other countries studying in the UK. Instead, it expects the fees to be waived by the universities that take part.  \nUniversities Minister Michelle Donelan told the Today programme \"The way it'll work is our universities will partner with another university and they will waive the fees because they will be exchanging students.\" \nThe government has allocated \u00a3110m for the first year of the scheme, which starts in 2021/22, but it is not currently funded after that.\nBoth schemes offer support.\nErasmus pays an additional \u00a3103 (\u20ac120) per month - a total of \u00a3420 (\u20ac490) per month for a poorer student going to France for six months in the current academic year. \nThe Turing scheme would pay \u00a3445\u202f(\u20ac519) per month to the same student, but also contribute to travel costs (the amount will depend on how far the student is travelling). \nIt will also provide poorer applicants with additional expenses, such as the costs of visas, passports, and health insurance. \nAgain, both Erasmus and Turing offer support.\nThe Turing scheme website says that, unlike Erasmus, it will \"cover preparatory visits to carry out risk assessments and ensure participants will be able to equally access and take part in all elements of a placement\". \nStudents at universities in Northern Ireland will be able to participate in either scheme, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government.\nStudents at universities in Great Britain will only be eligible for Turing.\nSome UK students are still participating in Erasmus programmes using funding awarded before the end of 2020, which may allow them to continue until the end of the 2021-22 academic year, but no new funding will be available.\nSince Brexit, UK students have had to deal with immigration regulations in the EU. \nUK nationals are only able to stay in an EU country for 90 out of every 180 days without a visa (except for Ireland, which will still have free movement with the UK). \nThe government has published guidance for UK nationals planning to study in the EU, and encourages students consider wider issues such as health and travel insurance.\nYou can find UK government advice on countries around the world here.\nAlthough coronavirus is now affecting student mobility, figures from before the pandemic showed that about half of UK university students who studied abroad did so through Erasmus. \nIn 2017, 16,561 UK students participated in Erasmus, while 31,727 EU nationals came to the UK.\n\"The Erasmus+ programme has delivered and continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK and we need to ensure the positives of the programme are not lost as we move into the next stage,\" Jane Racz, the director of the programme in the UK, told BBC News last year.\n\"Since 2014, almost \u20ac1bn [\u00a3900m] of funding has been distributed to UK Erasmus+ projects, with over 930,000 participants involved.\"  \nThe National Union of Students has said the government's decision to replace Erasmus will \"damage\" the potential for many students to study abroad.\n\"Despite the claims of this government, they have not backed up the new Turing scheme with the funding required to support disadvantaged students to study abroad,\" Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice-president for higher education, said. \"This will harm the futures of thousands of students for years to come.\" \nKate Green MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, said government \"rhetoric on the Turing Scheme does not live up to the reality\". \nCorrection: This piece has been updated to make it clear that students from other countries will be able to study in the UK but they will not receive funding under the Turing scheme.\nWhat do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Clapham,Metropolitan Police Service,Battersea",
      "text": "A High Court hearing is under way after police said a planned vigil following the death of Sarah Everard would be \"unlawful\". \nLawyers representing the organisers of Saturday's event in London say the decision goes against human rights law.\nIn a statement, organisers Reclaim These Streets said they were told by the Metropolitan Police the event would not be allowed amid Covid restrictions.\nMs Everard was last seen alive on 3 March in Clapham, south London.\nReclaim These Streets said that by forcing them to cancel the vigil, the Met Police would be \"silencing thousands of women\" who want to \"stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets\". \nAs well as the vigil on Clapham Common, sister events are planned for other cities and towns including Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, St Andrews and Liverpool.\nSpeaking on a visit to Queen's University in Belfast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said \"no woman should walk our streets in fear\" and that the whole country would be \"united in their feeling\" for Ms Everard's family and friends.\nOn whether or not vigils should be allowed to go ahead this weekend, he said that the issue was before the courts now and was \"an operational matter for the Met\".\nScotland's health secretary Jeane Freeman has called on people not to take part in the Reclaim the Streets vigils, warning that it was not safe to do so while coronavirus was not under control.\nOn Friday, police confirmed that a body found in woodland in Kent on Wednesday had been identified as Ms Everard.\nA serving Metropolitan Police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to her disappearance and Scotland Yard is to be investigated over its handling of an allegation of indecent exposure against him.\nOne of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC meetings were ongoing with the Met and Lambeth Council, while the group were hopeful the High Court would be able to rule on the issue on Friday.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been an \"about-face\" by police, after the group had initially been told they were looking at ways to navigate the difficulties.\nShe said organisers were \"put under increasing pressure\" and told they would be at risk for organising the event, along with everybody who attended.\nMs Birley added that organisers had emphasised the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and had chosen Clapham Common due to its open nature.\nMPs have called for the vigil to be allowed to go ahead, with Conservative Caroline Nokes saying she had asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to step in.\nThe chair of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee said the Met Police appeared to have given organisers \"mixed messages\" and said the home secretary could \"send a very clear message that at this awful time\" when women wanted to express their sorrow at the tragic case. \nLabour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she hoped the event could go ahead and said \"women's voices cannot be silenced\".\nThe laws of the coronavirus restrictions are incredibly complicated - almost impossible to follow without repeated and careful reading. \nOn top of that, they leave many decisions on what's lawful or not to frontline police rather than spelling out exactly when and how they should enforce the rules. \nToday, no-one is allowed to leave home \"without reasonable excuse\", but the examples in the regulations are not exclusive.\nIn other words, it's open to interpretation whether a well-organised and Covid-safe demonstration would be lawful or not.\nOn top of that, every decision by the police to restrict a protest has to first consider the rights of freedom of assembly and speech. \nDuring last June's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, senior officers took a softly-softly approach and allowed them to take place. \nSo Reclaim These Streets want the High Court to say the police came down on the wrong side of the human rights balancing exercise - failing to respect the need to remember Sarah Everard and all women who have been victims of violence.\nIn the statement, Reclaim These Streets said the event was planned by a group of women \"who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community\".\n\"Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence,\" they said. \nThe organisers said they were aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, and had \"proactively reached out\" to Lambeth Council and the Met Police to ensure the event \"could safely and legally take place\". \nThe police initially said they were developing a local policing plan to allow the vigil to take place, according to the organisers. \nBut they added: \"Since this statement, the Metropolitan Police have reversed their position and stated the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act.\"\nHuman rights lawyers representing Reclaim These Streets have written to the Met challenging its interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the statement adds.\n\"Their view is that the Metropolitan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering[s] of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act,\" it says.\nIn a statement the Metropolitan Police said: \"We understand the public's strength of feeling and are aware of the statement issued by Reclaim The Streets with regard to a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common this weekend. \n\"We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations.\"\nMet Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said he knew the public felt \"hurt and angry\" and said he recognised wider concerns have been raised about the safety of women in public spaces in London."

      "text": "Organisers of a vigil planned for Sarah Everard in south London are still hopeful it can take place, despite effectively losing a High Court challenge against a ban on the event. \nBut the Metropolitan Police urged people to find a \"lawful and safer way\" to express views on women's safety.\nEarlier, a High Court judge refused to say the event would be permitted under coronavirus regulations.\nOrganisers Reclaim These Streets said discussions with police would continue.\nSaturday's event was planned after the disappearance of Ms Everard, 33, who was last seen alive on 3 March when she was walking home along a main road in Clapham, prompted public debate about women's safety.\nOn Friday, serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, was charged with the kidnap and murder of Ms Everard.\nAs well as the vigil on Clapham Common, sister events have been planned for other cities and towns including Cambridge, Cardiff, Leeds, St Andrews and Liverpool.\nReclaim These Streets said in a statement: \"We are now in discussions with the Met to confirm how the event can proceed in a way that is proportionate and safe - our number one priority.\"\nCommander Catherine Roper of the Met Police said the force's message to those wishing to attend vigils was \"stay at home or find a lawful and safer way to express your views\".\nShe added: \"I understand this ruling will be a disappointment to those hoping to express their strength of feeling, but I ask women and allies across London to find a safe alternative way to express their views.\"\nHowever, one of the group's barristers, Pippa Woodrow of Doughty Street Chambers, told the BBC the police statement was \"premature\". \n\"The ball is now effectively in the Met's court to tell the organisers how this event can take place lawfully,\" she said.\nIn the ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Holgate refused an application by Reclaim These Streets for the High Court to make \"an interim declaration\" that any ban on outdoor gatherings under Covid rules was \"subject to the right to protest\".\nThe judge also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the Met Police of \"prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances\" was unlawful.\nFollowing the decision, a government spokesman said: \"All of our thoughts are with Sarah's family and friends at this terrible time, and the government recognises why so many women and girls across the country want to pay their respects.\n\"We are still in the middle of a pandemic, which is why we urge people to do this safely and to continue to avoid mass gatherings.\"\nMr Justice Holgate hasn't quite closed the door on the event going ahead anyway.\nThat's because three long hours of legal argument thrashed out the legal principles that the Metropolitan Police should follow. \nCritically, the force said it did not have a \"blanket ban\" on all protests - which meant it accepted it had to take into account the right to protest which is enshrined in human rights legislation.\nThe judge said: \"There may well be further communication between the claimants and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should comment.\"\nWhat does that mean in practice? Well, we're now waiting to see whether there are talks - and whether some kind of vigil will be deemed to be lawful after all.\nOne of the organisers of the south London vigil, Anna Birley, told the BBC the group had \"consistently\" asked the Met Police \"to tell us what would be a safe way to exercise our right\". \nMeanwhile, Harriet Harman, the Labour MP for Camberwell and Brixton, tweeted: \"C'mon [Metropolitan Police] now agree a way for this vigil to happen safely.\n\"Many women want to show their concern.  Including women Met Police officers!\"\nLana Adamou, a lawyer with the human rights group Liberty, said protest was \"the lifeblood of a healthy democracy\" and that socially-distanced demonstrations were \"perfectly possible\".\n\"The current restrictions should be interpreted compatibly with our rights enshrined in the Human Rights Act and it is concerning that this hasn't been reflected today,\" she said.\nWhen asked whether the vigil should be allowed to go ahead, Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins said \"at the moment the law is as it is\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions: \"For my own part, I will be standing outside my front door and I will be reclaiming albeit a very small piece of pavement, but I will be standing out there to show my support and my respect and my solidarity with other women at this time.\"\nAt the hearing, the judge said the organisers were told by police that \"the vigil would be illegal and that their 'hands were tied' by Covid-19 regulations\".\nHe added that the four claimants \"were told that, as organisers, they would be liable to be issued with \u00a310,000 fixed penalty notices\", and could also be arrested.\n Mr Justice Holgate said it would not be \"appropriate for the court\" to make the declaration sought.\nHe ruled that \"the requirements of the law have been clearly stated\" in previous court rulings and concluded: \"I decline to grant the interim relief sought. But I hope that, in this judgment, I have clarified the application of the law in so far as it is appropriate for me to do so at this stage.\"\nLawyers representing the organisers earlier argued the Met's interpretation of Covid rules goes against human rights law.\nBut George Thomas, representing the Met, said the event could lead to significant crowds in a central London location, at a time when Parliament's intention was to not allow gatherings of more than two people for health reasons amid the pandemic.\nIn other developments, the government is seeking further views on how to tackle violence against women and girls following an outpouring of experiences shared online in response to the Sarah Everard case.\nThe Home Office is reopening a public consultation, which originally closed in February. \nThe findings will help inform its strategy on tackling violence against women and girls - due to be published in the summer."

      "text": "Women \"will be worried and may well be feeling scared\" after the disappearance of Sarah Everard, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick has said.\nOn social media, in WhatsApp groups and in Zoom calls across the country, women have been talking about the case of the 33-year-old, who went missing in Clapham, south London, on 3 March.\nA Met police officer continues to be questioned on suspicion of murder and kidnap after human remains were found during the search for her.\nSome women are sharing their anger, frustration and fear online - reflecting each others' experiences of walking alone on the streets.\n\"I learned from a very young age that I would have to change my behaviour in order to keep myself safe,\" Grace Jessup tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\"We're seeing a lot of women coming out and saying, 'we're tired of this, we're sick of this'. \n\"We're also kind of sick of the fact that this is a shock to men. \n\"This has been my reality, since I was about 14 years old, walking down the road in a school uniform and being harassed by passers-by.\" \nGrace says she never goes out without telling a friend to text her when they get home, or vice versa.\n\"If you don't, they'll follow up with you, and they'll make sure that you're safe. Because we have learned nobody is going to protect us.\"\nGrace used to live in Clapham, close to where Sarah Everard was last seen.\n\"She could have been me, she could have been any of my friends,\" she says.\nShe plans to go to a vigil planned on Saturday at Clapham Common.\n\"For me, it's not only a vigil, it's a space for us to just come together. This has hurt us, as young women.\n\"So I think it's important for us to gather, to acknowledge how that feels for us. And obviously, as a result pay tribute to her.\"\nDaisy Edwards lives five minutes' walk from the last place Sarah Everard was seen. She moved to the area a few months ago and also plans to go to the vigil on Saturday.\nShe saw the missing person posters around the streets last week.\n\"I'm really shocked at myself actually, how I didn't initially see the missing posters and take it seriously. I think maybe I've been desensitised to it.\"\nDaisy says she's used to taking precautions if walking somewhere alone, especially at night.\n\"If I feel that someone's following me I turn around and look at their face, or maybe stop to take a phone call - I've faked phone calls before.\"\nSome men are asking on social media what they can do to help women feel safe if they're walking alone.\nMost of the replies centre around giving women space on the street if you walk behind them or past them.\nBut some people are also very keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen.\n\"The issue with the argument is that women can't win,\" says Daisy.\n\"They want women to not treat all men as potential attackers, but then we also are asked to keep ourselves safe. \n\"Keeping ourselves safe means that we have to see everyone as potential attackers, because if we were to say, 'OK, not all men, we will treat everyone as innocent until proven guilty', that's when these things happen. \n\"And that's when people say, she should have been more careful. \n\"So it's really tough, because I think it's an attitude that's really built into society.\"\nShy can remember a few instances when she has felt scared walking in public on her own.\nTwo days ago, for example, on a lunchtime walk.\n\"I went past a couple of guys and I had my headphones on.\n\"I heard them make comments and I heard them say something like, 'oi, come over here.' I just ignored it carried on walking.\n\"And they said it again: 'Come over here, hey, I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.'\n\"That is wrong. Because if you're trying to get someone's attention, and she's not acknowledging you, she's ignoring you. You need to back off.\n\"If this had happened during the evening with headphones in, would someone say to me, 'oh, you shouldn't have your headphones in'? Or that I shouldn't have gone down that road?\"\n\"I want to make something very clear, I'm not saying every man is the problem. I do not think that at all,\" says Shy.\nBut, she says, she's already started making precautions for when she can go out more as lockdown restrictions ease.\n\"I was on the phone to my friend this morning. And we were already googling different apps that we can put on our phone in case of emergencies.

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has complained to Ofcom about Piers Morgan's comments about her on Good Morning Britain, the UK broadcast regulator has confirmed.\nOn the ITV breakfast show on Monday, Morgan said he \"didn't believe a word\" Meghan had told interviewer Oprah Winfrey about life in the Royal Family.\nThe duchess spoke about having suicidal thoughts and said she got no support.\nMore than 41,000 others have also complained to Ofcom about Morgan, who left the programme the following day.\nAn Ofcom spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm receipt of a standards complaint made on behalf of the Duchess of Sussex.\"\nThe watchdog has already opened a formal investigation into Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain. The duchess is also reported to have complained to ITV directly.\nOn the programme, Morgan picked up on Meghan's claim in the interview that her request to senior Buckingham Palace officials for help was rejected, after she told Oprah she had experienced suicidal thoughts.\n\"Who did you go to?\" he said. \"What did they say to you? I'm sorry, I don't believe a word she said, Meghan Markle. I wouldn't believe it if she read me a weather report.\n\"The fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible.\"\nOn Tuesday's episode, Morgan briefly walked out of the studio after clashing with weather presenter Alex Beresford during a discussion about the interview.\nThe controversial host's permanent departure was announced that evening. Morgan stood by his comments the following day, saying: \"Freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on.\"\nIt was also announced on Friday that the duke and duchess have donated to a new charity that aims to help young people from diverse backgrounds get into journalism.\nThe PressPad Charitable Foundation has been set up to \"improve social mobility\" in the British media through bursaries, mentoring, networking and accommodation.\nThe duke and duchess's Archewell Foundation is among the first donors, but it is not known how much money the couple have contributed.\nPressPad founder Olivia Crellin told BBC News the charity had been approached by the Sussex's team \"very recently\".\n\"They just wanted to give a gift as a part of a couple of organisations that they are donating to,\" she said. \"They felt that our mission and our values aligned with theirs.\"\nPrince Harry told Oprah the UK tabloid press was \"bigoted\" and creates a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear\".\nThe couple's interview has sparked scrutiny of the media and the role race has played in its coverage of Meghan.\nMeanwhile, Daily Mail and Mail Online owner Associated Newspapers is reported to have written to ViacomCBS, the makers of the interview, to complain that there was \"deliberate distortion and doctoring\" in a \"misleading\" montage of British newspaper headlines that was used in the programme.\nMeghan recently won a High Court privacy case against Associated Newspapers over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Most curbs to people's daily lives have been lifted as Wales moves to the lowest level of Covid rules.\nRules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have been removed, while nightclubs are able to reopen for the first time since measures brought in to tackle the spread of Omicron were introduced after Christmas.\nSocial distancing rules were also scrapped as Wales moved into alert level zero on 28 January.\nPeople who test positive for Covid must now isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nHowever masks are still required to be worn in most public places in Wales, including shops, hospitals and on public transport. \nBut they are no longer needed for bars and restaurants, and changes to rules due to be announced later, mean they will also no longer be needed when visiting someone in their own room at a care home.\nWhat do the changes mean for people and businesses in Wales, and what can you do and when?\nChanges to rules have been made over the last two weeks, after First Minister Mark Drakeford laid out his plan to ease restrictions by the end of January.\nThe changes saw:\nFrom Thursday, 10 February Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero\nThe lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic, we were last in alert level zero at Christmas.\nUnder it most curbs to our daily life are removed, all businesses are allowed to reopen, but people still have to wear face masks in many public places, and self isolation rules still apply.\nSince 22 December, fully vaccinated adults, children aged between five and 18 and vaccine clinical trial participants identified as a close contact of a positive case of Covid-19 in Wales do not need to self-isolate. \nInstead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

We're still being told to contact our friends when we get home, making sure we dress in bright clothing, making sure we don't walk in dark areas, we walk home in groups,\" she said.\n\"The conversation around safety of women is so focused on women that we don't think about the role men have to play in this as well.\"\nMost women \"don't know a woman who hasn't faced some sort of abuse or sexual violence in their life\", according to Cerys Furlong, chief executive of gender equality charity Chwarae Teg.\nShe said one in five girls and women aged 14 to 21 have experienced sexual harassment in public since the start of lockdown.\n\"We need to look quickly and clearly at why there are so few convictions and why as a society we don't have confidence in women and believe them when they speak out,\" Ms Furlong told BBC Radio Wales.\nThe chief constable of North Wales Police said Sarah Everard's death has \"brought into sharp focus the fact that everyone, wherever they are, should be able to live, work and walk our streets without fear of harassment, abuse or violence\". \nCarl Foulkes urged women to report \"any concerns about behaviour in complete confidence that the police will deal with that concern\".\n\"Tackling abuse and violence in all its forms is a priority for us. We are absolutely committed to doing all we can to prevent this and to prosecute those who commit or attempt to commit such offences,\" he said.\nThere have been calls from some for men to be given curfew in the wake of Ms Everard's disappearance.\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he was not considering a curfew on men after a row over comments he made on BBC Breakfast television.\nOn the show he said a curfew would not be not be \"top of the list\" to combat sexual harassment, he would be willing to \"consider all options\" if there was a \"crisis\".\nHe said the Welsh Government changed the rules over the winter to allow people to exercise with one other person to help keep people safe. \nAlthough the Welsh Parliament can create offences in areas controlled from Cardiff, most criminal law is controlled from Westminster.\nAfter Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said such a curfew would be \"barmy\", Mr Drakeford tweeted: \"We are NOT introducing a curfew for men in Wales - or even considering it. This is misleading and deliberately misses the real issue.\""

It said problems arose in a tiny fraction of the 2.3 billion rides during that time.\nIt later clashed with state regulators in California, who wanted access to the reports, ultimately leading to a fine.\nLyft has delayed publication of a similar report, citing the privacy disagreement. The company is also facing lawsuits from dozens of women in the US, who say they were harmed after the firm failed to protect passengers from its drivers.\nLyft is active in the US and Canada. Uber, which operates in 71 countries around the world, said the data-sharing initiative was limited to the US, with no plans to expand at this time. \nThe firm has faced concerns over its handling of safety incidents outside the US as well.\nIn the UK, Uber had its London licence suspended, in part because of safety concerns. However, in September last year, Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled the firm could continue operating, saying it had improved its record despite \"historical failings\"."

      "text": "A public inquiry has been announced into plans for the first new deep coal mine in the UK for decades.\nThe government had previously decided not to intervene in the project near Whitehaven in Cumbria, which was in the hands of local officials.\nBut ministers have taken control because of \"increased\" controversy.\nGreen campaigners say the mine will increase carbon emissions and send the wrong signal in the run-up to a UK-hosted climate conference in October.\nThe Woodhouse Colliery would extract coking coal for the steel industry from the seabed off St Bees, with a processing plant at Kells, in Whitehaven.\nCumbria County Council councillors, who have been assessing the project since 2017, gave it the go-ahead last March - but have since decided to review the application.\nLast month it was reported that the government's climate tsar, Alok Sharma, was apoplectic the plans for the coal mine had not been stopped.\nMr Sharma, who is in charge of preparations for the COP26 UN climate conference, has faced calls to resign over the issue.\nHe told MPs only last month that the mine was a \"local issue\" and would be decided by the council. \nBut the government has now decided to \"call in\" the application, meaning Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick will get the final say over it.\nIn a letter to Cumbria County Council, Mr Jenrick said the application had raised issues of \"more than local importance\".\nHe added the reversal had also been prompted by new advice on carbon emissions from government climate advisers published in December. \nHowever, a public inquiry will first be held by independent planners at the Planning Inspectorate. The inquiry process could take a number of months. \nAsked on Friday whether the government backed the mine or not, Boris Johnson said he couldn't get involved as it was now a \"qausi-judicial planning decision\".\nMP Trudy Harrison, whose Copeland constituency would include the mine, is a ministerial aide to the prime minister and has described opponents of the mine as being in \"cloud cuckoo land\".\nMs Harrison has yet to comment on the decision to hold an inquiry, but the Tory MP for nearby Workington, Mark Jenkinson, called the decision a \"capitulation to climate alarmists\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Cumbria, he said the \"screeching U-turn\" could open a \"Pandora's box\" over how the UK's contribution to climate change is measured.\nHe added there was \"nothing on the horizon\" to replace coking coal in the process for making steel, a sector that is due to play an important role in the UK's \"green recovery\".\nThe government could still decide to approve the mine, but given the amount of anger it's caused that seems unlikely - at least until after the UN climate conference. \nLocal Conservatives strongly supported the scheme and the employment it would bring. \nBut the government's climate advisers, along with a crowd of green groups, warned it would increase carbon emissions when the UK's committed to cutting them.\nWhat's more, it would harm Britain's international reputation before the UN conference, they said.\nOne of the world's leading climate scientists, the American James Hansen, warned Boris Johnson risked humiliation over the mine. \nThe US climate envoy John Kerry warned against it on Monday. And yesterday Alok Sharma was again rebuked by MPs over the plan.\nIt was too much pressure. \nProf Rebecca Willis and Prof Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University say the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than a million households.\nSupporters of the mine say that by producing coal to be used in Europe, the mine will reduce emissions from shipping coal from Australia or the USA.\nBut the mine proposal comes at a time when the government wants every sector of the UK economy to reduce CO2 emissions - not find new sources of carbon.  \nLabour's shadow environment secretary Ed Miliband said the government should \"block\" the mine and \"provide alternative jobs in the green industries of the future\".\n\"We owe people a long-term secure employment situation, the mine isn't the answer,\" he told reporters. \nHe added that whilst there was a \"current need\" for coking coal in steelmaking, \"all experts say over time the industry's going to need to move towards hydrogen as the answer\".\nLib Dem Tim Farron, MP for nearby Westmoreland and Lonsdale, said: \"In the year that Britain hosts COP26, it is blindingly obviously that we won't be taken seriously on the world stage with this coal mine hanging round our neck.\"\nHe added: \"I hope this public inquiry leads to these plans finally being axed, and the government instead looks at bringing well-paid, long-term, green jobs to Cumbria.\""

      "text": "Only one care home resident has been fully vaccinated in Ceredigion and nine over-80s in Pembrokeshire, Public Health Wales figures show. \nWhile nearly half of Torfaen's over-80s have had two doses of the Covid jab, it is only 0.1% in Pembrokeshire and 0.4% in Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion.\nHywel Dda University Health Board said a gap of more than eight weeks gives better \"long-term protection\".\nThe data gives a breakdown by local authority for the first time.\nThe latest figures released by Public Health Wales on Thursday show disparities between the numbers of people who have received their second dose of the coronavirus vaccine across Wales.\nAccording to the data, this does not appear to be a rural issue as Powys has fully vaccinated 41% of its care home residents and a third of its over-80s.\nCare Forum Wales, a group that represents more than 450 care homes in Wales, has said that while the Covid vaccine rollout in Wales \"has been a real success story\", these new figures are \"baffling and a cause for concern.\"\n\"Whilst the first dose will provide a good degree of immunity, it is important that people are able to have the second jab to provide better protection, particularly in the case of people aged over 80 who are generally more likely to be frail and therefore more vulnerable,\" said chairman Mario Kreft. \nHe added he would be seeking assurances that there will not be \"extreme fluctuations in future so that the distribution is fairer and more even across Wales\".\nNearly half of the over-80s age group has been fully vaccinated in Torfaen and a third in Newport, but this drops to just 0.1% in Pembrokeshire, where just nine people in this age group have got a second dose. \nAge Cymru said it is \"important\" older people get their second dose \"within the recommended timescales to get maximum protection from the vaccine\" so they can start \"to live their lives again and re-engage with communities.\"\n\"We will monitor the situation closely to make sure that targets for the second dose are being met across Wales,\" said chief executive Victoria Lloyd.\nRos Jervis, director of Public Health at Hywel Dda University Health Board, said: \"We are really pleased that we have been able to protect our community by providing the first vaccine dose to more than a third of our population, the second highest rate for this figure in Wales.\n\"In recent weeks, the health board's mass vaccination centres have focused on delivering second vaccine doses to care home, health and social care workers in priority groups 1 and 2 using the Pfizer vaccine. Local recorded figures show 57% of care home staff, 70% of health care workers and 56% of social care workers are fully vaccinated.\n\"Our GPs are also working hard to provide our communities with the vaccine. They are currently offering first vaccination to our largest priority group (group 6) of 16-64-year-olds with underlying health conditions and unpaid carers.\"\nShe added that GPs will offer second vaccination doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine within 12 weeks of the first dose. \n\"There is evidence that a gap greater than eight weeks between doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca is a better regime for long term protection for this particular vaccine,\" she said. \nAccording to the figures released on Thursday by Public Health Wales, the percentage of first doses given ranges from 27.7% of the population in Cardiff and Vale to nearly 40% in Powys. \nBetsi Cadwaladr has completed the most full vaccine courses - 43,535 by 7 March and Powys the highest proportion (7.3%). \nHywel Dda has completed a third of its first doses - the second highest in Wales - but the lowest proportion of full vaccines (4.1%).\nWhen it comes to full vaccines for priority groups, Cwm Taf Morgannwg has completed doses for nearly half its care home residents, but this is only 1.6% in the Hywel Dda health board area. \nBoth Aneurin Bevan and Swansea Bay has fully vaccinated around a quarter of 75 to 79-year-olds, but this is 0.5% in Hywel Dda and 1.5% in Cwm Taf Morgannwg. \nCardiff and Vale has fully vaccinated the most people in the 70 to 74 age group, at 15.1%.

      "text": "Going to the hairdresser and meeting friends in a garden are all set to become legal again in Wales.\nThe Welsh Government is relaxing lockdown rules, with stay at home rules replaced by a requirement to stay local.\nUp to four adults from two households will also be allowed to meet up in a private garden in Wales from Saturday.\nNon-essential shops remain closed until 12 April, although garden centres can reopen from 22 March.\nWales' first minister also said self-contained accommodation would be allowed to reopen from 27 March, as long as cases remained low, but people can only go with their own household.\nMark Drakeford warned any further reopening in tourism would be halted if holiday providers took bookings from outside of Wales.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused the first minister of a U-turn over retail, which Mr Drakeford denied, while Plaid Cymru said Welsh ministers had raised false hopes with businesses.\nShielding for clinically extremely vulnerable people will also be paused from 1 April.\nFor people living in England, the \"stay at home\" rule will end on 29 March but holidays within the UK will not be allowed until 12 April at the earliest.\nWales' \"stay at home\" law will switch to \"stay local\" on Saturday and there will be guidance on what that means, according to where you live.\nIt is only likely to last for two weeks, however, ending on 27 March if conditions allow.\n\"The rule of thumb is that you should think of local as a five-mile radius from where you live,\" Mr Drakeford said.\n\"But if you live in a valleys community or a rural area you can exercise your judgement and go a little bit further.\"\nDyfed-Powys Police Federation representative Roger Webb said forces had not been given any information ahead of the announcement on how officers should engage on the new rules and enforce them. \nHe said they would use common sense and work \"in the best way possible\" to make them effective.\nSouth Wales Police urged people to take responsibility for their actions and \"to do the right thing\".\n\"As some restrictions ease, there will be people looking to push the boundaries and break the rules. My plea to them is don't,\" said police and crime commissioner Alun Michael.\nFrom Saturday, 13 March:\nFrom Monday, 15 March:\nFrom Monday, 22 March:\nFrom Saturday 27 March, if case rates remain low:\nThe Welsh Government also wants to reopen all shops and remaining close-contact services from 12 April, if the situation continues to improve.\nMr Drakeford said he was taking a \"careful and cautious\" phased approach to lifting restrictions.\n\"If we do too much too quickly, we will lose control of the virus and set off a new wave of infections,\" he said. \n\"And then we would be back at the beginning again, having to re-impose strict measures to protect people's health and save lives.\"\nVicky Lewis, who owns Vicki's Salon and Kidz Cutz in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, welcomed the news after another lockdown that had been \"horrendous, boring and stressful\".\n\"I have had my salon for 22 years so I've been desperate to work,\" she said.\n\"It is also really worrying as you don't know if you still have your clients. It feels like I'm starting over again.\"\nNow she is looking forward to trying to repair the same \"overgrown and scary haircuts\" she saw after the first lockdown.\nMr Drakeford defended reopening hairdressers before all children were back in school.\nHe said \"schools are our top priority\", and the scientific advice was clear that the safest way to get children back in class was to do so gradually.\nMr Drakeford previously said ministers would look to \"begin to reopen some non-essential retail\" at this review. \nHowever, that will now begin on 22 March when garden centres can reopen and supermarkets remove the wrapping from their non-essential items aisles.\nAll other shops are expected to reopen from 12 April and the Welsh Government says it is making an extra \u00a3150m available to support businesses affected by ongoing restrictions.\nSara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said the delayed reopening of shops was \"deeply frustrating\" with the industry losing \u00a3100m every week in revenue during lockdown.\n\"At the last review the first minister opened the door for a possible reopening on Monday and many retailers have taken the leap and invested in their stores and furloughed staff in preparation,\" she said.\nMs Jones, who is a Conservative councillor in Monmouthshire, added: \"[This delay] will simply exacerbate the woes of a stricken industry.\"\nMr Drakeford told his press conference that he did not \"change\" his mind on the timetable for reopening non-essential retail.\n\"Three weeks ago I said that I hoped today we would be able to begin to reopen non-essential retail and that is exactly what we have been able to do,\" he said.\nHe said he was \"anxious\" about reopening non-essential retail in Wales ahead of the same shops being reopened in England.\nThe first minister said it could act \"as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border.\"\nNon-essential retail in Wales is scheduled to reopen on 12 April, the same date as England.\nHe added it was \"safer\" to lift the ban on shops, including supermarkets, from selling non-essential items ahead of fully reopening shops that have been closed.\nGarden centre bosses had been frustrated by having to close in lockdown while centres in England remained open.\nNicola Pugh, senior operations manager at Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff, said she was \"delighted\" at being given the go-ahead to reopen.\nShe said they had continued to grow plants locally at their nurseries so they were able to stock their centres in Radyr and Wenvoe.\n\"We are ready and waiting and have been working hard to ensure safe shopping for all our wonderful customers,\" Ms Pugh added.\nShielding in Wales for people vulnerable from coronavirus will be paused from 1 April.\nThe Health Minister Vaughan Gething said with cases lower than December \"we must only keep this advice in place for as long as is absolutely necessary\".\n\"In light of the change of context, the Chief Medical Officer has recommended that the advice to the clinically extremely vulnerable to follow shielding measures should be paused after the 31st March,\" Mr Gething wrote.\nHospitality firms and gyms have not yet been given a date to reopen.\nAt his press conference on Friday Mr Drakeford indicated the sectors will be looked at in a future review during April.\nHe said as they look ahead to the end of that month \"if we continue to see an improving public health picture, we will be able to consider what more we can do to support people to meet each other and what we can do to continue reopening our economy, for example, looking at outdoor hospitality, the wedding sector and leisure centres and gyms.\"\nThe first minister accepted he was powerless to prevent people in Wales from travelling abroad if the UK government follows through on its plan to fully reopen foreign travel from 17 May.\nBut he said he was \"asking UK ministers to think very carefully\" about allowing foreign travel as early as that date.\n\"In September we had a really difficult period in Wales because people were coming back from all parts of Europe... bringing infection with them,\" he said in an interview.\n\"I really don't want everything we have done together, the sacrifices we have made, to be put at risk by an importation of the virus.\"\nThe leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, welcomed the change to stay local.\nBut he said: \"Labour's U-turn on the opening of non-essential retail at such short notice will be a hammer blow for many businesses, and the decision to now align with England in that area shows we could've adopted a similar roadmap weeks ago.\n\"The ongoing refusal by Labour ministers to do so will only increase frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there had been \"poor communication\" with non-essential retailers by the Welsh Government that he said had \"certainly raised false hopes amongst many businesses\" that they would open earlier.\nHe told BBC Wales those firms had incurred costs \"getting ready for opening on Monday and now they're not going to be able to do that\".\nPlaid also called for families to be allowed to meet from different households before tourism reopens.\nThree weeks ago Mark Drakeford said that today he would be looking at beginning the process of re-opening non-essential retail.\nSticking to those words, that's exactly what he's done, but there were a lot of non-essential retailers who thought they would get more.\nThere will be real anger that he allowing shops which have stayed open, and that includes the big supermarkets, to start selling non-essential goods before small privately owned shops are allowed to. \nFor a period in December, the case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world - and lockdown was brought in just before Christmas.\nHowever, the rate has fallen significantly during the restrictions and as the vaccination programme is rolled out - it is now at 41 cases per 100,000 people.\nIt remains below the 50 cases per 100,000 \"circuit-breaker\" threshold.\nIn England, all restrictions will be lifted by 21 June at the earliest, as part of a four-stage \"roadmap\" based on certain conditions being met, such as a successful vaccine rollout. \nScotland has announced that more people will be able to meet up outside from Friday, 12 March, which is earlier than expected.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland is still to outline its plans to relax restrictions.\nIf you had the chance to run Wales, what would be the first thing on your list of things to do?

      "text": "Royal Mail is to trial Sunday parcel deliveries for major retailers amid an online shopping boom.\nInternet sales were already on the up before the coronavirus crisis, but the pandemic caused huge growth in 2020.\nRoyal Mail said the trial would open the door to parcel deliveries seven days a week.\nThe postal service has been hit by coronavirus delays, but a spokesperson said it was \"working hard\" to make deliveries.\nRoyal Mail said an increasing number of customers were shopping online and expected to get their purchases as soon as possible after placing their orders.\nIt said that \"a number of retail brands are trialling the service\" but declined to name them as yet.\nRivals such as DPD and Hermes already make Sunday deliveries for major retailers such as Amazon.\nNick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: \"The last year has reset so many customer expectations and the desire for even more convenient and even more frequent parcel deliveries has certainly been one of them.\"\nRoyal Mail said it had \"processed unprecedented parcel volumes\" in the past year as non-essential retailers were closed during lockdowns.\nHowever, its customers were hit with postal delays over Christmas due to \"exceptional\" volumes of post, while delays continued into the New Year as its workforce was affected by Covid-19.\nThe postal service still has advice on its website about delays which says: \"Some areas of the country may experience a reduction in service levels due to higher volumes of mail, the ongoing impact of Covid-related staff absences and necessary social distancing measures at local mail centres and delivery offices.\"\nA Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"Our first priority throughout this pandemic has been the safety of our people and our customers.\n\"We have worked hard to deliver the most comprehensive service we can, including retaining around 10,000 temporary workers to help us deal with the increased demand.\"\nIn addition, Royal Mail is building a second parcel hub in Daventry, which will be larger than its existing hub in Warrington, to meet the growth in demand, it said.\n\"Once complete, the new hub will be the size of more than 10 football pitches and have the capacity to process over one million parcels per day, making it the largest Royal Mail parcel hub in the UK,\" the firm said in a statement.\nRoyal Mail piloted Sunday parcel deliveries in 2014, but took the decision not to roll out that service.\nThe Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"We were early adopters with the 2014 Sunday trial, which was limited to within the M25 area.\n\"Since that time, there has been a seismic change in consumers' online behaviours.\"\nThe spokesperson said that customers were making more online purchases than ever before and expected deliveries seven days a week.\n\"This trial is responding to those changing demands for even higher levels of convenience across the UK,\" the spokesperson added.\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"With the e-commerce boom continuing through the latest lockdown, online shoppers have come to expect seven-days-a-week delivery as standard.\n\"Launching a Sunday delivery service is clearly an attempt to seize the moment and capitalise on the snowballing momentum the group has picked up over the past four months.\n\"This week, Royal Mail again upgraded its profits forecasts because of the surge in home deliveries and renaissance of letter writing during the pandemic.\"\nHowever, Ms Streeter said that whether it would be a success or not \"is far from signed, sealed and delivered\", adding that there had \"long been under-investment in automation\" in the service.\n\"Royal Mail needs to show it has the capacity to meet this unprecedented demand.\"\nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \"This expansion into Sunday parcel deliveries will certainly be a challenge for Royal Mail which has struggled with the increase in demand during the pandemic, and has been outshone by some of its competitors.\nHowever, she said that Royal Mail remained one of the largest couriers in the UK, and the introduction of two parcel hubs in the UK \"shows its commitment to modernising\".\n\"Now the long-running dispute over pay and conditions with the union is over, it can focus on investing in its parcels division.\"\n\"Although the move may be out of necessity rather than the business being fully prepared, consumer shopping habits have now shifted. Royal Mail needs to stamp its authority and deliver on its commitment or face being bottom of the pile.\""

      "text": "More than 3,000 UK email servers remain at risk from the global Microsoft Exchange email flaw, officials believe.\nThe National Cyber Security Centre said it estimated 7,000 servers had been affected by the flaw in the UK and only half had been secured.\nIt said malicious software had been detected on 2,300 machines but it had helped businesses remove it.\nThe agency said it was \"vital\" that all affected businesses took action to secure their email servers.\nThe announcement reveals the scale of the problem among UK companies for the first time since the global security flaw emerged last week.\nRansomware groups have begun using the flaw to install their malicious programs, the NCSC warned - though there was no evidence of widespread ransomware attacks on UK companies so far.\nOnce installed, ransomware locks away a user's data behind strong encryption, making the computer system unusable. The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data.\nThe security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system, which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide.\nThe NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue.\nInitially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data.\nBut after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw.\nThe result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack.\n\"We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,\" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned.\n\"While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates.\"\nHe also urged all organisations to \"familiarise\" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised.\nThe true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone.\nWhat is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact.\nWhile many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low. \nThat may change in the coming days as more reports come in. \nWhat is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come."

      "text": "The Duke of Cambridge has said the royals are \"very much not a racist family\" in his first comments after accusations by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a TV interview.\nPrince William also said he had not yet spoken to his brother but would do so.\nMeghan and Prince Harry said a royal had expressed concern over \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\nBuckingham Palace previously said the claim was \"concerning\" but it would be addressed privately.\nIn a statement, the Palace said \"recollections may vary\" but that the Sussexes would \"always be much loved family members\".\nDuring a visit to a school in Stratford, east London, on Thursday, Prince William was asked by a reporter: \"Is the Royal Family a racist family, sir?\"\nThe duke replied: \"We're very much not a racist family.\"\nAsked whether he had spoken to Prince Harry since the Oprah interview, Prince William said: \"No, I haven't spoken to him yet but I will do.\"\nPrince William's visit is not the first appearance by a senior royal since the interview aired - the Prince of Wales carried out an engagement earlier this week. \nDespite Prince William's team making clear to reporters he wouldn't be answering questions, he must have known they might come. One wonders if he had planned to engage or whether the answers were impromptu. \nWilliam will be well aware that anything he utters will be headline news.\nThe first question alluded to the rift between the two brothers. In the Oprah interview, Prince Harry said their relationship  is \"space\" at the moment but that \"time heals all things hopefully\". \nWe don't know when they last spoke but we do now know that William does intend to speak to him.\nAs for the second and more direct question - \"Is the royal family a racist family, sir?\" - William could have ignored it. But, despite the Queen's statement saying the race issue would be dealt with privately, the prince clearly felt he had to push back on what has become a very public and damaging allegation. \nRemaining silent, he felt, was not the best option.\nIn the TV interview, Meghan told Oprah there were \"concerns and conversations about how dark [Archie's] skin might be when he was born\".\nBoth Prince Harry and Meghan refused to say who made the comment - but Harry later clarified to Oprah that it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\nDuring the interview Harry also said it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the \"colonial undertones\" of news headlines and articles.\nAnd asked by Oprah if the couple left the UK because of racism from the tabloid media, Harry replied: \"It was a large part of it.\"\nIn the interview, Harry also spoke about his relationship with his family - especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother Prince William.\nAt one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles \"stopped taking my calls\".\nAnd of William, Harry said: \"The relationship is 'space' at the moment. And time heals all things, hopefully.\"\nBuckingham Palace issued a response to the interview earlier this week following crisis meetings involving senior royals.\nFigures from US TV network CBS suggest that nearly 50 million people around the world have watched Oprah's interview with the couple.\nThe fallout from the interview has also seen broadcaster Piers Morgan leave his role as host of Good Morning Britain, after his comments about Meghan attracted 41,000 complaints.\nMeanwhile, the head of the Society of Editors - an industry body for the UK press - resigned after a row over its reaction to Harry's comments about the tabloid media."

      "title": "Covid: Four more cases of Brazil variant found in England",
      "tags": "Bradford,Brazil,South Gloucestershire Council,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Four further cases of the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil have been identified in England, bringing the total in the UK to 10.\nThree cases of the P.1 variant are in South Gloucestershire and are said to be close or household contacts of the two existing cases in the area.\nThe other new case was identified in Bradford.\nScientists previously said the variant appears more contagious and there were concerns over its response to vaccines.\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said last week it was hoped that vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\nThe new Bradford case tested positive for Covid-19 in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February. \nSubsequent genomic sequencing identified the case as the P.1 variant, Public Health England said in a statement. \nThousands of positive Covid cases, from all across the UK, are sent for this further sequencing every week as scientists aim to identify any variants of the virus. \nThe new South Gloucestershire cases were uncovered when people were offered testing in response to the initial cases found in the area last month - and those who tested positive had their results sent on for further analysis.\nSpecialist contact tracing teams are working to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified.\nContact-tracers have advised close contacts of the individual in Bradford to isolate and get a test.\nThere are now seven cases of the P.1 variant in England and three in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil.\nIt was always known more cases of the P.1 Brazil variant were coming.\nWhen it was confirmed 11 days ago the variant was here, it was known two household members of the original South Gloucestershire cases had tested positive for Covid.\nThe results of the genomic sequencing to check which variant they had was not yet complete, but the expectation was it would be P.1.\nWhere does this leave us? A quarter of all Covid cases are being checked for variants and all the indications are that they are not spreading.\nThe new P.1 cases brings the total to 10, while there have been just over 300 cases of the South African variant and another 113 cases where the UK virus has acquired the E484 mutation which allows it to escape some of the immune response.\nThere will be more variants out there that have not been detected, but given that overall week-on-week Covid infection levels are lower we can be confident the variant is not taking hold.\nMonitoring this though is crucial to help the UK decide if vaccines updates are needed ahead of next winter.\nSeparately, Public Health England said a new variant identified in the UK was designated a \"variant under investigation\" on 4 March. It is not known where this variant first emerged.*\nIt said the variant - known as VUI-202103/01 - contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with so-called \"variants of concern\". \nBut it added that \"it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a [variant of concern]\".\nNo additional cases have yet been found.\nIn other developments, rough sleepers and other homeless people in England will be prioritised to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nIt comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people who are homeless or sleeping rough were likely to have underlying health conditions and should be offered jabs alongside those in priority group six - people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.\nThey should also be offered the vaccine without the need for an NHS number or GP registration, the JCVI added.\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in the UK has risen compared with recent days, after a further 6,753 cases were reported, according to the latest data.\nAnother 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded.\nAs of 10 March, some 23,053,716 people had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 1,351,515 had received a second dose.\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released in February. Three cases were initially found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. \nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - prompted intensive tracing efforts in the region as the identity of the person was initially unknown as he or she failed to register their test properly. \nBut that person was found at the end of last week and it was confirmed that he or she had  \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission.\nUnder current Covid restrictions, holiday travel is not allowed in the UK or abroad. Anyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education or work, and journeys within England are only allowed for limited reasons.\nThere are also travel bans on 33 countries \"where the risk of a new variant is greatest\", including Brazil and other South American nations. \nHowever, the ban on travellers from South America came into effect on 15 February, after one case of the Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. The latest Bradford case is also a person known to have travelled from Brazil via Paris just before that change came in.\n*This story has now been updated to reflect new information on UK variants on the Public Health England website. PHE previously reported two cases of the VUI-202103/01 variant had been found in the south-east of England in individuals who had recently been in Antigua. PHE now says: \"Despite the travel history of these cases there is no scientific evidence to determine where this variant first emerged.\""

      "tags": "US politics,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has said he is hopeful that America can \"mark independence\" from Covid-19 on 4 July if people get vaccinated.\nIn his first primetime address as president, Mr Biden said he would order states to make all adults eligible for vaccinations by 1 May.\nCurrent measures prioritise people by age or health condition. \nMr Biden was speaking exactly a year to the day after the outbreak was classified a global pandemic. \nSchools have been closed, businesses shuttered and people kept apart.\nLast year many Americans were forced to forgo the elaborate parades, fireworks displays and parties that  feature in the national holiday on 4 July, which marks independence from Britain. \nIn his speech, President Biden said he did not expect large events to be able to go ahead, but he hoped small groups could meet again.\n\"If we do this together, by 4 July, there is a good chance you, your family and friends can get together in your backyard or in your neighbourhood and have a cookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day,\" he said.\n\"After a long, hard year, that will make this Independence Day truly special - where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.\"\nThe US has by far the highest death toll in the world from the virus, but death and infection rates have been declining in recent weeks as the vaccine programme picks up.\nThe country's health system is complex and individual states are in charge of public health policy. While the federal government is responsible for getting the vaccine distributed to the states, it has largely relied on them to handle the distribution.\nBut as part of the plans to expand vaccinations, President Biden said the number of places where people could be immunised would be increased, with veterinarians and dentists among those also allowed to vaccinate people.\nMobile units will travel into local communities to provide vaccinations in underserved communities, he said.\nMr Biden previously set a target of 100 million vaccinations by his 100th day in office. But in his address on Thursday, he said this target would be reached on day 60, which is 20 March. \nHe was speaking shortly after signing a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) economic relief bill, which marks an early legislative victory for his administration. It includes a $1,400 direct payment to most Americans, along with other measures to help people out of poverty and provide additional funding to local and state governments.\nDespite the good news on vaccinations, Mr Biden warned that the \"fight is far from over\".\nHe called on people to maintain social distancing measures, hand washing and wear a mask.\n\"Beating the virus and getting back to normal relies on national unity,\" he said.\nMr Biden said last month he hoped that life would return to \"normal\" by Christmas 2021. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, described this timetable as \"reasonable\".\nThe president's caution is at odds with some states such as Texas and Mississippi, which are relaxing restrictions in order to boost their economies.\nOne year ago, the United States joined the world in facing a brutal truth. The coronavirus pandemic was going to fundamentally alter everyday life. Businesses shuttered. Citizens sheltered in their home. Life ground to a halt.\nOn Thursday night, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation, President Joe Biden said there was light at the end of the tunnel.\nThe big news from his speech was that all adult Americans would be eligible for a vaccine by the beginning of May - a pace, he boasted, that was the best in the world.\nHis most important message, however, may have been his urging that all Americans should get the jab when it's their turn. \"I know they're safe,\" he said.\nA recent opinion poll showed that nearly half of Republicans are sceptical of the vaccine. If their doubt becomes inaction, Mr Biden's promises - widespread school openings, an ability to travel and Independence Day celebrations - will go unrealised.\nHis speech was part promise, part warning. Get vaccinated, continue social distancing, wear masks - or else.\n\"America is coming back,\" he said. But, he added, Americans needed to do their part.\nThis time last year, there were 1,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US and about 30 people had died.\nAll US major sport was cancelled and then-President Donald Trump suspended travel from Europe, saying he hoped the US would be open again for Easter 2020. This prediction was repeatedly revised.\nThe pandemic has now left more than 530,000 people dead in the US and has infected more than 29 million.\nIn his speech, President Biden criticised the Trump administration by saying the virus was initially met with \"denials for days, weeks, then months, that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, more loneliness\".\nHe also denounced \"vicious hate crimes\" against Asian Americans, who he said had been \"attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated\" for the pandemic. Mr Trump repeatedly referred to coronavirus as the \"China virus\".\nCorrection 29 March 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the US Covid-19 death toll as more than the death toll from World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined. In fact the number of US deaths in all three wars exceeds half a million and so this line has been removed from the story."

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder,Women,Birmingham,Jess Phillips",
      "text": "Labour's shadow domestic violence minister, Jess Phillips, has said society has \"just accepted\" dead women as \"one of those things\". \nShe read out the names of 118 women and girls killed in the UK this year, where a man has been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator, in an International Women's Day debate. \nMs Phillips said there was currently no government research into the data. \nMinisters say they have prioritised support for victims during lockdown. \nSince being elected in 2015, Ms Phillips has marked the annual International Women's Day debate by remembering the individuals whose lives were taken in the past twelve months. \nReading lists out in the chamber is normally prohibited, but Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing said she was suspending a three-minute time limit on speeches to enable this tradition to go ahead. \nThe debate was dominated by tributes to 33-year-old Sarah Everard, who disappeared in south London on 3 March. \nA Metropolitan police officer is being questioned on suspicion of murder and kidnap after human remains were found in the search for Ms Everard.\nMPs said her death shone a spotlight once more on the scale of the violence against women. \nSpeaking in the Commons chamber, Ms Phillips said: \"In this place we count what we care about.\n\"We count the vaccines done, the number of people on benefits, we rule or oppose based on a count and we obsessively track that data. We love to count data of our own popularity. However, we don't currently count dead women.\"\nShe said there was no government study done into data on victims of domestic abuse who are killed, die by suicide or die suddenly.\n\"Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,\" she added.\n\"Dead women is just one of those things. Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common.\"\nListening to Ms Phillips read out the list of victims, the Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, said it was \"impossible not to be overcome as those names echo round the chamber\". \nShe said: \"Every year we bring tissues, we prepare ourselves mentally as well as we can\" to list to the \"horrific list\" but pandemic or not, she said, \"women are tired having to pre-empt possible violence and risk assess every action\".\nSNP deputy leader at Westminster Kirsten Oswald told how she feels walking alone in the dark:  \"I will not change my behaviour, but do feel scared sometimes\", she said.\n\"I cross the road, I have my keys in my hand, I think about where the street lights are, where the dark alleys are.\" \n\"I'm aware and vigilant, because, like all women, I have to be.\"\nThe Conservative MP, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said things would only change when there were greater societal changes and \"more women in the room\" in positions of authority. \n\"Despite everything that's been achieved for women's rights,\" he said the debate proved \"this is not a job that has been done, it is still very much a job to do\". \nAs vigils highlighting women's safety are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard, more than 200 women have signed an open letter to the government calling for a \"firm commitment\" to tackle male violence.\nThe letter, which has been signed by Labour MP Harriet Harman, charity workers and campaigners, says \"women are still at risk doing the most simple of things\". \n\"Something has to change - and it cannot be women, the victims in this, to be responsible for leading that charge.\"\nDomestic abuse charities have warned that calls to their helplines have \"gone through the roof\" since the lockdown began.\nMore than 40,000 calls and contacts were made to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline in the first three months of the lockdown in 2020. \nUnder the government's Domestic Abuse Bill, councils in England will get an extra \u00a36m to provide support and safe accommodation for abuse survivors and their families.\nThe additional money comes on top of a \u00a310m emergency fund given to councils to help domestic abuse survivors during the pandemic.

So far, no Senate Republicans - who hold 50 of the 100 seats - have said they will vote for the bill.\nAmazon removed the book When Harry Became Sally, by Ryan Anderson and published in 2018, from its online stores, e-book and audio book platforms last month.\nThe book sets out to answer \"questions arising from our transgender moment\", its publisher, Encounter Books, says on its website. \nIt adds that through the book Mr Anderson \"exposes the contrast between the media's sunny depiction of gender fluidity and the often sad reality of living with gender dysphoria\".\nShortly after When Harry Became Sally was removed from Amazon on 21 February, Republican senators Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Mike Braun and Mike Lee sent a letter to the retailer requesting an explanation for its decision. \nAmong other questions, they asked: \"Is this action part of a broader campaign against conservative material and voices on Amazon's platforms?\" \nOn Thursday, Amazon replied in a letter to the senators that said \"all retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer\". \n\"We offer customers across the political spectrum a wide variety of content that includes disparate opinions,\" it said.\n\"We carefully consider the content we make available in our stores, and we review our approach regularly... we have chosen not to sell books that frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness.\"\nAmazon said it had notified the book's distributor in advance that it was removing the publication \"for violating our content guidelines\". \nOn Friday, Mr Anderson and Encounter Books criticised the decision in a joint statement, saying that \"no good comes from shutting down a debate about important matters\".\n\"Everyone agrees that gender dysphoria is a serious condition that causes great suffering,\" the statement adds. \n\"There is a debate, however... about how best to treat patients who experience gender dysphoria.\""

      "title": "Covid stimulus: Biden signs $1.9tn relief bill into law",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has signed a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) economic relief bill that aims to help Americans impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic into law.\nThe bill includes $1,400 payments, an extension of jobless benefits, and a child tax credit that is expect to lift millions out of poverty. \nMr Biden said the relief package will rebuild \"the backbone of this country\".\nThe spending bill, one of the largest in US history, passed Congress without a single Republican supporter. \nMr Biden is due to give a primetime address later on Thursday to tout the bill's provisions. He and other Democrats will also hold a signing ceremony at the White House on Friday.\nThis sixth Covid-19 relief bill is a major legislative win for Mr Biden.\nThe package has been broadly popular among Americans.\nA March Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of US adults surveyed expressed support for the bill, including 41% of Republicans.\nUnemployment skyrocketed over the last year, with a current rate of 6.2%, according to the US Labor Department.\nMr Biden had originally planned the bill signing for Friday, but it was pushed up in his schedule \"because Congress enroled the bill more quickly than we anticipated,\" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a tweet.\nJoe Biden was originally expected to sign the ambitiously named \"American Recovery Plan Act\" at the White House on Friday. Instead the final step in enacting the president's first significant piece of legislation was moved up to Thursday afternoon.\nAn official ceremony is still planned for Friday, but the scheduling change reveals an administration anxious to get busy selling the American people on the benefits of this massive and multifaceted piece of government spending.\nThis - and Biden's address to the nation Thursday night - are the opening gun of a two-week public-relations blitz, including presidential travel, to highlight the legislation. It shouldn't be too hard a sell, as opinion polls indicate widespread support for the law even among Republican voters.\nWhat Biden and the Democrats don't want is a repeat of the 2009 Great Recession relief bill passed under President Barack Obama. Many in the party believe that Democrats did not claim enough credit for the law's benefits - and that voters had forgotten about their efforts when they cast their ballots in the 2010 congressional mid-term elections (and roundly voted Democrats out of office).\nBiden, as vice-president, had a front-row seat for that debacle. His actions as president suggest he hasn't forgotten it.\nThe act includes one-off direct payments worth $1,400 to be sent off to most Americans.\nIt extends weekly jobless benefit payments of $300 until September.\nIt also allocates $350bn to state and local governments, some $130bn to school reopening, $49bn for expanded Covid-19 testing and research, as well as $14bn for vaccine distribution.\nA proposal to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour became a sticking point in the Senate and did not make it into the final version of the bill.\nWhite House officials say that direct payments, the third payments of the pandemic, will begin before the end of March.\nPrevious cheques were sent out by tax officials within one to two weeks of the bills' passage.\nIndividuals earning up to $75,000 will receive a $1,400 payment.\nTax officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) use tax statements to determine the exact size of each person's payment. For that reason they have urged Americans to quickly file their tax returns, which are due 15 April.\nStimulus cheques sent out by Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, included the former president's personal signature.\nBut Mrs Psaki said Mr Biden's signature will not be on these payments.\nCurrently, American couples are able to apply for a $2,000 per child under the Child Tax Credit, a 24-year old government programme. \nThis law increases the tax break to $3,000 for every child age 6 to 17. Children under the age of 6 will receive a $3,600 benefit.\nMore than 4 million children - more than half of the total - could be lifted out of poverty, according to analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \nIt also extends access to lower income families, even those that pay nothing in taxes, by making the credit refundable.\nThe programme is temporary, and will expire after one year.\nBefore signing the bill in the White House Oval Office, Mr Biden said the bill is about \"rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this nation, working people, middle class folks, the people that built the country a fighting chance. \n\"That's what the essence of it is.\"\nHe promised that he would have \"a lot more to say about that tonight and the next couple of days\".\nMr Biden will deliver his first primetime address to the American public on Thursday night.\nThe speech comes on the 50th day of his presidency.\nIt will be the third time this year that he has marked a moment in the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 529,000 people dead and over 29 million infected.\nPreviewing his remarks on Wednesday, Mr Biden said he would be laying out \"the next phase,\" of the US Covid-response.\n\"There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year. But we cannot let our guard down now or assume the victory is inevitable,\" he said.\n\"Together, we're going get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future.\"\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that Mr Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris will travel to Atlanta, Georgia next Friday as part of the \"Help is Here tour to amplify the American Rescue Plan\".

      "text": "The captain of a trawler which swamped a small boat, causing it to sink and three men to drown, has been jailed.\nMircea \"Mitch\" Ilie, 40, Irinel Popovici, 41, and Treaiam Dumitrache, 50, died on an overnight fishing trip on the James 2 in August 2017.\nWater engulfed their boat when it was passed by a vessel skippered by David Marr, off Shoreham, West Sussex.\nMarr, from Aberdeenshire, was jailed for 12 months after being convicted of not keeping a proper lookout.\nThe 55-year-old, from Peterhead, was sentenced following a trial at Lewes Crown Court, which was sitting at Brighton Magistrates' Court.\nSole survivor Elvis Cojocariu was found alive by a fisherman after the sinking, suffering from hypothermia.\nThe four Romanian friends had been on board the James 2, when Marr's trawler, called the Vertrouwen, \"passed extremely close to it\", the jury was told.\nThe Vertrouwen, a scallop trawler, left the port of Shoreham at 00:07 BST on 6 August 2017, with four crew on board. \nMarr, who had 35 years of experience, took the first watch.\nAt 00:24 he sent a WhatsApp message to a friend, and a minute later, unknown to Marr, the trawler passed the James 2, swamping it and causing it to sink. \nMr Cojocariu told the court the crew had seen the Vertrouwen from about 1km (0.6 miles) away, and all four had been signalling \"like mad\" as it approached, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. \nHowever the trawler carried on in the same direction and at the same speed and the boat was swamped by waves, a CPS spokeswoman said. \nMr Cojocariu described having a \"clear view of the Vertrouwen's deck as she passed by and that he couldn't see anyone there,\" she said. \nMarr claimed he had not seen the smaller vessel's navigation or cabin lights, or the head torches of the men on board.\nThe jury was told Marr had been unaware that the boat had sunk until a crew member told him \"there was an incident off Shoreham the night before\". \nLibby Clark, from the CPS, said: \"Instead of constantly checking to ensure he knew what was out there, it appears [Marr] was doing other things and, even after his actions caused the James 2 to sink, he continued to sail on, oblivious to the fact that three men were about to die as a result of his not keeping a proper look out.\n\"The evidence showed that he would have been able to see the lights on the boat for six minutes before the near-miss, yet he continued to sail directly towards the boat with tragic consequences.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "Welsh retailors had a \"disastrous end of year\" because of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has said.\nFootfall was down 52.3% in December compared to the previous year, more than the UK average decline of 46.1%.\nThe Welsh Retail Consortium said businesses had been dealt a \"hammer blow\" with the pre-Christmas lockdown.\nDebbie Corkish, who runs Wizarding Boutique in Llandudno, Conwy, said \"it will take years\" for her business to recover from lockdowns.\nWales went into a national lockdown on 20 December, following a surge in coronavirus cases, requiring all non-essential shops to close.\nWales saw the most pronounced year-on-year shopping centre footfall decline of all UK regions, at -59.1%, while footfall in Cardiff decreased by 54% compared to December 2019, according to BRC-ShopperTrak data.\nSara Jones, head of Welsh Retail Consortium, said: \"It was a disastrous end to the year for Welsh shops, with the nation experiencing the UK's greatest fall in shopper footfall. \n\"Any hopes of a golden quarter for Welsh retail were dealt a hammer blow by the early pre-Christmas lockdown, forcing Welsh shops to shut during what should have been their busiest period. \n\"With the nation now in full lockdown, and so called non-essential shops remaining shuttered, it is time for decision makers to re-group, to re-assess and to identify ways to revitalise the Welsh retail industry given the key role we can play in the economic recovery of the nation.\"\nWizarding Boutique owner Ms Corkish said the financial compensation from the Welsh Government of \u00a33,000 will not cover her losses for the Christmas week alone.\n\"After the English lockdown ended in December, we took a third of what we had the previous Saturday.\n\"It's like people forgot that they wanted to shop locally after summer [and] went into Manchester and Liverpool for their Christmas shopping.\n\"The week before Christmas should have been our busiest day but then lockdown was announced. \n\"It will take years to recover from last year. Being a tourist town, without tourists businesses just can survive. I dread to know what Llandudno is going to look like when all of this is over.\""

      "text": "A public inquiry has been announced into plans for the first new deep coal mine in the UK for decades.\nThe government had previously decided not to intervene in the project near Whitehaven in Cumbria, which was in the hands of local officials.\nBut ministers have taken control because of \"increased\" controversy.\nGreen campaigners say the mine will increase carbon emissions and send the wrong signal in the run-up to a UK-hosted climate conference in October.\nThe Woodhouse Colliery would extract coking coal for the steel industry from the seabed off St Bees, with a processing plant at Kells, in Whitehaven.\nCumbria County Council councillors, who have been assessing the project since 2017, gave it the go-ahead last March - but have since decided to review the application.\nLast month it was reported that the government's climate tsar, Alok Sharma, was apoplectic the plans for the coal mine had not been stopped.\nMr Sharma, who is in charge of preparations for the COP26 UN climate conference, has faced calls to resign over the issue.\nHe told MPs only last month that the mine was a \"local issue\" and would be decided by the council. \nBut the government has now decided to \"call in\" the application, meaning Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick will get the final say over it.\nIn a letter to Cumbria County Council, Mr Jenrick said the application had raised issues of \"more than local importance\".\nHe added the reversal had also been prompted by new advice on carbon emissions from government climate advisers published in December. \nHowever, a public inquiry will first be held by independent planners at the Planning Inspectorate. The inquiry process could take a number of months. \nAsked on Friday whether the government backed the mine or not, Boris Johnson said he couldn't get involved as it was now a \"qausi-judicial planning decision\".\nMP Trudy Harrison, whose Copeland constituency would include the mine, is a ministerial aide to the prime minister and has described opponents of the mine as being in \"cloud cuckoo land\".\nMs Harrison has yet to comment on the decision to hold an inquiry, but the Tory MP for nearby Workington, Mark Jenkinson, called the decision a \"capitulation to climate alarmists\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Cumbria, he said the \"screeching U-turn\" could open a \"Pandora's box\" over how the UK's contribution to climate change is measured.\nHe added there was \"nothing on the horizon\" to replace coking coal in the process for making steel, a sector that is due to play an important role in the UK's \"green recovery\".\nThe government could still decide to approve the mine, but given the amount of anger it's caused that seems unlikely - at least until after the UN climate conference. \nLocal Conservatives strongly supported the scheme and the employment it would bring. \nBut the government's climate advisers, along with a crowd of green groups, warned it would increase carbon emissions when the UK's committed to cutting them.\nWhat's more, it would harm Britain's international reputation before the UN conference, they said.\nOne of the world's leading climate scientists, the American James Hansen, warned Boris Johnson risked humiliation over the mine. \nThe US climate envoy John Kerry warned against it on Monday. And yesterday Alok Sharma was again rebuked by MPs over the plan.\nIt was too much pressure. \nProf Rebecca Willis and Prof Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University say the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than a million households.\nSupporters of the mine say that by producing coal to be used in Europe, the mine will reduce emissions from shipping coal from Australia or the USA.\nBut the mine proposal comes at a time when the government wants every sector of the UK economy to reduce CO2 emissions - not find new sources of carbon.  \nLabour's shadow environment secretary Ed Miliband said the government should \"block\" the mine and \"provide alternative jobs in the green industries of the future\".\n\"We owe people a long-term secure employment situation, the mine isn't the answer,\" he told reporters. \nHe added that whilst there was a \"current need\" for coking coal in steelmaking, \"all experts say over time the industry's going to need to move towards hydrogen as the answer\".\nLib Dem Tim Farron, MP for nearby Westmoreland and Lonsdale, said: \"In the year that Britain hosts COP26, it is blindingly obviously that we won't be taken seriously on the world stage with this coal mine hanging round our neck.\"\nHe added: \"I hope this public inquiry leads to these plans finally being axed, and the government instead looks at bringing well-paid, long-term, green jobs to Cumbria.\""
