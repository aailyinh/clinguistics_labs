      "tags": "Volcanoes,Iceland",
      "text": "A volcano which erupted on Friday night near Iceland's capital Reykjavik seems to be subsiding, scientists say.\nLava at Fagradalsfjall burst through a crack in the Earth's crust hundreds of metres long and a series of small fountains turned the night sky red.\nIcelanders had been bracing themselves for an eruption for several weeks, after the island nation recorded more than 50,000 recent earthquakes.\nMeteorologists said the eruption was small and no-one was in danger.\nThe last eruption there was some 800 years ago.\nIn 2010, the eruption of another volcano, Eyjafjallajokull, brought air traffic to a halt across Europe.\nHowever, the eruption of Fagradalsfjall has not spewed out much ash, so no major disruption is expected.\nThe biggest threat was pollution from the gases that had been released, and nearby residents were asked to keep their windows shut.\nBut the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) said in a report on Saturday that the pollution was likely to have little effect on the health and well-being of the area's inhabitants.\nOfficials quoted by AFP news agency said that the area of the eruption was open to the public, but could only be accessed by a difficult hike of several hours from the nearest road.\nThere is also a potential danger from sulphur dioxide gas.\n\"Currently gas pollution is not expected to cause much discomfort for people except close up to the source of the eruption. The gas emissions will be monitored closely,\" the IMO said. \nThe IMO said the eruption of Fagradalsfjall began at about 20:45 GMT on Friday, and was later confirmed via webcams and satellite images.\nA coastguard helicopter was sent to survey the area, about 30km (19 miles) from Reykjavik. \nIt then sent first images of the lava snaking its way down after the eruption.\n\"I can see the glowing red sky from my window,\" said Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, who lives in Grindavik, 8 km (5 miles) from the eruption.\nA magnitude 3.1 earthquake was recorded 1.2 km from Fagradalsfjall just several hours earlier.\nIceland frequently experiences tremors as it straddles two tectonic plates, which are drifting in opposite directions."

      "text": "A teacher and ex-Royal Marine said his family is lucky to be alive after a suspected arson attack which destroyed their home in County Durham.\nSean Ivey, from Wingate, fled to safety with his wife and two children after a fire broke out early on Thursday. \nMr Ivey, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, believed he was targeted after standing up to anti-social behaviour.\nTwo men have been arrested and Durham Police issued a 48-hour dispersal order in the area.\n\"I just woke up in bed and felt the need to look out of the window,\" Mr Ivey said.\n\"I shouted to my wife that the car was on fire, go and get the kids.\"\nIt broke out around 01:45 GMT. Flames from the car then spread to a caravan parked on the driveway, before spreading to the roof of the bungalow.\nA second fire broke out during the early hours of Friday. Nobody was inside at the time.\nDurham Police are treating them as suspected arson.\nMr Ivey, who served with 45 Commando, said young people had been spotted riding around the area on quad bikes wearing balaclavas, \"terrorising\" other road users.\n\"[There have been] burglaries, car fires, this is quite extreme but these aren't isolated incidents,\" he added.\n\"I'm just absolutely fed up of the anti-social behaviour, the lack of respect, the lack of discipline, and where does it stop?\"\nOn Wednesday, hours before the first fire, Mr Ivey posted on social media that his parents had been robbed when four men burst into their home.\nHe said he had a run-in last weekend with a young biker \"riding like a lunatic\" and saw another in the main street of the former mining village pulling wheelies and mounting the paths.\nHe also called out gangs gathering outside a local takeaway.\nA fundraising campaign has raised more than \u00a350,000 to help the family, whose home was not insured because a policy had run out.\nPhotographs, medals and Mr Ivey's Royal Marines uniform have also been lost.\nTwo men, aged 22 and 25, have been arrested. Police said they were continuing to carry out lines of inquiry in relation to the second fire.\nInsp Emma Kay said it had had \"a huge impact\" on the family and the wider community. \n\"I would encourage anyone with information no matter how small it may be to come forward and help us bring the offenders to justice,\" she said.\nPatrols are being increased and the dispersal order will be in place over the weekend, meaning anyone failing to leave when asked will face arrest.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The European Union should not \"build walls\" around the distribution of vaccines and should seek to meet its contractual \"obligations\", Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has told the BBC.\nHis comments follow a threat by the European Commission to block vaccine exports to countries including the UK.\nEU Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said all sides needed to \"calm down\".\nOn Saturday, a record 873,784 combined first and second doses of Covid vaccines were given in the UK.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he wanted to thank \"everyone involved\" in the rollout.\nDespite the vaccine progress, Mr Wallace did not rule out extending a ban on overseas holidays amid rising cases in other countries.\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said last week that if Covid vaccine supplies in Europe do not improve, the bloc \"will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate\".\nMr Wallace told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that both the EU and the UK should live up to their contractual \"obligations\".\nThe defence secretary said: \"The European Union stands for the rule of law... and that means we should all abide by our contracts. We are legally all obliged, both the buyer and the purchaser.\n\"The European Commission also recognises that the world is watching.\"\nMr Wallace said the language being used by the European Commission was \"counterproductive\", adding: \"Trying to... build walls around this would only damage both EU citizens and United Kingdom.\"\nEarlier this month, European Council President Charles Michel said the UK had imposed an \"outright ban\" on the export of vaccines and their components.\nHowever, there is no ban and his claim was dismissed by the British government as \"completely false\".\nMrs von der Leyen said the EU is still waiting for exports from the UK, and it wants reciprocity.\nMs McGuinness told Andrew Marr: \"I think all of us should put our hands up and say we were not prepared for this global pandemic. We did not do our best at the beginning but we are doing our best now to protect our citizens.\n\"I think we all need to, if you like, calm down, look very... dispassionately at the situation around the raw materials for vaccines, around where they are produced and how we might ramp up that production.\"\nAlso on Marr, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said it was \"right to calm down\" tensions over the issue.\n\"We do better when we work together - if we don't defeat the virus everywhere we are not going to defeat it anywhere. And there are new strains of the virus that are currently emerging.\n\"We may not be out of the woods with Covid yet and so we have to work together... cool the rhetoric,\" Ms Nandy said.\nSome 41 million vaccine doses have been exported from the EU to 33 countries in six weeks, Mrs von der Leyen said, including more than 10 million which have gone to the UK.\nFollowing comments by government adviser Dr Mike Tildesley that summer holidays overseas are \"extremely unlikely\", Mr Wallace refused to rule out an extension to the foreign holiday ban.\n\"I think we will play it by ear. I'm not going to rule anything in or anything out,\" he said.\nMr Wallace added that it would be \"premature\" to book a trip abroad while we are \"seeing growing variants\".\nMeanwhile, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said that restrictions could last for \"quite a long period of time\".\nShe told Marr: \"We may eventually get back to a much more normal situation.\n\"But people have got used to those lower-level restrictions now, and people can live with them, and the economy can still go on with those less severe restrictions in place.\n\"So I think certainly for a few years, at least until other parts of the world are as well vaccinated as we are, and the numbers have come down everywhere that is when we may be able to go very gradually back to a more normal situation.\""

      "tags": "Mumbai,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Indian city of Mumbai is to roll out mandatory coronavirus tests in crowded places as the country grapples with a rise in infections.\nThe local government said rapid tests would be done randomly in areas such as shopping centres and train stations.\nA refusal to be tested will \"amount to an offence\", it said.\nIndia recorded 40,953 new Covid cases on Saturday, the biggest daily jump for nearly four months. A total 159,000 people have died with the disease.\nIt has seen more than 11.5 million cases of coronavirus infections so far - and the number has been steadily climbing for weeks as the country scrambles to vaccinate its population and identify highly contagious variants of the disease.\nIn Mumbai, a coronavirus hotspot in the western state of Maharashtra, 2,982 people have contracted the disease in the past 24 hours.\nThe rapid tests will be mandatory in crowded places such as shopping centres and train stations from 22 March, city officials said.\nThe commissioner of the local authority told India Today that people should \"be ready for the swab test\" whenever they enter a busy area in Mumbai. \nThe tests will be carried out for free - except those at shopping centres, where the costs will be covered by individuals. \nMumbai officials did not specify what action would be taken against those who refuse to have tests.\nThe local authority said it would use rapid antigen tests (RATs), a type of test that detects the presence of proteins unique to the coronavirus.\nBut research shows these tests are less reliable than other types and sometimes produce incorrect results.\nIndia has recorded the third-highest number of infections, and the fourth-highest number of deaths, of any country in the world.\nInfections started to dip at the start of 2021, but doctors have blamed a fresh wave on poor adherence to restrictions.\nIn recent weeks Maharashtra, which has long been a virus hotspot, has accounted for the majority of new infections.\nSeven other states - including Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh - are also reporting a resurgence of Covid-19.\nSome regions in India have brought back restrictions, including lockdowns and restaurant closures, while more are believed to be considering similar moves.\nWith the easing of restrictions and life returning to normal in the densely packed cities, Indians have been lax in following Covid-19 safety protocols.\nBut what is still unclear at the moment is whether new variants of the virus are responsible for the new infections. \nTwo variants are under investigation for possible links with the uptick in cases in a few states.\nMuch of the blame, however, should lie with the authorities, who many believe have been equally lax in enforcing Covid-19 measures.\nThe cricket board allowed tens of thousands of spectators, mostly unmasked, to pack a stadium for a match in western Ahmedabad city last week, even as infections were climbing.\nElsewhere, Covid-19 tests will reportedly not be required for thousands of pilgrims expected to take a holy dip at an upcoming Hindu religious festival in Uttarakhand state.\nIn this context, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for states to contain the spread of infections sounds disingenuous. There is a clear and present danger of India frittering away the \"advantage\" of bringing new infections down to lower levels in February.\nThe vaccination drive began in January in India, a country of more than 1.3 billion people. \nMore than 40 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine so far.\nThe rollout is currently targeting elderly people and those with underlying health conditions, but it is expected to expand further soon.\nThe government aims to use up to 500 million doses to cover 250 million \"priority people\" by the end of July.\nAlthough the pace of vaccination has picked up, experts say unless the drive is scaled up the target could be missed.\nPrime Minister Modi, 70, received a dose on 1 March. After receiving the jab, he urged people to take the vaccine when their turn comes."

      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

I'm not going to rule anything in or anything out.\n\"I think the first thing is we are not going to do anything that puts at risk this national effort to control this pandemic. All the indications are in the right direction at the moment and let's take it step by step.\"\nWhen asked about trips abroad, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, told Andrew Marr it was \"too early to say\".\n\"I think everyone has to wait and see. We really don't know. The situation changes so quickly. Numbers are going up at the moment in continental Europe and that's very concerning,\" she said.\nShe added that she hoped countries on the continent can get their vaccine programmes \"on track\" to mitigate the rise in cases.\n\"But obviously the safest thing is to stay where you are. And to avoid anything that increases your risk and I think it's really too early to say what sort of summer we might be able to experience,\" Dr Ramsay said.\nShe added that even those who have been vaccinated could potentially still transmit the virus, saying that restrictions could last for \"quite a long period of time\".\nShadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told Andrew Marr that she will not be booking a foreign holiday.\n\"I know everyone is desperate to go on holiday but we have got to proceed with caution. \n\"We can't allow the good work that has been done from the vaccine rollout to be unravelled by unlocking too quickly or by failing to secure our borders.\"\nMs Nandy added: \"We do need to be careful, we do need to be cautious, and frankly I haven't booked a foreign holiday for this summer and I won't be doing so because I don't think we're there yet.\"\nHalf of all UK adults have now received a first dose of a vaccine, with Friday being a record day for Covid jabs - a combined 711,156 first and second doses were given.\nBut Sir David King, former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, said despite the vaccine rollout, the UK should not become \"complacent\".\n\"We know that new variants have recently appeared in France, in California, in the Philippines and in Brazil. And in the UK there are now already 300 cases of the South African variant.\n\"I don't think that we can be complacent about any of this because we don't know what the vaccine efficacy is with these new variants. So we need to be very, very cautious in the management of the travel business.\"\nDr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Sage group of government science advisers, said on Saturday the UK faces a \"real risk\" if people travel abroad, adding that international travel for the summer was \"extremely unlikely\".\nSeparately, Mr Wallace said the EU should not \"build walls\" around the distribution of jabs following a threat by the European Commission to block vaccine exports to countries including the UK."

Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April.\nThe most-recent issues with supplies meant the vaccine rollout would be \"slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves\", Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Friday.\nThose with appointments for second doses should attend as normal and it is expected April could see more second doses than first doses for the first time.\nAlongside the Oxford vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the UK has also approved a third vaccine - from Moderna - which is due to start being rolled out in late spring.\nA vaccine from Novavax has shown promising results and will be made in north-east England, and a single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson has also been shown to be effective."

It belongs to the British people.\n\"So I say, let's invest it in a sovereign green wealth fund. Let's invest this windfall from wind power into more climate action, to build new infrastructure and attract more private investment.\"\nHe said by using the money to invest in green technologies - such as tidal power and hydrogen - the UK could \"grow our green wealth even further\" and create \"thousands of manufacturing jobs\". \nThe Lib Dems also proposed a new tax break for small businesses to support new jobs as part of the Covid economic recovery. \nSir Ed called on the chancellor to slash National Insurance contributions for smaller firms by quadrupling the annual Employment Allowance from \u00a34,000 to \u00a316,000 .\nEmployers would not have to pay any National Insurance for their first five employees, he said.\nHe called it a \"tax cut to back small businesses, create jobs, and put recovery first\"."

      "text": "Thousands of people have attended anti-lockdown demonstrations in London, after MPs urged the government to allow peaceful protest during lockdown.\nCrowds marched from Hyde Park to Westminster, with at least 33 arrests by police, mostly for Covid breaches.\nScotland Yard said the number of people attending Saturday's demonstrations exceeded expectations.\nThe Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend protests under the current coronavirus rules.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told the BBC more people than previously expected were at Saturday's protests, but the Met has not given a formal estimate of the number in attendance.\nBBC correspondent Marianna Spring, reporting from the anti-lockdown protests, said the atmosphere was \"animated\" and a number of people appeared to be angry about restrictions on peaceful protest.\nLater, in Hyde Park, police officers were forced to run back to their vans, as protesters threw bottles and cans at them.\nPA Media reported that some members of the public then left the park, with small children carried by their parents.\nThe anti-lockdown protests came after a vigil following the death of Sarah Everard in south London last week resulted in arrests, as police enforced Covid and public order laws.\nEarlier, more than 60 MPs and peers wrote to the home secretary calling for laws to be changed to allow peaceful protests during lockdown.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey blamed the scenes at the Clapham event on a lack of clarity putting police \"in an impossible position\", adding that the right to protest was a \"basic freedom\".\nBy Jon Donnison, news correspondent \nThousands of tightly-packed anti-lockdown protesters marched up Whitehall with some chanting \"freedom\" to the beat of a drum. \nOne man carried a placard bearing the words \"no more NHS and Gov lies\".\nI have seen very few demonstrators wearing masks and there's no attempt at social distancing. So far the police - who are here in large numbers - have been taking a hands-off approach, though I have seen at least one arrest on Whitehall.\nAmong the crowd there are undoubtedly some conspiracy theorists, with some accusing the mainstream media of pushing fake news. But that is by no means everyone here. \nOne woman, who did not want to be named, told me she knew Covid was bad. \"I had it myself last March,\" she said. \"But this lockdown is too much.\"\nThe letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch, urged her to issue guidance to police forces on \"facilitating\" protests.\nThe initial organisers of the Sarah Everard vigil effectively lost a High Court battle to hold it lawfully the day before, resulting in its cancellation.\nBut hundreds attended Clapham Common to gather around tributes left on a bandstand - the Met Police said the gathering became unlawful after people began delivering speeches to the crowd.\nThe event also increased interest in plans to give officers more precise powers to restrict demonstrations in a new sweeping Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill debated by MPs.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, told MPs earlier this month that protests elsewhere had not resulted in a spike in infections and that outdoor gatherings were safer than indoors, though not risk free.\nHe said: \"It is the case that it is difficult to see how things like large beach gatherings and so on can cause a spike. The same was the case in a protest march in New York; they did not really see any spikes after that. \n\"It is lower risk, but the other thing that can happen with outdoor events, and so on, is that, when indoor things are also open, you start to get people congregating indoors around that. That can increase risk, but outdoors itself is lower risk.\""

It's a major issue,\" Mr Glen said. \nFrom 1 April security staff must have first aid qualifications before taking the training required to be a door supervisor, according to the Security Industry Authority, the government's regulatory body for the sector.\nThere are additional training requirements related to terror threats and emergencies, the use of body-worn video recorders, and breathalysers. Some of the new requirements start in April, some in October.\nThe UKDSA said it supported the additional elements in the new training regime but said it was \"deeply concerned about the timing of these changes and the impact on front-line staffing levels\".\nMichael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said: \"We rely heavily on licensed door supervisors to keep staff and customers safe. \n\"With the additional responsibility of public health\u2026 it is even more important that we remove barriers to ensure that we are able to fulfil the resource requirement.\n\"This will need a government intervention to ensure that the industry has the ability to provide enough staff. While the training is welcomed, it is not timely given the current economic situation across most of the sector, and consideration needs to be given to it being pushed back to 2022.\"\nThe extent to which non-UK nationals working the industry have returned overseas, further reducing the pool of available staff, is hard to quantify.\nHowever academic studies have found there was a significant exodus of foreign-born UK residents between 2019 and 2020."

      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "The House of Lords has voted to reject controversial changes to the way protests are policed.\nThe government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will now go back to the House of Commons so MPs can respond.\nThe bill is a mammoth piece of legislation which includes major government proposals on crime and justice in England and Wales. It needs to be passed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords to become law.\nThe government has been defeated in the House of Lords on some of the bill's most contentious parts, including plans to give the police new powers to stop protests in England and Wales if they are deemed to be too noisy and disruptive.\nThe Lords also added some proposals of their own to the bill, including one to make misogyny a hate crime.\nThe bill now faces going back and forth between the Commons and Lords until agreement is reached.\nBut some of the measures that the Lords rejected cannot now feature in the final legislation, because of the way the government introduced them.\nThese include one of most high-profile proposals, which would have made it illegal for protesters like Insulate Britain to cause serious disruption by locking themselves to things.\nThis measure could now only be brought back by the government in a new bill.\nIf the police want to restrict a protest, they generally have to show it may result in \"serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community\". \nThey can also impose specific measures on the routes of marches.\nWhen it comes to major events, such as the COP26 protests, details around protests are typically agreed with the organisers weeks in advance.  \nPolice chiefs would be able to put more conditions on static protests, such as those organised by Extinction Rebellion where roads and bridges are occupied.\nThey would be able to:\nSo if a single individual was holding a protest placard while sharing their views via a loudspeaker, and refused to follow police directions about how they should conduct their protest, they could be fined up to \u00a32,500. \nIt would also become a crime to fail to follow restrictions the protesters \"ought\" to have known about, even if they have not received a direct order from an officer. \nAt present, police need to prove protesters knew they had been told to move on, before they can be said to have broken the law. \nThe proposed law also includes an offence of \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\". \nThis is designed to stop people occupying public spaces, hanging off bridges or employing other similar tactics.\nAnother measure clarifies that damage to memorials could lead to up to 10 years in prison. This follows the toppling of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. \nThe four people who had been accused of illegally removing the statue were recently cleared of criminal damage at Bristol Crown Court.\nThe right to protest and express yourself is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. Police commanders have to show they have taken this into account. \nBut that right is not absolute. Protests can be limited by police if they believe they have good reason to impose restrictions on an event to ensure public safety, or to prevent crime. \nThe Home Office insists its proposals do respect human rights. \nBut the history of public protest is littered with long and complex legal battles over whether police have used their powers properly. \nOne of the most important cases - about the police's power to contain a crowd for an indefinite period - took 11 years of courtroom arguments before concluding that the tactic was lawful. \nThe Labour Party opposes the bill in its current form. \nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper says the legislation has been \"rushed\" and will create \"incredibly widely-drawn\" powers, \"for example, allowing the police to stop and search anyone in the vicinity of a protest, including passers-by, people on the way to work and peaceful protesters\".\nGreen party peer Baroness Jones described the government's plans as \"oppressive\" and \"plain nasty\".\nRights of Women, a campaign group, says the bill fails to introduce long-called-for measures that could reduce violence against women and girls, such as providing more support in communities.\nHowever, the government says that other parts of the legislation toughen sentencing for serious violent and sexual offences and introduce new police bail rules for suspects under investigation. \nThe bill would also place a legal duty on police and local authorities to come up with a joint action plan to tackle serious violence.

The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "text": "A critical care nurse who tearfully urged the public to stop panic buying last year has said she is considering leaving her profession.\nDawn Bilbrough said the past year had been \"relentless, incredibly traumatic and emotionally and physically exhausting\".\nHer video message in March 2020 went viral after she found supermarket shelves empty following a 48-hour week.\nMs Bilbrough told the BBC the \"burden\" of seeing patients die had been \"hard\".\nThe 52-year-old, from York, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that nothing in her 20-year nursing career could have prepared her for the last 12 months.   \nSpeaking as the anniversary of her video approached, she said: \"There have been times when I've come home and had a good cry, because we have witnessed so much\u2026 we're at the patient's bedside 12 hours a day and they haven't had that usual psychological support from their families. \n\"So we've been there\u2026 and got to know them as people, their likes and dislikes, their dreams; and then they've become really unwell and been placed on ventilators and quite often they haven't got through that. \n\"And that's been difficult because personally I've felt a bond to my patients, and to witness them not progress as we would wish, that's been really hard.\"\nIn the viral video, taken following a visit to a supermarket after she finished her working week, Ms Bilbrough pleaded with people to stop panic buying so she could purchase food. \n\"There's no fruit and veg, I had a little cry in there,\" she said.\nMs Bilbrough later went on to develop coronavirus symptoms.\nShe has now described seeing coronavirus patients die as a \"burden\" she has to bear. In normal times, she might lose a patient in intensive care once every two weeks, but during the pandemic several were dying every day. \nIn the last wave over winter, she said more died than survived.  \n\"I was once working in a pod where there were four patients with Covid,\" she said.\n\"I left my shift at 20:00 in the evening. When I returned the next day all the patients had died, and were replaced with different people\u2026 although it's hard bearing this burden, you don't become desensitised - if you do, it's time to give up the profession.\"\nMs Bilbrough warned the pandemic was not over and that it was \"shocking\" that those on ventilators now are often in their 50s.\n\"What we have at the moment is an awful lot of patients that remain on ventilators that have been on them since January... we've got young people that are still needing that support. So it's quite shocking,\" she added.\nAmid calls for a better pay rise for nurses, Ms Bilbrough said the public has \"huge respect for the profession, and I do hope it will continue when people go back to their normal lives\u2026 I hope they remember the sacrifices and the burdens that people within the profession have made over the past year and will continue to make for a little while longer\".\nMs Bilbrough said she has not dealt with the emotions of the most challenging year of her career because she has had to get on with her job.\nShe expressed her hope for support for the long-term stress, anxiety and depression those in her profession are experiencing.\n\"There's just this overwhelming sense of sadness that creeps in\u2026 and I think we have to kind of bury that because we're professionals and we can't explore that too deeply when we're at work,\" she said.\n\"So we're\u2026carrying it around with us and for me, it's starting to come up a little bit and it needs to be addressed and processed, and it's going to take some time.\" "

      "tags": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,International aid",
      "text": "The government's decision to cut foreign aid without passing new legislation has been called unlawful by an ex-director of public prosecutions.\nLord Macdonald of River Glaven said No 10 acted outside the law when it ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national income on aid.\nHis formal legal opinion was commissioned by senior Tory MPs campaigning to reverse the aid cut.\nThe advice says No 10's decision could be tested in court via judicial review.\nHowever, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said the government had acted in accordance with the International Development Act 2015 - a piece of legislation that enshrines the 0.7% target in law - and remained a world-leading aid donor, spending \u00a310bn on aid this year.\nLast autumn, the government said it would not meet the 0.7% target in the coming financial year and cut spending to just 0.5% of national income - a move that would save about \u00a34bn a year.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the cut was needed to save money during the pandemic, and would be \"temporary\".\nBut opponents claimed the decision was politically motivated and designed to attract voters in so-called \"red wall\" constituencies held by Conservatives in the north of England.\nLabour's Preet Kaur Gill said cutting the aid budget would \"strip life-saving support from millions of people leaving them to die\".\nShe called on the government to put the change to a vote in Parliament, adding: \"Failure to do so will diminish Britain's claim to be a global force for good and weaken our credibility and ability to defend the rule of law around the world.\"\nAlthough the 0.7% is enshrined in law, ministers have claimed the legislation allows them to miss the target, just so long as they explain to parliament why they have done so.\nBut Lord Macdonald's legal advice - which was first reported by the Sunday Times - disagrees and says the law does not give Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab any right to change the 0.7% target, which is different from missing it.\nThe crossbench peer, who was previously affiliated with the Liberal Democrats, is one of the best known names in British legal circles of the past 25 years. \nAs Ken McDonald, he was a co-founder of London-based Matrix Chambers with other leading lawyers at the start of this century, including Tony Blair's wife Cherie Booth. The newly-established barristers' chambers specialised in a number of high-profile human rights cases.\nHe later became the first defence lawyer to be appointed to the role of director of public prosecutions.\nThe current advice is issued by Matrix Chambers and states: \"The Secretary of State's decision is unlawful, not because of a (mere) failure to meet the 0.7% GNI target, but because the secretary of state has proceeded on the erroneous assumption that he has some power to alter the target itself.\"\nIt adds: \"The illegality of the\u2026decision is clear: the secretary of state proceeded on the erroneous assumption that he was free to establish a \"target\" for official development assistance which is below 0.7% GNI. \n\"In truth, no such discretion was open to him. For that reason, his decision is arguably ultra vires the 2015 Act.\"\nAndrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, is urging the government to put the change to the aid target up for a House of Commons vote.\nThe Conservative MP said: \"This legal opinion, finding that the government's decision is 'unlawful' and that the government's 'illegality is clear', is not unexpected. \n\"The foreign secretary told the Commons that his own legal advice required a change in the legislation, in order to change the 0.7% target. That's why I have been urging ministers to address this in parliament. \n\"I still believe that it is not too late to change course, before the start of the new financial year in April.\"\nBaroness Sugg, the former international development minister who quit her role over the cut to the aid target, said: \"Britain, as a force for good, sets global standards and defends the rules based international system. \n\"Legal opinion like this risks undermining our credibility on the world stage at the very moment we need to strike trade deals, negotiate communiqu\u00e9s and agree ambitious legally binding climate targets.\"\nOxfam GB's chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said: \"The decision was clearly immoral, now it appears to have been unlawful as well.\"\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office insisted the government had acted in accordance with the International Development Act  - which explicitly envisaged circumstances when the 0.7% target was not met. \nIt added the government had sought legal advice throughout the process and remained a world-leading donor, spending \u00a310bn on aid this year.\nA statement from the FCDO said: \"The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid.\n\"The UK government has acted in accordance with the International Development Act 2015 throughout this process.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nThe Office for National Statistics has said this year's census will provide insights into the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit on people's lives. The once-in-a-decade survey of people living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will for the first time include voluntary questions for over-16s on gender identity and sexual orientation. Questionnaires are completed online. In Scotland, the census has been delayed to March next year because of Covid restrictions. Meanwhile, have a million people left the UK?\nLast March, critical care nurse Dawn Bilbrough filmed a tearful video message urging the public to stop panic buying after she found supermarket shelves empty following a 48-hour week. A year on, she has told the BBC that she is considering quitting her profession, admitting the \"burden\" of seeing patients die during the pandemic has been \"hard\". The 52-year-old from York said the past year had been \"relentless, incredibly traumatic and emotionally and physically exhausting\".\nAirline passenger numbers fell 75.6% worldwide last year, and coronavirus vaccines are seen as a key part of reviving the industry. The boss of Australian airline Qantas believes governments will \"insist\" on jabs for international travellers. And even if they do not, Qantas should enforce its own policy, chief executive Alan Joyce told the BBC.\nThe government's announcement last year that it would cut its foreign aid target from 0.7% to just 0.5% of national income sparked widespread criticism. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said at the time it was hard to \"justify\" the spending with the UK facing record borrowing because of the pandemic. But the government's failure to pass new legislation has been called unlawful by a former director of public prosecutions.\nLockdown restrictions have led many to rethink who they want to isolate with. For Orla Smyth, she chose to move in with her mother, Therese Smyth, for the last two weeks of her life. Her mother, who lived with cancer for 10 years, relocated to a Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast when her condition deteriorated.

      "text": "Protesters have attacked police after thousands of people turned up to a demonstration that officers had \"strongly advised\" against attending. \nOfficers suffered broken bones and police vans were set alight as angry scenes unfolded in Bristol city centre.\nCrowds had gathered for the Kill the Bill demonstration in opposition to the Police and Crime Bill.\nDemonstrators scaled a police station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel described the events as \"unacceptable\".\n\"Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,\" she said. \"Our police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect us all.\"\nAvon and Somerset Police said what had started \"as a peaceful protest\" had been \"turned by a small minority into a violent disorder\".\nTwo police vehicles were set on fire, damage was caused to a police station, one officer suffered a broken arm and another suffered broken ribs, the force added.\nBy Joanna Prior, BBC News\nAt the beginning of the night the mood was generally lively but not aggressive. \nThere was broken glass across the road and some people had climbed on top of traffic lights but there was no police intervention.\nThe dense crowd eventually splintered, with some moving away to carry on drinking and listen to music. \nThe atmosphere among those who remained became more volatile. \nRiot police in full protective gear formed a barricade in front of the station, but the officers didn't engage with the protesters at all. \nThey stood by as their shields and vans were daubed with graffiti - some of it profane and some of it hostile towards the police themselves and Home Secretary Priti Patel.\nThen the atmosphere took a marked turn when the first police vehicle was set on fire. Huge plumes of black smoke rose up from Bridewell Street. \nA small number of protesters jumped on to the roof of a second police van, thumping on the glass as the officers tried to reverse. \nObjects were being thrown by protesters into the crowd and still the police did not move from their positions.\nAs well as the police vehicles set on fire, others were smashed up and their tyres let down as the crowd chanted \"shame on you\".\nPolice said perpetrators would be \"identified and brought to justice\".\nIt is not clear if any arrests have been made but a spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said there would be \"significant consequences for behaviour such as this\".\nAvon and Somerset Police Federation chairman Andy Roebuck said: \"This is the worst violence in Bristol for many, many years. \n\"It's really unprecedented violence. Between four and six or possibly more officers are seriously injured and some have broken bones.\n\"No-one had any indication it would erupt this way.\"\nBristol mayor Marvin Rees said he recognised \"the frustrations\" with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but said that \"smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through\". \nThangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary and MP for Bristol West, added: \"The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people, including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest.\"\nDarren Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West, tweeted that the scenes in the city were \"completely unacceptable\".\n\"You don't campaign for the right to peaceful protest by setting police vans on fire or graffitiing buildings,\" he said.\nVideos on Twitter showed protesters rocking and kicking a police van while officers on horseback were pushed by the crowd.\n\"Officers are continuing to deal with a smaller number of protesters in Bridewell Street,\" a police spokesman said earlier.\n\"They've had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused.\n\"This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice.\"\nCampaigners have staged a string of protests against the bill, which would give the police more powers to deal with non-violent demonstrations. \nMany attendees in Bristol wore face masks and carried placards with slogans such as: \"Say no to UK police state\", \"Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy\", and \"Kill the Bill\".\nAvon and Somerset Police had encouraged people to stay away from the demo and attend virtual protests instead.\nMass gatherings are currently banned under coronavirus legislation and anyone breaching regulations could be fined, though some MPs have said the law should change to allow protests.\nThis weekend has seen a number of protests and demonstrations, with campaigners gathering in support of various causes. \nHave you witnessed the protests?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Qantas,Aerospace,Air travel,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "The boss of Australian airline Qantas has told the BBC that \"governments are going to insist\" on vaccines for international travellers.\nCoronavirus vaccines are seen as crucial to reviving an industry that saw worldwide passenger numbers fall 75.6% last year. \nChief executive Alan Joyce said many governments were talking about vaccination as \"a condition of entry\". \nEven if they weren't, he thought the airline should enforce its own policy.\n\"We have a duty of care to our passengers and to our crew, to say that everybody in that aircraft needs to be safe,\" Mr Joyce said. \nHe believes that would justify changing the terms and conditions on which tickets are booked. \nAnd Mr Joyce thinks passengers would be willing to accept the change. \"The vast majority of our customers think this is a great idea - 90% of people that we've surveyed think it should be a requirement for people to be vaccinated to travel internationally.\"  \nBut some powerful voices are among those who disagree, including the World Health Organisation. Its director of digital health and innovation, Bernardo Mariano, told the BBC: \"We don't approve the fact that a vaccinations passport should be a condition for travel.\" \nHe added that - regardless of what the private sector wanted - a unified approach from governments would be needed to make such a change work. \nAviation is vital to the global economy. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that it supports $1.8 trillion (\u00a31.3tn, A$2.3tn) in global economic activity.\nBut government restrictions and fears of catching coronavirus have led to an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers in an industry which carried 4.5 billion people in 2019.  \nAustralia's government has closed its borders to almost all foreigners and has also periodically closed internal borders.\nEven with vaccines, Mr Joyce thinks that \"once we open up our international borders, we're going to have the virus circulating\". \n\"And that's going to be a big change for a lot of Australia, to find that acceptable,\" he said. \"We need people to understand they can't have zero risk with this virus. We manage risk in so many different other ways for other parts of life.\"\nThe lack of passengers means that in the last six months of 2020 Qantas lost $800m (\u00a3580m, A$1.03bn). That compares with a profit of $596m (\u00a3430m, A$771m) in the same period of 2019. It's also meant 8,500 job cuts from a pre-pandemic staff of about 29,000. \nAnd thousands of others are on furlough, with the Australian government paying their wages. Other international carriers have seen similar reversals in their fortunes.\nIn response, airlines have cut their capacity, with huge numbers of aeroplanes put into storage. For Qantas that was about two-thirds of their 314 aircraft. \nAmong them are the airline's fleet of giant, double-decker Airbus A380s, one of which was being refurbished when the pandemic took hold. It \"went from Dresden in Germany where the reconfig took place straight to the Mojave Desert, and nobody sat on those seats\", Mr Joyce said.\nQantas says vaccines will be required to fly \nHaving less supply of any product normally means that prices climb in response to an increase in demand. However, Mr Joyce doesn't think the combination of fewer seats and the easing of restrictions will lead to higher prices. \n\"In some cases, we think the airfares could be half of what they were pre-Covid,\" he said. \"And that will be there to stimulate demand.\"\nIt could be that way for some time. \"Internationally it's going to take a while for it to recover to 2019 levels,\" the airline boss said.\nWhen flights do get going again, the priority will be bringing money in and any surge in demand can be dealt with by bringing more aircraft back into service. \n\"So we're very confident that it's not going to be higher airfares,\" Mr Joyce insisted.\nLast month Qantas pushed back the date at which it expects its international flights to resume from July to the end of October. That's the point at which the Australian government hopes to have vaccinated all adults and the date for which the airline is now selling international tickets.\n\"The number one flight by a significant amount is Perth to London non-stop,\" says Mr Joyce. The demand for the ultra-long haul flights is, he says, \"a good indication\" that after pandemic passengers will try to avoid changeovers in airports filled with other people. \nThat desire to travel direct means \"the business case is probably going to be stronger\" for what Qantas calls \"Project Sunrise\".  It is likely to eventually involve direct flights \"from Sydney and Melbourne non-stop into Europe and non-stop to the east coast of  the United States\", he said.\nTests have already taken place but the launch has been delayed, and is now not expected until 2024.\nAviation is responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions. \nBut Qantas claims to have the \"world's biggest airline carbon offset programme\". It is also investing $38.7m (\u00a328m, A$50m) in a partnership with BP to develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. In addition, it said it was looking at technology such as more fuel-efficient planes as well as electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles.\n\"I think you have to do it,\" Mr Joyce said. Spending money to cut emissions, he says, shows \"it's not just a focus on the bottom line\".\n\"You have to actually do the right thing by the environment, do the right thing by society. Otherwise, you don't have a social licence to operate in the future.\"\nTo keep the finances on course during the pandemic Qantas has raised $770,000 (\u00a3560,000, A$1m) by selling bar carts that in-flight drinks were served from on its now-retired Boeing 747s, as well as wine in plastic bottles and a stock of the quintessentially Australian chocolate biscuit, Timtams. \nMr Joyce says: \"You just have to have that flexibility, that adaptability, to survive.\" \n\"It's the reason why Qantas survived for 100 years\" and is the oldest continuous operating airline in the world, he said.\n\"That's part of our DNA. That's why we're going to survive for at the least the next 100 years.\"\nYou can watch Alan Joyce's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 2330 GMT,  Sunday  0530GMT, 1630 GMT,  Monday 0730 GMT, 1130 GMT and  Tuesday at 1330 GMT."

      "text": "A court in Pakistan has sentenced two men to death for a rape which triggered public outrage.\nAbid Malhi and Shafqat Ali Bagga came across a Pakistani-French woman and her two children stranded on a motorway.\nThe men broke into their car, which had run out of petrol on the road near Lahore, robbed them and raped the woman in front of her children. \nLater comments by a policeman, who questioned why the woman had been out late on her own, led to mass protests.\nOn Saturday, a special court in the eastern city of Lahore convicted Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali of gang rape, kidnapping, robbery and terrorism offences.\nTheir lawyer said they would appeal against the decision, according to the AFP news agency.\nOn 9 September 2020, the woman - whose name has not been publicly released - ran out of fuel on a motorway leading out of Lahore. Her two children were with her.\nShe called her relatives in Gujranwala who advised her to call the motorway emergency numbers and also set off to help her.\nAccording to the complaint registered with the police by one of the woman's relatives, the car was broken into by two men in their early to mid-30s who stole money and jewellery she had on her. They raped her in front of her two children in a nearby field, and then escaped.\nPolice say the woman was traumatised, although she did provide them with some basic descriptions of her attackers.\nThe next day the most senior police official in Lahore, Umer Sheikh, appeared in front of the media and implied that she had been partly to blame. He questioned why she had not taken a busier road, given that she had been alone with her children, or checked her fuel before departing.\nIn several TV appearances he reiterated these points, also adding that the woman, who is a resident of France, seemed to be operating under the impression Pakistan was as safe as France.\nThe reaction was like nothing seen in the country before and came from all quarters.\nOn social media people called him out for his victim-blaming.\nThousands of people across Pakistan also took part in protests, demanding justice and better protection of women in the country.\nIn December, new rape laws were passed, offering faster trials and tougher sentences."

      "text": "US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan, weeks before a planned withdrawal of all remaining US troops.\nAfter meeting President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul, he called for a responsible end to the war but would not say whether the deadline would be met.\nMr Austin said the focus should be on reducing high levels of violence to allow a negotiated end to the conflict.\nThe pullout was agreed with the Taliban by the Trump administration last year.\nBut there are questions over whether the insurgents have kept their pledge to negotiate with the Afghan government.\nNew US President Joe Biden has said the 1 May deadline would be tough to meet, prompting warnings of \"consequences\" from the Taliban.\nMr Austin is the first member of Mr Biden's cabinet to visit Afghanistan. He flew into Kabul on Sunday at the end of a brief tour of Asia.\nSpeaking to journalists, Mr Austin would not say whether the Taliban had met their obligations under the recent deal.\n\"It's obvious that the level of violence remains pretty high in the country,\" he said, quoted by the New York Times. \n\"We'd really like to see that violence come down, and I think if it does come down it can begin to set the conditions for some really fruitful diplomatic work.\"\nThere are fears that if foreign militaries withdraw before a lasting agreement is reached, the Taliban might return to power.\nThe US says it has some 2,500 troops still in Afghanistan.\nThe Trump administration made withdrawing troops from Afghanistan a priority.\nThe deal signed in February 2020 said that the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled, and proceeding with national peace talks.\nAlthough the Taliban, a hard-line Islamist movement, stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government.\nAs a condition of starting negotiations with the Afghan government, the Taliban also demanded that thousands of their men be released in a prisoner swap. \nDirect talks then began Doha in September 2020, but a breakthrough has still not been reached."

He rang me at 09:15 on the Wednesday and said to me in Welsh 'I've never been so ill in my life'.\"\nMrs Williams said he was \"a wonderful husband and was brilliant with our disabled son\". \n\"He carried so much of the burden when I was back and forth to London. His two grandsons in Groeslon miss him dearly. They thought the world of him.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford stopped short of saying a review would be held into DNR orders when asked during an interview on BBC Politics Wales.\nHe said guidance had been given to the health service in Wales \"early on in the coronavirus crisis\" by the chief medical officer after a GP practice sent an \"unfortunate letter\" to patients last April asking them to sign DNR consent forms.\n\"If there's more to find out then we will definitely want to find out. I completely agree with that,\" he said.\n\"But I also want to be clear that, because we had an early incident, we were on top of this issue from right at the start of the pandemic.\"\nFollowing the publication of the Care Quality Commission's report into cases in England, the Welsh Conservatives said they \"pressed for clarity over this issue in Wales\" because they felt \"none has really been forthcoming\".\nAngela Burns MS, the party's health spokeswoman, said: \"It's now essential that we have transparency over this matter, which mean some difficult and uncomfortable questions will need to be asked, and answered, including how many DNR notices have been applied in Wales without consultation - and how many, if any, have been acted on.\""

      "tags": "Flexible working,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Wales business,Cardiff,Cardiff University,Welsh government,Wales economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some of Wales' major employers say they are considering a permanent shift to flexible working after the pandemic.\nThe Welsh government, Cardiff University and Admiral Group say they are all consulting with staff about a hybrid of home and office working.\nHowever, experts say there will always be a place for office working - especially for those starting careers.\nThey say many major organisations will instead have smaller offices and allow more flexible working. \nInsurer the Admiral Group, based in Cardiff, currently has the majority of staff working from home with a very small number working from offices.\nThe company's head of people, Rhian Langham, said staff were telling the company how they wanted to \"embrace all of the best bits of working from home whilst preserving our amazing culture\".\nShe said they were looking at a hybrid of working in the office and from home once buildings could reopen more widely.\n\"Our key considerations are our commitment to great customer service and ensuring we keep our unique culture alive and thriving, and we believe we can do both in a hybrid working environment,\" she added.\nFigures from the commercial property sector show that, on average, over the past 10 years, office take-up in Cardiff city centre was 350,000 sq ft a year.\nIn 2020 the total was 235,680 sq ft, with 120,000 sq ft of that taken up by Legal and General's new building at Central Square, due to be completed by November 2022. \nCardiff University's five-year lease on its Friary House offices in the city is also up for renewal this year. The university has not confirmed whether it will renew.\nA spokesman said feedback from staff showed many would like to keep some of the working practices they have had to adopt because of Covid.\n\"As part of our thinking, we are also exploring our estate's footprint and the carbon emissions associated with our buildings and commuting to work,\" the university said.\n\"In doing so, we aim to do our part to help reduce Cardiff University's carbon footprint and address climate change.\" \nThe Welsh government has said it wants to give workers more flexibility to work remotely. \nA network of community-based working hubs within walking or cycling distance of people's homes are being considered and could be used by public, private and third-sector employees. \nA spokesman for the government said it was consulting with staff and unions over long-term remote working with \"ambitions\" of having up to 50% of staff working remotely at any one time.\n\"Allowing more staff to work remotely will be key contributor to our carbon reduction aims and result in a fairer distribution of jobs across Wales,\" they said.  \nEarlier this month, oil giant BP told office-based staff they would be expected to spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease.\nAnd last week Blaenau Gwent council set out plans to vacate and demolish its headquarters in favour of hubs and homeworking.\nDr Martin James from Swansea University's School of Management said any recession could contribute to encouraging firms to embrace home working to help reduce costs.\nHowever, he said it was too early to declare \"the death of the office\", although research showed productivity had increased with home working. \nBut Dr James said roles that became fully remote and \"don't require the office dynamic\" were in danger of being outsourced.\n\"A lot of research is going to be happening and strategic thinking at the moment because even relatively minor shifts can lead to profound changes.\"\n\"[That can be] where companies are located and what spaces they are going to retain and - while companies may be holding off from making big decisions in the short term - there is a concern that won't go away and will result in a review, particularly in terms of real estate and commercial property and where they're going to be locating their staff.\"\nCommercial property consultant Chris Sutton said he believed there would always be a place for office working for those starting out in their careers. \n\"One of the casualties of working from home has been personal development and people learning on the job,\" he said.\n\"If you're highly-experienced, you can work remotely but it's difficult for people at the first stages of their career.\"\nMr Sutton said office space had been a key driver of the economy over the past decade, particularly in Cardiff which had seen a total of 1.5 million sq ft of office space developed.\nHe added: \"Those large-scale developments have been a driver of growth for the city centre - it feeds the bars, restaurants and retail and theatre - and the whole city is losing not having staff at full capacity.\n\"We won't see a cliff edge of a large-scale vacation of floor space simply because organisations are tied into long leases, but in time, we will see major organisations having a smaller-scale footprint and allowing more flexible working.\" \nDirector of CBI Wales Ian Price said once lockdown was eased there would need to be a continued collaboration between remote workers and those in the office.\nHe said: \"While Covid-19 has undoubtedly caused real damage across the Welsh economy with too many jobs and livelihoods lost but there has also been real innovation.\n\"Firms have done amazing things to keep operations going and deliver for customers - some that will continue well into the future.\""

He told parliament there was \"serious risk still ahead\".\nSwollen rivers cut off roads and bridges, and almost 200 schools in NSW will remain shut on Tuesday.\nPeople in more than 15 mostly low-lying areas have been ordered to evacuate and a similar number have been given evacuation warnings.\nAn order requires people to seek shelter with family or friends well away from flood impacted areas, or in a special centre. The warning tells people to prepare for an evacuation order.\nAreas north and west of Sydney, the NSW Central Coast and the Hawkesbury valley have been of particular concern.\nThere have been some 15,000 evacuations from the Mid-North Coast and a further 3,000 in Sydney, officials said. \nThe Australian Defence Force will provide search and rescue helicopters on Tuesday, after a request from the NSW government.\nPM Morrison told MPs: \"Across NSW, 1,400 first responders have conducted over 700 flood rescues and responded to over 7,500 requests for assistance.\"\nHe added: \"This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous.\"\nOne stranded family was lifted from their flooded home by a helicopter. Responders also saved a family with a baby from flooding in their home in Sydney's west.\nThere have been images of dead wildlife, livestock floating through flooded areas and rows of houses engulfed up to their windows.\nThe Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers - which border Sydney to the north and west - reached higher levels on Monday than during a devastating flood in 1961.\nMeanwhile, the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, began spilling over for the first time in five years. It reached a peak daily discharge on Sunday of 500 gigalitres - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour - before falling back to 300 GL on Monday.\nOn Sunday a young couple saw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day. Shocked neighbours filmed the uprooted three-bedroom cottage bobbing along the Manning river after it burst its banks.\nIn Port Macquarie's North Shore, one resident was filmed dragging a stingray through what was his front lawn.\nIn south-east Queensland, flash floods also affected Brisbane and the Gold Coast at the weekend.\nConditions in many areas of New South Wales are expected to worsen, with officials warning that two weather systems could collide, creating a \"last blast\" of rain and storms going into Wednesday.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology said heavy rainfall would affect the whole NSW coast and several inland areas on Tuesday, bringing a \"serious risk\" of flash flooding.\n\"This situation is far from over,\" it tweeted.\nBut it added: \"Most areas of New South Wales will see a clearing trend early Wednesday as a drier airmass moves into the region.\"\nIt also sent out a tweet saying 10 million Australians were now under a weather warning - affecting an area the size of Alaska.\nThe bureau said the rainfall so far - up to 90cm in some areas - had been \"extraordinary\", with many areas across NSW resembling an \"inland sea\".\nMs Berejiklian, the NSW premier, said: \"What we're going through now is different to what you've been through for the last 50 years, so please take it seriously.\"\nJamisontown resident Ellen Brabin told ABC News that she had not seen floods as severe as this in more than 40 years.\n\"I've seen all the floods and stuff, and never had to move before so this is different,\" she said.\nThe intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought.\nThis side of the continent is currently experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer.\nTwo of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La Ni\u00f1a events. Typically a La Ni\u00f1a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia.\nScientists say that climate change is also intensifying La Ni\u00f1a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. \nAre you in the affected region?

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus vaccines,Poland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "France and Poland have reintroduced partial lockdowns as both countries battle a sharp rise in Covid infections in recent weeks.\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France, including the capital Paris, are affected as the country fears a third wave.\nIn Poland, non-essential shops, hotels, cultural and sporting facilities are now closed for three weeks.\nThe country has the highest new daily rates of Covid cases since November.\nCoronavirus cases are also rising exponentially in Germany, with Chancellor Angela Merkel warning it is likely that the country will now need to apply an \"emergency brake\" and re-impose lockdown measures.\nThe vaccine rollout across the European Union has been hindered by delayed deliveries, as well as the suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, over fears of possible side effects.\nMeanwhile demonstrations against coronavirus restrictions have affected several European cities.\nIn Amsterdam, police fired water cannon to clear protesters from Museum Square, a frequent venue for unauthorised demonstrations. Online footage showed a police dog handler prodding a woman in the chest with his baton and twice hitting a man who tried to protect her. \nAnd in the central German city of Kassel, police said they used pepper spray and batons to disperse demonstrators who tried to break through a cordon. Video footage posted on social media showed water cannon also being deployed.\n\"This is not what a peaceful protest looks like,\" police tweeted (in German).\nProtesters were also detained during an anti-lockdown protest in Hyde Park, London, and several thousand people gathered to protest against Covid restrictions in the small Swiss town of Liestal, near Basel.\nDemonstrations were also reported in Berlin, Helsinki and Vienna.\nIn France, the partial lockdown took effect from midnight on Friday.\nTrains leaving Paris for parts of the country where lockdown restrictions do not apply, such as Brittany and Lyon, were reportedly fully booked hours before the measures were due to come into effect. \nTraffic jams were reported on several roads leaving the capital.\nThe new restrictions are not be as strict as the previous lockdown, with people allowed to exercise outdoors.\nNon-essential businesses are shut, but schools remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a \"particular sanitary protocol\".\nFrance has reported more than 4.2 million infections since the start of the outbreak, with nearly 92,000 Covid-related deaths, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University in the US.\nThe new lockdown measures are set to last at least four weeks. Paris and its surrounding region, the area around Nice and large parts of northern France are all affected.\nIt is a lighter lockdown than the two previous ones, with the main difference being that during the day people can go outside for exercise for as long as they like. Schools are also staying open.  \nBut leaving the city for the countryside is not allowed, and yesterday there was heavy congestion on the roads and the trains as some Parisians got out while they could to non-lockdown zones.  \nMany in France find the bureaucratic approach of the government annoying, if predictable. \nThe rules on the high street are also opaque. While clothes and DIY shops are shut, hairdressers, bookshops, cobblers and florists are open.\nIn Poland, the three-week lockdown began on Saturday. \nPolish health officials earlier warned the nationwide restrictions were necessary because of a rampant British variant of Covid-19 in the country. The variant now makes up more than 60% of infections.\nPoland has had more than two million confirmed infections, and nearly 49,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nGermany said on Friday it was now classifying neighbouring Poland as high risk. This means that from Sunday anyone crossing the border from Poland must provide a negative coronavirus test. \nDespite assurances from the European medicines regulator that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective, some countries remain reluctant to resume their campaigns using the jab. \nGermany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands are among the countries that have restarted their AstraZeneca vaccination campaigns. \nHealth authorities in France have recommended that the vaccine be offered only to people aged 55 and over. \nFinland's health authority has announced a pause in its use of the vaccine that will last at least a week. That move, which follows two reports of blood clots in patients who had received the jab in the country, was said to be a precautionary measure. \nMeanwhile, Sweden, Denmark and Norway said on Friday that they needed more time to determine whether they should resume AstraZeneca inoculations. \nOn Saturday, Denmark said that two members of hospital staff in Copenhagen had developed blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has reviewed the vaccine over fears of a link to blood clots and found the jab was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of clots.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also urged countries to continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nOn Friday, experts at the WHO said the vaccine had \"tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world\". \nProfessor Sir John Bell, from the UK government's vaccine taskforce, said France's refusal to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s was \"really damaging people's confidence in vaccines generally\".\n\"It doesn't make any sense, the whole thing looks completely crackers,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\n\"If there are clotting problems associated with the vaccines - I am not saying there are, but if there were - they are at a very tiny level compared with the problems you get if you get the disease. If you want to die of a clot, get Covid.\" "

      "text": "An \"extremely rare\" meteor known as a daytime fireball has been blamed for a sonic boom-type noise heard across parts of England.\nPeople in Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Jersey reported hearing a loud bang and seeing a streak of light in the sky on Saturday afternoon.\nAfter analysing pictures and videos, experts confirmed they showed a meteor.\nThey have urged people to keep an eye out and report any fallen fragments of the space rock.\nSimon Proud, a specialist in aviation meteorology at the University of Oxford, captured the meteor - which appeared as a bright flash -  flying over the UK on a weather satellite.\nRichard Kacerek, from the UK Meteor Observation Network of amateur astronomers, said only the brightest \"bolide class\" meteor could produce a rare \"daytime fireball\".\nHe added that the one seen on Saturday would have needed to be \"very large\" to be visible during day.\nDr Ashley King from the UK Fireball Alliance - a group of experts and enthusiasts who hunt for freshly-fallen meteorites - said the fireball \"would have been going faster than the speed of sound\".\n\"Normally when you hear that it's a good sign that you have got rocks that have made it to the surface. It's incredibly exciting and I'm a bit stunned,\" he said.\nThe group has asked people in the Devon, Dorset or Somerset areas to report finds of any fragments - believed to be small blackish stones, or a mound of dark dust.\nData from cameras is also being analysed to give details of the meteor's journey.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Somerset, astronomer and science journalist Will Gater, who was among the first to link the sonic boom to a meteor, said: \"If somehow the location can be pieced together who knows - the thought that something could be recovered is quite exciting.\"\nFollowing the \"huge bang\", which people said shook their homes and windows, an earthquake was ruled out by The British Geological Survey.\nThe Ministry of Defence also said the \"massive bang\" was not linked to any RAF aircraft.\nA campsite near Weymouth captured the loud noise on a security camera.\nIn February a meteor flying across the sky at night was caught on lots of doorbell cameras across the UK.\nSeveral rocky fragments were recovered from the fireball - they came down in the Winchcombe area of Gloucestershire.\nBecause it happened at night cameras were able to record the rock coming through the atmosphere creating a huge fireball in the process.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "A snapshot of life in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is to be captured later when millions of people take part in the once-a-decade census. \nPeople are being asked to complete an online questionnaire about every person living at their property. \nFor the first time it also includes voluntary questions in England and Wales for over-16s on gender identity and sexual orientation.\nBy law, you must complete or be accounted for in the census. \nThose who fail to fill it in or give false information can be fined up to \u00a31,000.\nOn one day every 10 years, households are asked to fill in a questionnaire about every person living at the property, including their age, race, occupation and relationship status.\nThe information gathered provides a snapshot of the population, including its size and the age of people, and is used by charities and hospitals, schools, universities and job centres to plan and fund services.\nBecause of the pandemic, this year people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are being asked to complete the survey online, with unique access codes being sent out to households. In Scotland, the census has been delayed to March 2022 as a result of Covid restrictions.\nIain Bell, deputy national statistician at the ONS, which is organising the census in England and Wales, said: \"It helps us understand what our society needs now and what it will likely need in the future. \n\"We've already had a fantastic response to the census through our engagement work across the country. \n\"Now I'd encourage everyone who can, to complete their questionnaire, whether that be on your laptops, phones or computers.\n\"It takes around 10 minutes per person and if you can't get online, there are paper forms available for those who need them. Now is the time to make your mark on history.\"\nIn addition to new voluntary questions on sexual orientation and gender identity, for the first time people will be asked about whether they have served in the armed forces.\nCampaigners have welcomed the inclusion of a question on gender for the first time as a \"good first step\".\nThis month a High Court judge ruled that a part of the census guidance for England and Wales accompanying the question on a person's sex should be withdrawn, following a legal challenge. \nCensus field officers will follow up with households after Census Day on 21 March if people have not completed their questionnaire.\nResults will be available within 12 months, although personal records will be locked away for 100 years, kept safe for future generations."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Summer holidays overseas are \"extremely unlikely\" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, a scientist on a government advisory body has said.\nThe UK faces a \"real risk\" if people travel abroad, Dr Mike Tildesley said.\nForeign holidays are currently not allowed and returning travellers have to quarantine.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was \"too early to tell\" when holidays abroad would be allowed.\nUnder the current road map for easing restrictions, the earliest date people in England could holiday abroad would be 17 May.\nPeople can currently travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work, with anyone who does having to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form stating a valid reason for leaving the country.\nA government taskforce will report to the prime minister on 12 April detailing when and how international travel can resume.\nIn Scotland, national clinical director Jason Leitch also said foreign summer holidays in Europe were looking \"less likely\" as Covid numbers in some countries were a \"cause for concern\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said on Saturday morning half of all adults in the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine.\nFriday was also a record-breaking day for jabs, Mr Hancock added.\nDr Tildesley, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into Sage, said there was a danger holidaymakers could bring back variants, like the one that emerged in South Africa - which were less susceptible to vaccines.\nDr Tildesley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think that international travel this summer is, for the average holidaymaker, sadly I think, extremely unlikely.\n\"I think we are running a real risk if we do start to have lots of people going overseas in July, for instance, and August because of the potential for bringing more of these new variants back into the country.\n\"What is really dangerous is if we jeopardise our vaccination campaign by having these variants, where the vaccines don't work as effectively, spreading more rapidly.\"\nFuture vaccination campaigns might need to be considered to tackle future variants, but \"the longer that we can push that down the road... the better\", Dr Tildesley added.\nProf Andrew Hayward, from Sage, said it was \"unlikely\" the government would want to encourage travel to European countries currently experiencing high levels of coronavirus infections.\n\"I suppose one of the more worrying things about this resurgence is that in some parts of Europe the South African variant is beginning to creep up to higher levels,\" he told Times Radio.\nHe said this variant was of \"particular concern\" because vaccine effectiveness against it was \"quite low\".\nAirlines UK, which represents UK-registered carriers, said it was \"too early to say\" what the state of Covid will be in Europe and the rest of the world in 10 weeks' time.\n\"We have always said any reopening must be risk-based, but also led by the overriding assumption that as the vaccine rollout accelerates both here and abroad, a phased easing of restrictions is achievable,\" Airlines UK said.\n\"We know that universal, restriction-free travel is unlikely from 17 May but under a tiered system, based on risk, international travel can meaningfully restart and build up, with minimal restrictions in time.\"\nFebruary's announcement of the roadmap for easing restrictions in England was followed by a flurry of reports from airlines and holiday companies that future bookings had surged - particularly from July onwards.\nAlthough domestic operators reported strong demand for UK-based getaways, many people are clearly desperate to go abroad when it is allowed. \nStricken travel and tourism firms desperately need their business. They see this summer as crucial.\nBut although 17 May is in the calendar as the earliest possible date for international leisure trips to resume, this has never been guaranteed. \nNor do passengers yet know exactly what rules or systems might be in place to enable travel to re-start. \nAll eyes will be on what the global travel taskforce reports on 12 April.\nThere are thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid circulating but there has been particular focus on those first found in three countries:\nThese variants could be much more contagious or easy to catch but there is no evidence any of them cause much more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected.\nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus but scientists believe they should still work, although perhaps not quite as well.\nVaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in the future to be a better match.\nRead more.\nMeanwhile, Kate Bingham, the former head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, said some European leaders were being \"completely irresponsible\" over their approach to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\n\"If I was sitting in those countries I would not be happy to have leaders that are undermining a vaccine that could actually protect,\" Ms Bingham told the Daily Telegraph.\nSeveral countries decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following reports some people suffered blood clots after receiving the jab.\nData supplied by AstraZeneca showed there had been fewer than 40 reports of blood clots among the 17 million people across Europe who had been given the vaccine.\nUK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the Covid vaccine caused blood clots and Boris Johnson has said the vaccine is safe - receiving it himself on Friday.\nDr Catherine Smallwood, from the World Health Organization, said: \"We can't talk about the interest of one country or one city or one part of the world, this is so interconnected and we've really got to come out of this together.\"\nProf Sir John Bell, a member of the government's vaccine taskforce, criticised France for changing its vaccine advice, calling it \"crackers\".\nFrance is refusing to give the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s having previously said it was unsuitable for older people - a move Prof Bell said undermined confidence in the vaccination rollout.\n\"It doesn't make any sense. The whole thing looks completely crackers. They are changing the rules almost every week,\" he told Today.\n\"They are really damaging people's confidence in vaccines generally - not just the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\"They are sitting on a massive stockpile of vaccines that they haven't deployed yet and at the same time they have got a massive wave of the new variants coming across the country.\" \nMore than 26 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures."

The police thought they may be staying with a friend,\" said Amy's mother.\n\"My dad came round and stayed up with me through the night. We finally got a call from a police sergeant... to say they'd been found. \"\nMs Greenan said she did not believe the children had deliberately hidden inside the train.\n\"I don't see where you can hide. The train must have been checked. Why weren't they found?\" she said.\nThe children raised the alarm the following morning by waving and banging on the carriage window after spotting a teenager walking nearby, and a conductor unlocked the train. \n\"They were cold and hungry. The station staff got them something to eat and called the police,\" said Ms Greenan.\nA spokesperson for ScotRail said: \"We are assisting British Transport Police with this investigation.\" "

Without it, Keir would have been able to do more in day-to-day politics. We have lived through abnormal times, and although he has been tested by it, there is clearly a lot more to do.\n\"He needs to now pick up speed and work out a real argument and point of difference with the government\"\nHe played down expectations for the forthcoming local elections in England adding: \"I am not expecting a seismic bounce as people are still focussed on putting Covid behind us.\"\nBut he remained optimistic for the party's future, describing Sir Keir as \"a great asset\" and said under his leadership Labour is \"now firmly back in the ring\". \nMany on Labour's Left are concerned that the party will try to move away from some of the radical policies which were adopted under Jeremy Corbyn who remains suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party.\nThe former MP Laura Smith, who lost her Crewe and Nantwich seat in 2019, told the BBC she blamed Brexit, rather than the party's last manifesto, for the election defeat.\nShe argued it would be wrong to move away from policies that were a clear alternative to those offered by the government."

It attracts thousands of students to Florida and other warm-weather destinations around the country.\nOfficials warned tourists to \"vacation responsibly or be arrested\" prior to the holiday period, and a county-wide midnight coronavirus curfew was already in place due to the pandemic.\nBut the Miami Beach area was thronged with revellers over the weekend, and many did not appear to be wearing masks or socially distancing.\nOne city official described South Beach, which includes the world-famous Ocean Drive, as being \"overwhelmed\" by crowds on Saturday.\n\"You couldn't see pavement and you couldn't see grass,\" city manager Raul Aguila said.\nHe added that the emergency measures were \"necessary not only to protect our residents but our visitors, including our spring breakers who we want to keep safe\".\nOn Sunday, Miami Beach police told CNN they had arrested at least a dozen people after the curfew had come into force. The Miami Herald newspaper said police used pepper-spray balls to enforce the curfew.\nUntil the measures are lifted, police will prevent pedestrians and vehicles from entering the South Beach area's main party strips.\nOn Sunday, the Miami Beach city commission voted to extend the curfew and other measures for up to three more weeks.\nAt an emergency meeting, Mayor Gelber told the commission South Beach had become \"a tinder over the last couple of weeks\".\nHe said tourists had flooded into the city since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the state an \"oasis of freedom\" from coronavirus restrictions late last month.\nFlorida continues to be a coronavirus hotspot in the US. The state has recorded nearly two million of the country's 29 million infections since the pandemic began.\nThe latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows Florida has recorded about 4,300 new infections a day on average over the past week."

      "text": "There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. \nIf you have any of them, you should get a test.\nPublic Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one of these symptoms.\nPeople infected with new variants such as Delta may be more likely to have other symptoms, such as headache, sore throat or a runny nose, according to research from the Zoe Covid Study and an ONS survey.\nIf you have any symptoms you should get tested as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason. \nIt takes five days on average from the moment you're infected for symptoms to show.\nNo - it can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.\nScientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types:\nResearchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus in children.\nSome people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes or fingers.\nIt can happen to anyone, but is more common in children and teenagers. \nFor some it's painless, but the rash can be very sore and itchy.\nIt appears to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus.\nWriting in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers say they've pinpointed which parts of the immune system are responsible, which should lead to better treatments. \nLots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu. \nPublic Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it.\nIf you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started.\nMost people will only have mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and fluids.\nYou should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.\nSince 16 August, people who are double jabbed (or aged under 18) don't have to self-isolate if they're identified as a close contact of a person who tests positive.\nGetting vaccinated is the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation or death from Covid. \nIf you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you can't speak more than a few words.\nIf you're worried your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen.\nThe most seriously ill patients may require ventilation - where patients are sedated and air is pushed into their lungs.\nOlder people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "title": "When do I need to complete the census by?",
      "text": "People are being asked to fill in their census as soon as possible. \nThe once-a-decade Census day took place on Sunday 21 March. \nThe survey aims to provide a snapshot of life in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which can be used by organisations to help make sure they provide the right services for people. \nA census is a count of all people and households in an area.\nCensuses have been conducted since ancient times, to assess the size of a population and calculate what they need. The first UK census was in 1801. \nOn one day every 10 years, households are asked to fill in a questionnaire about every person living at the property, including their age, race, occupation and relationship status.\nThe information gathered provides a snapshot of the population, including its size and the age of people.\nThis is used by charities and services like hospitals, schools, universities and job centres to plan and fund services including transport, education and healthcare.  \nCensus day this year was on Sunday 21 March for households in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nPeople who haven't filled it in by that date are being asked to do so as soon as possible. \nThe Scotland census will now be in March 2022. Coronavirus restrictions mean preparations haven't taken place, the National Records of Scotland said.\nBy law, you must complete or be accounted for in the census.\nYou can be fined up to \u00a31,000 if you do not fill it in, or give false information. \nYou do not have to answer the questions marked as voluntary.\nPeople staying in the UK for under three months do not have to fill out a census, but everyone else should be covered by one - including students and those who have gone abroad for under a year.\nIn late March and early April, census field officers may visit your household if you haven't submitted a form. \nThey will encourage you to complete it and show you how to get further help if needed. \nThe field officers will be wearing PPE and won't need to enter your house.\nEvery householder must either answer the questions for everyone living there, or make sure each person answers their own.\nThis year, people are being asked to fill the census out online using an access code sent in the post. \nYou can do this on a computer, mobile phone or tablet and should submit the survey on Sunday 21 March, or as soon as possible afterwards.\nYou can also request a paper version online, or over the phone.\nFor the first time, there will be voluntary questions on gender identity and on sexual orientation for over-16s.\nIn the UK, there are no official figures for those who identify their gender as different from the sex registered at birth. Gathering this information will help develop policy, provide services and improve equality, the ONS says. \nHowever, the question \"What is your sex?\" has proved controversial. The ONS had to change its guidance after campaigners argued it was \"unlawful\" people were told they could use the sex recorded on their passport, as this can be changed without a legal process. \nThe High Court ruled online guidance - not in the paper versions of the census - must make it clear the question can only be answered by reference to a birth certificate or gender recognition certificate, which allows trans people to change their legal gender. \nProf Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's National Statistician, has suggested the 2021 census  could be the last one, as he is looking into cheaper and more up-to-date alternatives.\nHis team will work out whether accurate information could be obtained from other sources such as the Ordnance Survey, GP lists, council tax records and driving licence details.\nCombined with regular, large-scale population surveys, this could provide better and more detailed information in a cheaper and more timely way, he says. No decisions have yet been taken.\nWhile information gathered in censuses is anonymised for service providers to use, the full census isn't made available to the public for 100 years.\nLots of people are keen to read the 1921 census to learn more about their family history. \nBut that won't be published until early 2022, according to the National Archives."

      "tags": "Pakistan,Family,Walsall,Nursing,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nurse Areema Nasreen was one of the youngest NHS workers to die from coronavirus at the start of the pandemic. Almost a year on from her death, her sister reveals how Areema's last words changed the course of her life.\nThe last time Kazeema Afzal saw her sister alive, she was getting ready to go on to a ventilator at the hospital where both had worked since they were teenagers.\n\"She waved and said I love you,\" Kazeema recalled of the moment the 36-year-old nurse disappeared behind the double doors.\nBut Areema had one last message to pass on, which she told a colleague moments before she was sedated.\n\"She said, 'my sister... make sure she works hard. I want her to follow in my footsteps',\" Kazeema said. \"That was the last thing she said.\"\nThe two were inseparable growing up in Walsall, West Midlands, together with their younger sister Ash. Areema was only three years older than Kazeema, but \"she was like a mum to us,\" she said. \"Mum knew she could go to another country and Areema would be there to look after us all.\"\nTheir lives mirrored each others'. When Areema and Kazeema were still teenagers, they travelled to Pakistan where their families intended them to marry. \nThey were wed on the same day to two brothers and lived together for six months. \"We grew up quickly,\" Kazeema said. \"We had children very soon after.\" The sisters had three children each and even had the same due date for their youngest child.\nBoth were keen to work. When Areema started as a housekeeper in their home town's Manor Hospital in 2003 aged 19, her younger sister soon followed suit. \nBut it was always the eldest sister's dream to be a nurse. With her husband Fasil Tahseen's support, she became the first member of her family to attend university. In 2019, she became a staff nurse at the hospital that was her \"second home\".\n\"That was her childhood dream,\" said Kazeema, who praised her brother-in-law for helping his wife achieve it. \n\"For an Asian girl to get married and study after.. it's very hard for a partner who has come from another country. But he helped her until the end. He said, 'you do what you want to do'.\"\nNursing suited Areema's warm-hearted and compassionate character.\n\"She got such a buzz out of looking after people,\" her sister said. \"She was always sending money home [to Pakistan]. \"If someone needed water, she'd buy them a pump. She paid for the family of a severely ill child to go on a pilgrimage and she went with them.\"\nUnsurprisingly then, Areema was a popular figure on the acute medical unit (AMU). She had been working there for three months when she began complaining of backache.\nHer family thought it was purely the strain of her house move.\n\"She was never ill,\" Kazeema said. \"When she said she was tired and lethargic, we just thought she'd overdone it. The cough came right at the end.\"\nIt was March 2020 and little was known about many of the symptoms of Covid-19. Areema kept on working, assuming she would turn a corner.\n\"The last shift was the worst ever,\" recalled her sister. \"We told her to go home but she wanted to stay. She was gasping for breath.\"\nWhen she continued to deteriorate, her family sent for an ambulance. A test two days later confirmed their fears. \n\"She sent me a text saying 'I've got Covid' with crying emojis.\" Areema remained in hospital. A few days later, a message came through in the early hours. \n\"My lungs are full,\" it read. She was being sent to ICU.\nKazeema left her home and ran to the hospital just a short distance away.\n\"I fell, I tripped, but I kept on running,\" she said.\nThe two sisters sat together until the 36-year-old was put on the ventilator.\nAt first it looked as though she was improving. But as the pandemic has proved, coronavirus can hit its sufferers in waves and Areema's condition plummeted.\n\"I just got a phone call and they were saying 'I'm so sorry' - and I said, 'what are you trying to say, my sister's dying?'\n\"She died in her husband's arms.\"\nKazeema said she was not surprised by her sister's final words. \"Straight away, I knew she would say that. She was the type of person to put someone else first at the end.\"\nThe two women had discussed many times the younger sibling's hope of following the same career path. But because she did not complete her GCSEs, she never thought she had a hope.\n\"I'd say, 'I can't do it, I'm not that clever', and she'd go 'come on Kaz!'\n\"She kept saying 'trust me, you can do this'.\"\nThe words have stuck in her head ever since. Even though the pain of losing her sister has seriously damaged her mental health, Kazeema has found the strength to become a healthcare assistant - on the very ward where Areema worked.\nAnd this week, she is starting an apprenticeship at Walsall College which will pave the way for her to get a nursing qualification. \n\"I've got my pencil case and my calculator - I was so excited to get them, I was like a schoolgirl picking them up,\" she said.\nWorking on the AMU has been a tonic for Kazeema; with her sister's photographs on the walls, her spirit lives on, not least in the memories of her close-knit colleagues. \nA scholarship has been set up in Areema's memory, to fund a degree in nursing for someone who dreams of a career in healthcare but cannot afford the fees. The first recipient is soon to be announced.\n\"Areema's legacy is going to live on,\" said Kazeema. \"She always wanted to be a nurse and we were all so proud of her. \n\"I want people to be inspired by her - people who don't think they can do something, they can.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "People may need to wear face coverings and socially distance for several years until we return to normality, a leading epidemiologist has predicted.\nMary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at Public Health England, said basic measures could be in place until other countries successfully roll out jabs.\nShe also said a return of big spectator events required careful monitoring and clear instructions about staying safe.\nThe defence secretary has not ruled out the foreign holiday ban being extended.\nBen Wallace told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that booking a break abroad now would be \"premature\" and \"potentially risky\".\nThe UK set another record for the number of coronavirus vaccine doses given in a single day on Saturday, with 844,285 jabs.\nDr Ramsay said restrictions such as face coverings in crowded places and social distancing had become accepted by many and still allowed the economy to function.\nShe said \"people have got used to those lower-level restrictions now, and people can live with them, and the economy can still go on with those less severe restrictions in place\".\n\"So I think certainly for a few years, at least until other parts of the world are as well vaccinated as we are, and the numbers have come down everywhere, that is when we may be able to go very gradually back to a more normal situation,\" she added.\nWarning it was \"very important that we do not relax too quickly\", Dr Ramsay said any circulating virus would inevitably pick on those who are vulnerable. \n\"We have to look very carefully before any of these restrictions are lifted,\" she said.\nProf Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told MPs earlier this month that it was hoped \"simple interventions like washing hands, face masks where appropriate, test-and-trace, and above all vaccines\" would keep the virus controlled beyond the summer.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has also said face masks could be needed in certain situations if the number of infections rises in the winter, but that it was possible people will naturally behave in a way that promotes social distancing.\nA group of government scientific advisers said last month that \"maintaining a baseline of policies which reduce transmission\" will be necessary for some time to come.\nThose experts said these could include continuing test-and-trace, self-isolation, and public messaging that encourages \"voluntary actions to reduce risks\".\nThe government's roadmap for easing lockdown in England states all legal limits on social contact will be removed no earlier than 21 June. \nIn a second release of restrictions on Monday 29 March, people will be able to mix outdoors with up to five others in a return to the so-called \"rule of six\".\nOutdoor sport and leisure facilities can also reopen, organised outdoor sports are allowed once more, and outdoor parent and child groups with up to 15 parents can meet.\nIn Scotland, communal worship resumes on 26 March. In Wales, supermarkets can sell non-essential items from Monday, and garden centres can open. And in Northern Ireland, six people from two households can meet in private gardens from 1 April.\nThe government established a review of measures to control coronavirus from the summer onwards last month.\nMeanwhile, Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute, has told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend there should be a rapid investigation into what happened during the first months of the pandemic.\nHe said he believed there was a \"slowness in political response - almost casual really - suggesting a failure of scientific and medical advice reaching political power\".\n\"We should have a rapid investigation of the first part of the pandemic - January to June - so we can learn the lessons and be bettered prepared for the future,\" he said.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, suggested last week that a public inquiry into the pandemic now would be an unwelcome distraction to those tasked with controlling the virus."

      "text": "Large numbers of police remain on standby in Glasgow as Celtic and Rangers fans were told to stay at home to watch the Old Firm derby.\nAssistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said officers were ready to be deployed to prevent a repeat of celebrations by fans two weeks ago.\nThousands of Rangers supporters broke lockdown rules to gather at Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square.\nPolice Scotland warned there would be arrests if the advice was ignored.\nThe match, which took place behind closed doors at the Celtic Park stadium, ended in a 1-1 draw.\nFans had been told by both police and their own clubs to stay home to avoid putting each other, members of the public and frontline police officers at risk.\nAssistant Chief Constable Higgins told the BBC: \"For the past week we have been heavily engaging with the fans groups - sending out a consistent message to stay at home. The response has indicated this is what they will do.\"\nHe said the potential for fans to gather illegally was there, but that a \"significant policing operation\" was in place to deal with that.\nHe said: \"Hopefully we won't have to deploy the assets we have available.\"\nHe issued a warning: \"If you come out to Celtic Park, George Square, Ibrox Stadium or anywhere else in Glasgow on Sunday, be prepared to be engaged by my officers. We will encourage you to leave and if you don't heed that warning then potentially you are opening yourself up to being arrested.\"\nHe said that the policing of a major event which had no fans formally attending was still new to police, but that plans were based on intelligence from previous matches and certain risk groups.\nOfficers had also worked with both sets of supporters who were asked to \"spread the word\" on the stay-at-home message to their networks and social media followers.\nHe said that there was \"no doubt\" what police wanted fans to do and should they ignore the warnings, plans were in place to deal with that.\nThe Celtic v Rangers league game was at risk of postponement after large numbers of Rangers fans breached Covid lockdown rules.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the scenes as \"disgraceful\" and police said there had been a \"lack of support\" from the club.\nOfficers made 28 arrests following the mass gatherings and also handed out fixed penalty notices for offences including assaulting police officers, sectarian-related breaches of the peace, breaking Covid rules and the use of pyrotechnics.\nIt emerged on Saturday that dozens of police officers had been forced to self-isolate due to some positive Covid cases among officers who policed the incident.\nThe Parkhead league fixture was only given the go-ahead on Friday. \nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the decision to proceed followed \"extensive engagement\" with the clubs, the SPFL, Police Scotland and Glasgow City Council.\nAssistant Chief Constable Higgins said fans should think beyond potential repercussions for the clubs if anything went wrong.\nHe said: \"This isn't about a single game of football. It's not even about the next Old Firm game at Ibrox. It's about not jeopardising and compromising the Scottish government's plan which will see the restrictions gradually lifted. \n\"We don't want a mass outbreak of the disease in Glasgow or the surrounding areas because people have acted irresponsibly which then leads to a review of the route out of lockdown plan.\"\nNational clinical director Jason Leitch told the BBC he was hoping people would do the right thing.\nHe said: \"We have been talking to the clubs for 10 days now, and I have been very impressed with their response. Captains, managers, police, all putting out the same message which is pretty straightforward. \n\"Stay at home, watch the game on the TV and don't go out to celebrate or commiserate. Just stay at home.\""

The man was Karen's son Ken Flanagan.\nRev Billy Davison, from Newtownabbey Methodist Mission, said the community was \"stunned\" by the tragedy.\n\"When things like this happen the community of Rathcoole tend to rally round and offer their support,\" he said.\n\"On behalf of the local community I want to offer sympathy to the bereaved. \n\"We are here and if we can be of any assistance please come along and we will try to help,\" he added.\nA double murder investigation was launched on Saturday, but police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.\nMrs Long said she hopes to put a paper before the NI Executive this week on a strategy to protect women and girls from violence.\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a specific strategy.\nThe justice minister told the BBC NI's Sunday Politics that it is \"an absolute tragedy when we see violence like this occurring and when we see women losing their lives, when we see anyone losing their lives\".\n\"I think it is hugely important at this time that we focus on these issues, it is something that I have made a priority in my time in the justice department,\" she added.\n\"What we need to do, I believe, is move the focus upstream so that we start to tackle why offending behaviours occur so we start to deal with perpetrators.\n\"That's something we do through the criminal justice system, but we'd like to do that earlier, in terms of early intervention.\"\nMrs Long said the issue needed to be tackled across all executive departments.\n\"Not all violence against women and girls is direct violence, it is to do with discrimination and societal attitudes,\" she said.\n\"We need to see progress made, for example, in education. In terms of relationship and sex education, in terms of dispelling rape myths, in terms of dealing with attitudes around victim blaming.\n\"To do that, what we need is a cross-executive strategy and that's what I'm proposing to the executive.\"\nCEO of Women's Aid in Belfast, Kelly Andrews, said \"what we've been doing has not been good enough\" and said a gender neutral strategy was not sufficient.\n\"Seventy percent of domestic abuse victims are female and that really needs to be recognised.\n\"We need to be looking at workplace policies, we also need to focus as well on perpetrators and reducing reoffending.\n\"We need to get men involved in the conversation to call out misogynistic behaviour when they see it as well,\" she added."

      "text": "A new Royal Navy surveillance ship is to be built to protect \"critical\" undersea cables.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace warned \"the lights could go out\" if national infrastructure was lost, and the cables were \"incredibly important\". \nHe also told the BBC's Andrew Marr that Russia had \"taken a deep interest\" in the cables and the UK would be \"deeply exposed\" without further measures.\nIt comes ahead of Monday's publication of the defence command paper.\nThe document will give more detail for the armed forces on the conclusions of the integrated review of the UK's foreign and defence policies.\nBut some parts were already announced this week, including the lifting of the cap on the number of nuclear warheads the UK holds in its stockpile. \nThe government had previously committed to reducing the level to a maximum of 180 by the middle of the 2020s, but the move would allow the number to reach 260. \nMr Wallace said it would ensure the country's nuclear deterrent was \"credible\", and would still be lower than other nations - pointing to France, which has 300.\nBut Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the proposal had \"baffled\" opposition parties and they would not support it until the measure had been justified by the government. \nHundreds of thousands of miles of undersea cables circle the globe, providing internet and communications links between nations and continents.\nThe Ministry of Defence said they are \"vital to the global economy and communications between governments\" and are at \"risk of sabotage\" due to \"submarine warfare\".\nThe new Multi Role Ocean Surveillance ship will be fitted \"with advanced sensors and will carry a number of remotely operated and autonomous undersea drones which will collect data\".\nThe vessel, staffed by 15 people and due to come into service in 2024, will carry out operations in both UK and international waters.\nThe MoD added it will also \"be able to support with other defence tasks, including exercises and operations in the Arctic which will become an increasingly contested area\".\nUndersea cables carry more than 90% of the world's communications - including trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day. \nThere's growing concern these underwater arteries could be vulnerable to attack. \nBritish and US military and intelligence officers have recently warned of Russian submarines \"aggressively operating\" near Atlantic undersea cables. \nThe Ministry of Defence says there's a risk of sabotage - which presents an existential threat to the UK.\nAs part of a wider defence review - the MoD will order a new Royal Navy surveillance ship to monitor  this critical infrastructure. \nMr Wallace told the BBC: \"The lights could go out if we lose our critical national infrastructure across the board. Cables are one part of that critical national infrastructure and incredibly important.\n\"Russia has certainly taken a deep interest in those cables, not only to the United Kingdom but obviously to the continent of Europe. \n\"[The vessel's] job is going to be to protect not only critical national infrastructure, but other things. It will be able to do other surveillance functions around the sea and everything else and I think it is really important that we invest in t hat because otherwise we are deeply exposed.\" \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has promised his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy will help make the UK \"match-fit\".\nThe Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat.\nBroader foreign policy from the review was announced this week, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab pledging to boost alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, describing it as \"increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world\".\nBut more on how the Armed Forces could be overhauled will be announced on Monday, following a boost in funding late last year.\nThe defence secretary was pushed by Andrew Marr on what the new command paper would mean for the size of the forces, but Mr Wallace said that was a decision for Parliament. \nHe added: \"What I can give you is the assurance that we have had a record settlement, so I am making decisions, not in an environment of falling tide like in previous cuts, but in an environment where I am going to make the decision to have the right Armed Forces to match our ambition and meet the threat.\" "
