      "title": "Most Covid rules set to be lifted in Wales on 7 August",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Welsh Parliament,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August.\nThe Welsh government said all laws on the number of people who can meet will end but First Minister Mark Drakeford warned against \"a free for all.\"\nNightclubs would be able to reopen, but face masks will still be required in most indoor public places except in pubs, restaurants and schools.\nSome rules will change on Saturday, meaning six people can to meet in private homes and holiday homes.\nDespite the plan to ease many rules, people will be asked to continue working from home wherever possible.\nMeanwhile, specific social distancing in workplace laws are expected to end from 7 August, with businesses left to decide if they still need to keep customers and workers apart through risk assessments.\nMr Drakeford warned the Senedd that the Delta variant is in every part of Wales and was \"spreading quickly\", with \"real dangers\" that could not be ignored.\nHe told a press conference: \"This is not a free-for-all.\"\n\"There will continue to be some important protections to help keep us all safe, especially those who are clinically vulnerable and who are perhaps the most anxious about an easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Welsh plan to move to its current lowest level of Covid restrictions - known as alert level 0 - on Saturday, 7 August, depends on the country's public health situation. \nIt means there will be more rules in Wales than in England.\nMr Drakeford said while he was \"reasonably confident\" vaccinations had weakened the link between infections and serious illness, with the number of Covid patients in hospital relatively low, there was still \"a risk that this third wave of the pandemic could cause real harm\".\nAlthough the case rate is rising Wales, the country has the lowest infection rate of the UK nations and has one of the world's highest vaccination rates.\nWales will move into the alert level one set of restrictions on Saturday - allowing for six people to meet in private homes and holiday accommodation.\nIce rinks will be able to reopen, and the limits on numbers that can meet in public places or at events outdoors will be removed.\nOutdoor indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing from the same day.\nFully vaccinated people will also no longer need to self-isolate if they are returning from an amber list country from Monday, following decisions taken in England and Scotland.\nBut people returning from an amber list country will need to have a PCR test on day two of their arrival - and cannot visit a hospital or care home within 10 days of returning from abroad.\nMr Drakeford criticised the UK government for having originally introduced the move, only putting it in place in Wales because it would have been \"untenable\" not to.\n\"The risk of re-importation of coronavirus from other parts of the world, and especially further new variants, has not gone away,\" he said.\n\"The removal of a defence against that risk, and especially at a time when the virus is in such rapid circulation, is hard to understand.\"\nUnder plans for alert level zero, ministers have proposed:\nThe face mask rules will remain in place despite the UK government's decision to scrap them in England.\nMinisters are also planning, during August, to allow people who are fully vaccinated not to self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive.\nWhile the specific laws requiring social distancing in workplaces and hospitality are expected to go, the issue will be left for organisations to work out.\nSpecific social distancing laws are expected to be scrapped outdoors this Saturday, and indoors on 7 August.\nThe Welsh government's coronavirus control plan states it will be for organisations to assess the risks, \"depending on the nature of the premises and the risks of exposure\".\nWelsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"Whilst we regret the Welsh Labour government has been the last government in Britain to publish a plan, it is a case of better late than never, and the lifting of restrictions will ensure we can get our economy and public services on the road to recovery.\"\nRhun ap Iorwerth, deputy leader of Plaid Cymru in the Senedd, added: \"The important thing is that Welsh government doesn't follow the ill-judged timetable being set by UK Government in lifting all restrictions during a period of increasing cases.\"\nAccording to the control plan, moving to 7 August will be \"subject to no new variants of concern being identified in Wales, hospital admissions and deaths from Covid-19 remaining at relatively low and manageable levels and if the vaccination programme continues as expected\".\nHospital admissions have risen in the past month but remain significantly lower than earlier in the pandemic.\nCovid rates in Wales stood at 145.3 per 100,000 people on Wednesday, compared to 138.2 the day before.\nThere are 69 patients with confirmed cases of Covid in hospital, compared to 39 a week before. That number is at its highest since mid-April.\n\"The balance of harm is changing,\" says the Welsh government's new Coronavirus control plan, meaning the harms of restrictions are beginning to outweigh the harms of Covid.\nNevertheless, the tone remains laden with caution and an emphasis on collective, as well as personal responsibility.\nWhile Mark Drakeford has rejected the idea of a \"spurious freedom day\", he has also acknowledged that all the home nations are heading broadly in the same direction.\nBut the first minister continues to stress the differences - keeping the requirement for face masks in most indoor settings and obligations on employers to undertake Covid risk assessments.\nThroughout the pandemic, ministers in Cardiff Bay have been convinced that voters want to see a cautious approach and even as we head into what everyone hopes might be the end game, that continues to be the note they want to strike.\n\"It feels like a long time coming,\" said Georgina Heffernan, from Cardiff restaurant The Potted Pig which had to halve its capacity to comply with social distancing.\nHowever, she said some customers may feel \"vulnerable\" if all social distancing measures were eased at once.\n\"We're lucky as a business that we can still implement certain social distancing standards,\" she said.\n\"I think for us that will stay. \n\"Obviously, we do want more customers but we also want the customers we do have to feel as safe as possible.\n\"We do not want to alienate customers who do still feel vulnerable and that don't want to come out into a really busy setting,\" she said.\n\"It has been a struggle. It has been hard on us as a business,\" she said\n\"A lot of people don't see what goes on behind the scenes.\n\"We have gone above and beyond to try and deal with the pandemic and live the pandemic.\"\nIndustry body UK Hospitality Cymru said lifting restrictions in August was \"brilliant\", but warned a more cautious approach in Wales at the height of the holiday season could lead to \"difficulties for customers and staff alike\".\nSara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium warned that caution on returning to offices would likely \"further push back the recovery for city centres and high streets where footfall remains over a quarter lower than pre-pandemic levels\".\n\"Ministers needs to be prepared to consider how best to support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to take longer than anticipated,\" she said.\nCBI Wales called for the Welsh Government \"to provide clear and consistent guidance on safety proposals as soon as possible to give firms time to plan ahead\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said that from 7 August, \"almost all businesses in Wales will be able to trade at capacity due to the easing of social distancing requirements\"."

      "title": "Covid-19: Amber list quarantine for fully vaccinated to end on 19 July",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Department for Transport,Grant Shapps,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully vaccinated UK residents arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine from 19 July.\nHowever, they will still need to pay for Covid tests before and after their return, the transport secretary said.\nGrant Shapps told MPs that under-18s returning from amber list places would also be exempt from quarantine.\nTravel industry leaders said the change was a \"positive step\" but called for the amber list to be expanded.\nCurrently, anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccine status. \nMr Shapps said a full vaccination means \"14 days have passed since your final dose of the vaccine\" - and only vaccines given by the NHS will count. \nBut he said officials were \"working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU\".\nNorthern Ireland plans to adopt the change from 26 July, while both Scotland and Wales have said they will consider whether to follow the same rules.\nUnder the change, fully-jabbed people travelling from amber list countries will still be required to take a test three days before they return and on the second day after they are back - but they will now be exempted from a day eight test.\nMr Shapps told MPs: \"In essence, this means that for fully vaccinated travellers the requirements for green and amber list countries are the same.\"\nHe also said that, from 19 July - the day when most Covid rules in England are due to end - the guidance that people should not travel to amber list countries will be removed.\nBut he cautioned that \"an amber list country could still turn red\", meaning hotel quarantine would become a requirement. \nAll of England's 19 July rule changes are due to be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data.\nFewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK, while more than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel.\nBut most places - including holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. \nThe next review of the countries on the green, red and amber lists will take place on 15 July.\nSpeaking later, the transport secretary told the BBC: \"We had the choice of simply saying people would never be able to travel until every single last person had been vaccinated - or at least starting to open things up.\"\nMr Shapps said testing was \"important to keep people safe\" and prevent variants arriving in the UK, but denied the requirements would continue to price-out many families.\nOn Thursday evening, the government website was listing nearly 400 providers carrying out the tests fully vaccinated travellers would need to take on their return. Prices begin at \u00a32.49, with the majority in the \u00a350-\u00a3100 range.\nThe Foreign Office, which issues travel advice that is independent from the government's traffic light system and could affect travel insurance, is stressing that not all amber countries will be approved for international travel on 19 July. \nHowever, it has updated its approved list and it now has several amber list countries including France, Greece, Morocco, Switzerland, the US, Jamaica and mainland Spain.\nFor the first time in a while, travel bosses are relatively pleased. \nToday's announcement is a big change, opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible this year. However, there are limitations.\nThis policy only applies to those jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if coming from an amber list country. \nThat will affect some family and friends hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors who won't see those customers return in the same numbers as UK travellers will leave.\nTests are still required from green and amber list countries. The cost will dissuade some from travelling.\nCrucially, this rule is just about what happens when people travel to the UK. Whether other countries will let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said the rule change was a \"positive move towards the genuine reopening the sector has been looking for\".\nJohn Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow, welcomed the change but said: \"The UK should open up travel to fully vaccinated people from more countries - particularly our key partners in the US - by the end of July.\"\nHowever, MP Caroline Lucas - vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the government was \"in danger of repeating the same mistakes that allowed the Delta variant to take root in the UK\".\nKatherine Wood, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, will not get a second jab until the end of August and told the BBC the government changes were frustrating for young people who had already sacrificed a \"huge amount\" during the pandemic.\nThe 26-year-old said: \"They should have waited until the vast majority of people, particularly young people, had been double-vaccinated before changing any rules because I really feel quite disenfranchised by what's happened.\"\nThe traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need to check their destination's entry rules.\nFor example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainland Portugal need a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt.\nOnly fully vaccinated adults can travel to Malta, and do not need a negative test. Children aged five to 11 can travel with fully vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-fives don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. \nOver-12s travelling to Spain need a negative test or proof of vaccination. \nUnvaccinated travellers can only enter France for \"essential reasons\", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate.\nEarlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that in addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, the government was considering a \"more proportionate and balanced approach\" to isolation for Covid contacts.\nIt comes amid fears that surging cases will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated.\nThe requirement for double-jabbed people to isolate after contact with a positive case is due to end on 16 August, four weeks after the majority of England's Covid rules are set to end, to allow more people to be vaccinated.\nMr Sunak acknowledged there was \"frustration\" at how the NHS contact tracing app could continue to order the double jabbed to isolate.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, urged people to continue using the app - saying it had helped to detect about 500,000 cases to date - but told the Commons Public Accounts Committee work was being done to \"tune\" it to operate within the vaccinated population so it was there \"for a purpose, not for annoyance\".\nNearly 65% of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose.\nA total of 32,551 new UK coronavirus cases were announced on Thursday - up very slightly on Wednesday and taking the total number of positive tests in the pandemic above five million. There were also 35 more deaths. \nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "tags": "Australia",
      "text": "Australian police have issued a fresh appeal for help to find the remains of Peter Falconio, the British backpacker murdered in the outback 20 years ago.\nThe 28-year-old was shot dead when he and his girlfriend Joanne Lees were ambushed near Alice Springs in 2001. His body was never found.\nAustralian man Bradley Murdoch was found guilty of his murder in 2005.\nDespite pleas, he has refused to tell authorities where he disposed of Mr Falconio's body.\nThe Northern Territory police renewed their search appeal on Wednesday, the 20th anniversary of Mr Falconio's disappearance.\nThey urged \"anyone out there with any information\" to come forward to police to help \"assist Peter's family in gaining some sort of closure\".\n\"We are thinking of Peter's family and friends on this anniversary and remain hopeful that such a milestone may jolt some information and progress the investigation,\" said Det Snr Sergeant Karl Day.\nMurdoch was jailed for a minimum of 28 years after he was convicted of murdering Mr Falconio and assaulting Ms Lees.\nThe attack on the British couple in 2001 remains one of Australia's most high-profile criminal cases in recent decades.\nThe pair had been driving along a remote stretch of highway near Barrow Creek, about 200 miles north of Alice Springs when they were waved down by Murdoch in an approaching car.\nMurdoch then shot Mr Falconio in the head and assaulted and tied up Ms Lees. She managed to escape, and hid in the bushes for five hours while her attacker stalked her with a dog. She eventually managed to flee to safety after flagging down a passing truck.\nMr Falconio's body is believed to have been hidden by Murdoch somewhere in the vast outback. At his trial, the sentencing judge said he believed Murdoch had taken Mr Falconio's body in his car and dumped it somewhere in the vast outback between Alice Springs and Broome, in Western Australia - a distance of 1,600km (994 miles).\nDespite extensive searches and political pressure, police have never found it.\nIn 2016, the Northern Territory government even brought in a \"no body, no parole\" law aimed at pressuring Murdoch to reveal Mr Falconio's whereabouts.\nThe law prevents convicted murderers from becoming eligible for parole if they do not reveal the location of their victims.\nHe has continued to resist helping authorities."

All we're asking is for people to be careful and to think about their behaviour, the amount that they're drinking and just to make sure that doesn't impact on other people and the emergency services.\"\nShe said the volume of calls was affecting the time taken to answer the non-emergency 101 calls - but said about 40% of calls to that number were for other agencies, and not appropriate for the police."

      "tags": "Nissan,Renault,Carlos Ghosn,Car industry",
      "text": "At 10.30pm on a cold December night in 2019, a former titan of the global car industry lay bundled inside a box on board a plane, waiting to flee Japan.\n\"The plane was scheduled to take off at 11pm,\" recalls Carlos Ghosn.\n\"The 30 minutes waiting in the box on the plane, waiting for it to take off, was probably the longest wait I've ever experienced in my life.\"\nNow, for the first time, the man who was once the boss of both Nissan and Renault has detailed his daring escape.\nIn an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Ghosn tells how he disguised himself to slip unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, why a large music equipment box was chosen to smuggle him out of Japan and the elation he felt when he finally landed in his native Lebanon.  \n\"The thrill was that finally, I'm going to be able to tell the story,\" he said.\nMr Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 over allegations by Nissan that he had understated his annual salary and misused company funds, which he denies.\nAt the time, Mr Ghosn was the chairman of the Japanese carmaker. He was also chairman of France's Renault and the boss of a three-way alliance between both carmakers and Mitsubishi.\nHis cost-cutting at Nissan - initially controversial - was ultimately seen to have saved the carmaker and he became a highly respected and recognisable figure. But he insists he was \"collateral damage\" in a fight back from Nissan against the increasing influence of Renault which still owns 43% of the Japanese company. \nDocumentary series Storyville details his extraordinary rise and sudden fall in Carlos Ghosn: The Last Flight which will be shown on BBC 4 on Wednesday 14 July.   \n'Shock, frozen trauma'\nDescribing the moment of his arrest at Toyko airport three years ago, Mr Ghosn said: \"It's like you're being hit by a bus or something really very traumatic happened to you.\n\"The only memory I have of this moment is shock, frozen trauma,\" he said.\nMr Ghosn was taken to the Tokyo Detention Centre where he was given prison clothes and confined to a cell. \"All of a sudden I had to learn to live without the watch, without the computer, without the telephone, without the news, without the pen - nothing,\" he said.\nFor more than a year, Mr Ghosn spent long periods in custody or was held under house arrest in Tokyo after being bailed. It was not clear when a trial would take place - the fear was it could take years - and Mr Ghosn faced a further 15 years in prison if convicted, in a country which has a 99.4% conviction rate.\nIt was during a period of house arrest, when Mr Ghosn was told he would not be allowed to have any contact with his wife, Carole, that he decided to find a way out. \n\"The plan was I could not show my face so I have to be hidden somewhere,\" he said. \"And the only way I could be hidden [was] to be in a box or be in a luggage so nobody could see me, nobody could recognise me and the plan could work.\"\nHe said the idea of using a large box that would normally contain musical instruments \"was the most logical one, particularly that around this time there were a lot of concerts in Japan\". \nBut how would someone once so famous - now infamous - in Japan be able to get from his home in the capital to an airport and make his escape?\nThe plan was, said Mr Ghosn, to behave as normally as possible on the day. \"It should be a normal day where I have a normal walk with normal clothes, normal attitude and all of a sudden, everything change.\"\nMr Ghosn would have to swap the suits he'd worn for years as a high profile executive in the global automotive sector for something a little more casual. Think jeans and trainers.\n\"You can imagine I had to go places where I never been, buy clothes I've never bought,\" he said. \"All of this was part of how do you give yourself a maximum of chance of being successful and absolutely not drawing any attention to yourself.\"\nFrom Tokyo, Mr Ghosn travelled by bullet train to Osaka where a private jet was waiting at the local airport to depart. But first, the box, which was waiting for Mr Ghosn at a nearby hotel.\n\"When you get in the box, you don't think about the past, you don't think about the future, you just think about the moment,\" he said.\n\"You're not afraid, you don't have any emotion except the huge concentration on 'this is your chance, you can't miss it. If you miss it, you're going to pay with your life, with the life of a hostage in Japan'.\" \nMr Ghosn was transported from the hotel to the airport by two men, who were posing as musicians.\nIn all, Mr Ghosn reckons he was in the box for around an hour and a half, though it felt like it lasted \"one year and a half\".\nThe private jet took off on time, and Mr Ghosn - now free from his confines - flew through the night, swapped planes in Turkey before landing in Beirut the next morning.\nLebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan so Mr Ghosn has been allowed to remain there. \nHowever, Americans Michael Taylor and his son, Peter, have since been handed over by the US to Japan and now face three years in prison for helping Mr Ghosn to escape.\nAlso facing jail is Greg Kelly, Mr Ghosn's former colleague at Nissan, who remains under house arrest in Tokyo over allegations he helped his former boss disguise his earnings. Mr Kelly denies the charges.\nWhat of the people who have been left behind in Japan?\nMr Ghosn said: \"I've been told that the end of [Greg Kelly's] trial will be probably by the end of this year. And then God knows what's going to be the results of this trial for, as I said, a bogus reason.\"\nHe added: \"I feel sorry for all the people who are victim of the hostage justice system in Japan, all of them.\" \nPioneer, visionary, ego-maniac, outsider. \nThis part-Lebanese, part-Brazilian citizen of the world is all of these things. \nHe lived more like a head of state than a head of industry. A company party at the Palace of Versailles, coincidentally - he says - on his 60th birthday, saw him hold court with waiting staff dressed in pre-revolutionary garb. \nAs simultaneous head of Renault and Nissan - he was a lightning rod of unease for some at both companies. Those at Nissan feared he would oversee a French coup of the traditional Japanese business he saved. And those at Renault disliked his shunning of the establishment and appearance in the pages of Paris society magazines. \nAny global chief executive has to be sensitive to political nuance. The fact that Carlos Ghosn, after nearly 20 years at Nissan, was totally blindsided by his arrest in Tokyo suggests he had lost touch with the organisations he was trying to bring closer together. \nHis story has everything: hubris, corporate and global politics and an escape-caper worthy of a Hollywood film. He insists he is a man more sinned against than sinning and is working with lawyers to clear his name. \nUntil then, he remains a once-big-fish in a small pond, living in exile and under armed guard in Beirut for the foreseeable future. \nThis is not the ending he was expecting in this extraordinary drama.  \nYou can see the full programme on Storyville Carlos Ghosn: The Last Flight on BBC4 on Wednesday  14 July at 10pm or on the iplayer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nThe move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed.\nMs Sturgeon said \"sensible precautions\" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues.\nShe said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.\nMinisters also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point.\nMs Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate.\nAnd fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival.\nHowever, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place \"for some time\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them.\n\"And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings.\"\nScotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had \"levelled off\", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses.\nShe said \"a gradual approach\" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life.\nNicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said \"I will always err on the side of going more cautiously\". \nEngland is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option \"for good headlines\".\nA statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.\nDespite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned.\nAn obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings.\nWhile laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here \"for as long as necessary\". \nIt feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go.\nThe move to level zero means: \nPlans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers:\nMs Sturgeon said the move was \"not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions\", but it said it \"does restore yet more freedom to all of us\".\nBusiness groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering their plans.\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said firms \"will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nAnd the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives\".\nHe said: \"The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver.\"\nLabour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said \"inconsistent decision making and communications\" was hitting the response to the pandemic.\nHe said: \"The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic.\"\nScottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had \"concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high\", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging.\nAnd outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made \"urgently\", with \"thousands of key workers\" having to quarantine despite testing negative."

      "text": "The government has promised to ban people who abuse footballers online from stadiums for up to 10 years, in the same way as \"violent thugs\".\nBoris Johnson said Football Banning Orders would be amended to allow this and that tech firms would be fined for failing to stop \"vile behaviour\".\nHis comments follow several England players being abused following the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's words rang \"hollow\".\nHe accused Mr Johnson of \"trying to stoke a culture war\" by refusing to condemn football fans who booed players for taking the knee.\nSome Conservative MPs and activists have also expressed unease at the government's stance, with former minister Steve Baker saying the outpouring of support for England's Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho should serve as a \"wake-up\" for the party.\nA 37-year-old man was earlier arrested by Greater Manchester Police over social media posts.\nAn online petition calling for the FA and the government to ban those who have carried out racist abuse to be banned from football grounds for life has attracted more than one million signatures.\nIn a statement, Mr Johnson said: \"I was appalled by the abhorrent abuse directed towards a number of our footballers in the aftermath of Sunday's game. More must be done to prevent people being bullied and trolled online.\"\nNew laws would \"force social media companies to take responsibility and action where this vile behaviour exists\" or face fines, he added.\nMr Johnson also said: \"We are also working closely with the football and police authorities to ensure we can track and take action against online abusers and will ban them from football grounds in the same way we would if they had committed these offences on our streets.\"\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said the England team \"represent the very best of our country\", adding: \"I utterly condemn and abhor the racist outpourings that we saw on Sunday night.\"\nA football banning order is used to prevent someone from attending matches for between three and 10 years.\nIt can be imposed for offences such as throwing missiles on to the playing area or into the crowd, and racist or indecent chanting at a match.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who has been calling for online racists to be banned from matches - said the government had only promised to act because \"they've realised they're on the wrong side, and now they're hoping nobody has noticed\".\nHe accused the PM of \"trying to stoke a culture war\" by refusing \"time and time again - even now - to condemn those who boo our players for standing up against racism\".\nBut the prime minister said: \"Nobody defends booing the England side.\"\nAhead of the Euro 2020 tournament, Mr Johnson declined to condemn England fans who booed players taking the knee, saying fans should \"cheer them on, not boo\".\nHome Secretary Priti Patel described the act as \"gesture politics\". Asked in June if she would criticise fans who booed England players taking the knee, she said: \"That's a choice for them, quite frankly.\"\nOn Monday, she tweeted that she was \"disgusted\" by the online abuse directed at England players.\nEngland footballer Tyrone Mings replied that she had \"stoked the fire\" through her stance on taking the knee. \nSir Keir challenged the prime minister on the home secretary's stance, saying: \"He (Mings) is right, isn't he?\"\nMr Johnson defended the home secretary and said Ms Patel had \"faced racism and prejudice all her career of a kind that he can never imagine\"."

      "text": "John Lewis and Waitrose are planning to cut 1,000 jobs as part of a shake-up of store management.\nThe move follows the closure of eight John Lewis shops earlier this year, which put almost 1,500 jobs at risk.\nJohn Lewis, which owns Waitrose and the department store chain, is trying to cut costs as shopping habits change and more people shop online.\nIt said it would help affected staff find new roles and wanted to avoid compulsory redundancies.\nThe proposed job cuts \"will allow us to reinvest in what matters most to our customers\", a John Lewis Partnership spokesperson said.\nIt will invest in customer service roles and \"visual merchandising to make our shops look their best to entice customers\", the retailer said.\nThe cuts, which work out at nearly three management roles per store, will \"reduce the number of layers between our most senior leaders and non-management\" shop floor staff, it added.\nThe coronavirus pandemic accelerated a trend towards people shopping online instead of in stores.\nLast year the retailer said it would close eight stores with the loss of 1,300 jobs, and put in place a plan to adapt to the boom in online shopping.\nIt then announced a further eight department store closures this year, after the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss.\nEarlier this month, the partnership announced plans to build 10,000 rental homes over the next few years to give it a stable long-term income.\nAt the moment, it has 34 John Lewis shops and 331 Waitrose stores and across the UK. \nIts 80,000 staff are also partners in the business and usually get a share of the profits.\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that for John Lewis, \"pivoting quickly to keep up with the accelerated shift in shopping habits brought on by the pandemic has been far from easy\".\nLast year was the first time since 1953 that the company did not pay a bonus, \"highlighting the once-in-a-generation challenge the partnership is facing\", she said.\nThe firm is spending \u00a31bn over five years to speed up the move to online sales.\n\"To do that, it needs to make significant cost savings elsewhere,\" Ms Streeter said. \"Closing underperforming stores and reducing headcount is an inevitable consequence as chair Dame Sharon White tries to steer the ship towards the online shopping future.\"\nShe added: \"It's becoming increasingly clear that John Lewis faces a future with a much smaller retail footprint. \n\"By evolving to become part of campus-style developments [with housing], the partnership may help distressed city centres find new leases of life and bring fresh energy back into the retail ecosystem.\""

      "title": "Price rises speed up again as economy unlocks",
      "tags": "Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK inflation rate hit 2.5% in the year to June, the highest for nearly three years, as the unlocking of the UK economy continued.\nThe Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 2.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics said, driven by higher food and fuel costs.\nThe rate is higher than the Bank of England's 2% inflation target for a second month. \nThat will fuel the debate about whether interest rates need to go up.\nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nAs well as food from shops, eating and drinking out also cost more, while clothing and footwear, usually cheaper at this time of year, went up in price instead.\nSecond-hand car prices rose between May and June this year, whereas in recent years, they have fallen between these months, the ONS said.\nSome buyers were reported to have turned to the used car market as a result of delays in the supply of new cars caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production.\nJune's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.2%.\nONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: \"The rise was widespread, for example coming from price increases for food and for second-hand cars, where there are reports of increased demand.  \n\"Some of the increase is from temporary effects, for example, rising fuel prices which continue to increase inflation, but much of this is due to prices recovering from lows earlier in the pandemic. \n\"An increase in prices for clothing and footwear, compared with the normal seasonal pattern of summer sales, also added to the upward pressure this month.\"\nRetail Prices Index (RPI) inflation, an older measure that is still used to calculate certain cost-of-living increases, rose to 3.9% in June, from 3.3% in May.\nThe latest rise in the inflation rate will add to pressure on the Bank of England to consider increasing interest rates to cool the economy.\nThe Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has taken the view that the current inflation surge is \"transitory\" and will fall back after peaking at 3%.\nBut the Bank's departing chief economist, Andy Haldane, warned last month that the risk of high inflation was \"rising fast\" and could reach nearly 4% this year.\nInflation is up again, above target, with prices rising faster than expected across the board in June. Much of this is the result of comparisons with prices that were falling a year ago at the height of the lockdown. Bottlenecks in supply are also driving prices up. For example, car producers can not find microchips, so cannot build enough new cars, so used car prices went up 4.4% in a month. During the pandemic, the microchip market diverted its supply to electronics amid a slump in car sales. \nThere are plenty of examples like this, and the net result is that inflation is heading above 3% in the coming months. This is sufficiently above target to trigger a letter of explanation from the governor of the Bank of England to the chancellor, but don't expect immediate rises in interest rates. \nInflation should peak at this level before falling back to normal, as the economy further reopens. It is, right now, high and rising, but hardly out of control. And the reasons for this global rise are pretty clear: demand rebounding quickly after the pandemic, while supply is taking a little longer to ramp back up.\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sided with the MPC majority view that inflation was likely to reach 3%, but not much higher.\nInterest rates would therefore remain at the current record low of 0.1% \"throughout next year\", he said.\nInflation would \"ease quickly in 2022\", returning to the Bank's 2% target \"in the second half of next year\", he forecast.\nHowever, Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, took Mr Haldane's view that inflation could peak as high as 4% at the end of this year.\n\"We expect it to continue its upward trend over the summer,\" she told the BBC. \"That's largely because of these global supply shortages which have become more acute.\n\"Of course, that's affected everything from semi-conductors to household appliances.\"\nTraders in Willesden Market in north-west London interviewed by the BBC said they were feeling the effects of those supply shortages, with their wholesale costs going up sharply.\nHowever, they added that they were finding it difficult to pass on those costs to their customers, who were unwilling or unable to pay more.\nOne trader said: \"If you try to pass the costs on to the customers, they just don't buy it. Especially at the moment. \n\"No-one's got any money, everyone's skint, everyone's coming back out of lockdown, people have lost their jobs. \n\"I'm earning less, but I'm still going, so I can be thankful for that at the moment.\""

      "text": "Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formentera are being moved onto the government's amber travel list for England.\nThe Balearic Islands will join the list from 04:00 BST on Monday, 15 days after they were moved to the green watchlist.\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments said they will do the same, and Northern Ireland is expected to follow suit.\nFrom Monday, only people aged over 18 who are not fully vaccinated will still have to quarantine on returning from an amber list country.\nThe requirement to self-isolate is being scrapped for the fully vaccinated and under-18s from Monday in England, Scotland and Wales but travellers in Northern Ireland will have to wait another week before the rule change.\nThe British Virgin Islands are also moving to the amber list, while Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sierra Leone will be moved to the strictest red list. \nBulgaria and Hong Kong will move to the green list, while Croatia and Taiwan join the green watchlist, which means they are at risk of being moved to amber.  \nIt is understood that data indicates a big rise in cases in the Balearic Islands following end-of-term parties.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said case rates had doubled since the islands were added to the green watchlist, which meant the government needed to \"move quickly\". \nHe also warned that people travelling abroad this summer will need to make sure they can get their money back or rebook their accommodation, adding that \"no-one can be out there thinking we can travel and just rely on things not changing\".\nBut package holiday firm Tui said the \"continued lack of transparency\" about the methodology and data behind the changes was making it \"incredibly difficult for customers to book far in advance with confidence\".\nEasyJet said it could not understand why people were going to be allowed to attend nightclubs from Monday without a mask or social distancing but the government was \"not comfortable with people going to the beaches of Europe where the infection rates are lower than in the UK\".\nVirgin Atlantic called for the government to \"act decisively\" and add nations with high vaccination rates, such as the US, to the green list at the next review. \nLabour criticised the government for not publishing the country-by-country data that informs its traffic light system. \nShadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: \"People are booking holidays in good faith and now face the prospect of losing out because ministers refuse to be straight with the public.\" \nMedi Jones Williams, from Bristol, booked a holiday to Majorca on Friday and said she still planned to fly there on Saturday for her seven-day trip.\nThe 25-year-old had her first vaccine three weeks ago, and is now looking to get a second dose as soon as possible.\nShe told the BBC: \"I'm still going to go because I'm sick of everything. I feel like if I don't it will never happen because things keep changing. \n\"I do understand why they have to vaccinate older people first but when they got to 40 they should have vaccinated everyone.\n\"It doesn't make sense to open on Monday when not everyone is vaccinated.\"  \nMr Shapps defended the government's traffic light system, saying that the categories mean \"people can see, broadly-speaking, where these countries are classified\".\nHe added: \"We're not in control of this virus, particularly in how it affects other counties, their levels of vaccinations, their level of genomic sequencing, their testing regimes.\"\nTravelling to green list destinations was likely to be a \"better bet\" than those on the green watchlist, he said, but cautioned \"there are no guarantees\".\nHe urged people to come forward and get both vaccine doses to give them \"one more piece of security when you do go off to travel\".\nThe changes will come as bad news for travellers who are over 18 and not yet double vaccinated.\nThe government says they can still pay for additional tests on day five as part of test-to-release and are advising everyone to get their jabs as quickly as possible. \nUnder the change to amber list travel rules, announced last week, fully-jabbed people will still be required to take a test three days before they return and on the second day after they are back - but they will now be exempted from a day eight test.\nFrom Monday - when most Covid rules in England end - the guidance that people should not travel to amber list countries will be removed.\nFewer than 30 destinations are on the green list, which do not require people to quarantine on their return. \nMore than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel.\nBut most places - including holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. \nGreen watchlist countries do not require arrivals to quarantine but are at risk of being moved to amber. \nMeanwhile, more than two thirds of adults in the UK - some 35 million people - have now received both vaccine doses, the government announced on Wednesday. \nThe government said it meant it had hit its target of vaccinating two thirds of adults by 19 July early. \nSome 46,037,090 people have received a first dose while 35,155,767 have had both doses - the equivalent of  87.4% and 66.7% of the adult population respectively.  \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described the milestone as \"another extraordinary achievement\", adding that it was enabling the UK to \"cautiously ease restrictions next week and return closer towards normal life\".  \nOn Wednesday, the UK recorded another 42,302 cases and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the daily government figures. \nAre you a holidaymaker or a travel agent?

      "tags": "Voting rights in the United States,US election 2020,Donald Trump,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The battle over voting rights in the US is a drama that's playing out in the Congress and state legislatures across the country.\nIn Philadelphia on Tuesday, Joe Biden gave a fiery speech, warning that American democracy is facing its greatest threat since the Civil War.\n\"There's an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote and fair and free elections,\" the president said.\nBiden condemned recent efforts in 17 Republican-controlled states to pass laws curtailing when and where their citizens can vote - laws conservatives have framed as a response to allegations of voting fraud repeatedly made by Donald Trump in the months after his presidential defeat.\nMany Republicans now believe the election was stolen from Trump - an assertion Biden called \"the big lie\" and one that has not been substantiated by concrete evidence.\nMeanwhile, in Texas the fight over voting changes has led to drastic measures, as Democratic legislators have temporarily blocked passage of voting legislation by flying to Washington, DC. There, they are pressuring congressional Democrats to enact new federal rules for conducting elections that would supersede any state actions.\nAt the centre of this national debate is a question of what is the greatest threat to American democracy. Is it the security of an election process that in 2020 relied heavily on early and mail-in voting?\nOr is it a system, corrupted by the influence of big donors and powerful interests, that makes voting more difficult than necessary, particularly for historically disadvantaged groups?\nThe Democratic effort at a national voting law centres around passage of the \"For the People Act\". It represents one of the most expansive federal reforms of the US election system in a generation.\nThe bill would guarantee that voters can receive a mail-in ballot if requested, mandate a minimum of 15 days of early voting before every federal election, require paper ballots and set standards for voting machines.\nIt would prohibit states from disenfranchising felons who have completed their sentences and enact new restrictions on undisclosed so-called \"dark money\" political contributions.\nMany new voters would be automatically registered under the legislation, which also requires technology companies to disclose information about political advertising, create new government support for small donor-funded candidates and seek to end the practice of \"gerrymandering\" voting maps for partisan advantage.\nIn March the US House of Representatives approved the bill by a nearly party line vote, with one Democrat - Bennie Thompson of Mississippi - opposing because of concerns that the redistricting provision would disadvantage black voters.\nThree months later, Republicans in the US Senate blocked passage of the For the People Act by use of the filibuster, a parliamentary procedure that requires 60 votes to pass major legislation. The bill only received 50 votes - all from Democrats in the evenly divided 100-seat chamber.\nDemocrats have since turned their focus to updating the Voting Rights Act, a 1960s-era law that has been curtailed by the US Supreme Court over the past decade.\nAs evidenced by the two congressional votes, Republican opposition to the Democratic legislation has been near complete.\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the bill an \"unparalleled political grab\" that would consolidate Democratic power.\n\"What this is really about is an effort for the federal government to take over the way we conduct elections in this country,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly before his chamber blocked the bill. \"It is a solution in search of a problem.\"\nFormer Vice-President Mike Pence, in one of his first public statements since being forced to evacuate the US Capitol after it was attacked by pro-Trump rioters, wrote in an opinion column that the Democratic proposal would \"increase opportunities for election fraud, trample the First Amendment, further erode confidence in our elections and forever dilute the votes of legally qualified eligible voters\".\nBehind the Democratic urgency in Congress to pass voting reforms is the reality that they're in a race with dozens of state legislatures enacting measures that curtail the same voting processes and systems that the For the People Act seeks to mandate.\nGeorgia, for instance, passed a law curtailing the use of drop boxes for ballot returns, requiring photo identification to vote by mail, and making it illegal to provide food and water to people waiting in line to vote.\nThe move prompted protests and boycotts of the state, including the decision to move the Major League Baseball's July All-Star game from Atlanta to Denver, Colorado.\nOther key political battlegrounds, including Florida, Arizona and Iowa, have enacted similar legislation.\nIn Texas, Democrats in the legislature left the state in July to deny Republicans a quorum and at least temporarily prevent passage of new voting measures that would limit mail-in balloting and curtail in-person voting hours and locations.\nRepublicans frame their laws as common-sense measures to protect against fraud and ensure that Americans have faith in the electoral process. Democrats counter that the confidence of the public has been damaged by the unsubstantiated allegations made by Trump and others after November's balloting.\nWhen it comes to a showdown between states and federal government over the rules of the election game, the US Constitution says the latter wins. That won't prevent a spate of lawsuits challenging the legality of the federal legislation if the congressional Democrats succeed in getting their bill passed by the Senate.\nJust last month, the Supreme Court upheld an Arizona ban on the collection of mail-in ballots by third parties - an issue that would be directly addressed by the For the People Act.\nWashington is no stranger to high-stakes political battles. Most sessions of Congress, particularly early in a new presidential administration, feature more than a few legislative showdowns touted for their potential long-term implications.\nThis one is a fight over how elections are conducted and - consequently - who is around to participate in all the other political battles to come.\nThe stakes don't get much higher than that."

      "text": "The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has used parliamentary privilege to identify a former soldier facing two murder charges over his actions on Bloody Sunday.\nThe Foyle MP named Soldier F during a debate in the House of Commons on the Armed Forces Bill on Tuesday afternoon. \nThe soldier is also facing five attempted murder charges.\nHe had been granted anonymity by the judge hearing the case. \nThe BBC is not naming Soldier F for legal reasons.\nThe ancient right of parliamentary privilege gives MPs unrestricted free speech in the Commons chamber allowing them to name names without the risk of legal action. \nColum Eastwood used that right of privilege to name Soldier F. \nAfter naming him, the Foyle MP said: \"For 50 years he has been granted anonymity and now the government want to grant him an amnesty. \n\"No one involved in murder during the Troubles should be granted an amnesty.\"\nSpeaking outside parliament, Mr Eastwood told the BBC: \"Over the past couple of weeks his name has been plastered on Free Derry Corner, it has gone viral on social media.\n\"The people of Derry know his name. There is no reason for him to be granted anonymity. \n\"No other perpetrator involved would be given anonymity, for some reason Soldier F is a protected species.\"\nSoldier F is facing two murder charges over the killings of William McKinney and James Wray and five attempted murder charges for his actions on Bloody Sunday in 1972 when 13 people were shot dead by paratroopers.\nHe was granted anonymity after the judge hearing the case concluded \"a real risk does exist\" to the life of Soldier F and he is right to \"feel genuine fear\".\nBut the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said it planned to withdraw the charges after reviewing the case and decided statements were no longer admissible evidence.\nThe case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but a legal challenge by a brother of William McKinney forced an adjournment. \nLeave has been granted for a judicial review into the PPS's decision not to proceed with the prosecution.  \nThe case is due to be heard in September. \nGregory Campbell from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) described Mr Eastwood's decision to identify Soldier F as \"reckless and downright dangerous\".\n\"I will be writing to the Speaker and the Commissioner for Standards. The Foyle MP's behaviour falls well below that expected of someone in his position, especially when the courts have made clear that to name this person could jeopardise life,\" the DUP MP said. \nMr Campbell, who represents the East Londonderry constituency, added: \"The DUP does not believe in an amnesty for anyone who perpetrated wrongful actions. \n\"Far too many terrorists have already been released early. Everyone must be equal under the law.\"\nFormer veterans' minister Johnny Mercer also said Mr Eastwood should be sanctioned for his \"unnecessary and dangerous\" move.\nIn a social media post he accused Mr Eastwood of \"mis-using parliamentary privilege\".\n\"I have never defended this man, but I will defend his right to a fair process,\" Mr Mercer said."

      "tags": "Cyber-crime,Cyber-attacks,Cyber-security",
      "text": "Websites for a Russian-linked ransomware gang blamed for attacks on hundreds of businesses worldwide have gone offline.\nMonitors say a payment website and a blog run by the REvil group became suddenly unreachable on Tuesday.\nThe reason behind the disappearance is unknown, but has sparked speculation that the group may have been targeted deliberately by authorities. \nIt comes amid growing pressure between the US and Russia over cyber-crime. \nUS President Joe Biden said he raised the issue with Vladimir Putin during a phone call on Friday, after discussing the subject during a summit with the Russian president in Geneva last month.\nMr Biden told reporters that he had \"made it very clear to him...we expect them to act\" on information and also hinted the US could take direct digital retaliation on servers used for intrusions. \nThe timing of Tuesday's outage has sparked speculation that either the US or Russian officials may have taken action against REvil - though officials have so far declined to comment and cyber experts say sudden disappearances of groups are not necessarily uncommon.\nThe development comes after a series of high-profile ransomware attacks which have hit major US businesses this year.\nThe FBI accused REvil - also known as Sodinokibi - of being behind a ransomware attack on the world's largest meat processing company JBS last month. \nThe group is considered prolific and last week demanded a huge bitcoin ransom for an attack which targeted IT firm Kaseya and hundreds more businesses worldwide.  \nREvil is one of the most prolific and feared of all ransomware gangs and if this really is the end, it's extremely significant.\nThe rumour mill is in hyperdrive about what's behind this sudden shutdown but one hacker who claims to be an affiliate of the gang gave me some insights. I'm yet to confirm his identity but other researchers say his claims are highly plausible.\nHe claims that the US \"Feds took down\" elements of their websites and so they pulled the plug on the rest of their operation. He also said there was pressure from the Kremlin too saying: \"Russia is tired of the US and other countries crying to them.\" \nLike all hacker claims we have to take them with a large dollop of salt but if this scenario proves to be accurate, it shows a dramatic shift in policy from Russia which has so far been happy to sit back and let gangs like REvil operate without fear of intervention. \nHowever another comment from my contact also hints at the bigger picture. He says he has no plans to retire and is already planning another unknown venture. \"Make one go away, more will rise,\" he warned. "

[to secure] the wellbeing of not only our generation, but of our children and grandchildren. Europe is ready to lead the way.\"\nThe measures are likely to push up household heating bills, as well as increase the cost of flights in the EU. Financial assistance will be available for people to install insulation and make other long-term changes to their homes.\n\"We're going to ask a lot of our citizens,\" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said. \"We're also going to ask a lot of our industries, but we do it for good cause. We do it to give humanity a fighting chance.\"\nOpposition is also expected from some industry leaders, such as airlines and vehicle manufacturers, as well as from eastern member states that rely heavily on coal.\nOne EU diplomat told Reuters that the success of the package would rest on its ability to be realistic and socially fair, while also not destabilising the economy.\n\"The aim is to put the economy on a new level, not to stop it,\" they said.  \nThe measures, billed as the EU's most ambitious plan yet to tackle climate change, have been named the Fit for 55 package because they would put the bloc on track to meet its 2030 goal of reducing emissions by 55% from 1990 levels.\nBy 2019, the EU had cut its emissions by 24% from 1990 levels.\nSome of the key proposals include:\nBut corporate lobby BusinessEurope denounced the plan, saying it \"risks destabilising the investment outlook\" for sectors such as steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electric power \"enormously\".\nAnd Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said: \"Aviation is committed to decarbonisation as a global industry. We don't need persuading, or punitive measures like taxes to motivate change.\"\nAt the same time, environmentalist campaigners have said the proposals don't go far enough.\n\"Celebrating these policies is like a high-jumper claiming a medal for running under the bar,\" Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss said in a statement.\n\"This whole package is based on a target that is too low, doesn't stand up to science, and won't stop the destruction of our planet's life-support systems.\"\nClimate campaigner Greta Thunberg said that unless the EU \"tears up\" its proposals, \"the world will not stand a chance of staying below 1.5C of global heating\".\nIn September the EU Commission set out its blueprint for reaching the 55% reduction by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures.\nThe targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\nThe Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change.\nThe scale of this 12-pronged plan is breathtaking. It will likely have an impact on every citizen of Europe in almost every aspect of their lives.\nThe scope is so huge because the target is so tough. \nFrom 1990 to 2019 the EU cut carbon emissions by 24% - now it proposes to slash CO2 by another 31% in just 9 years. That's what's needed if the 2050 net-zero target is to be achieved. \nSo as well as boosting renewables, the EU is now set to tackle the really tough issues of home heating and transport. The proposals would see the end to new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. \nEurope's emissions trading scheme will also be reformed to include heating and road transportation. Fossil fuels used in shipping and aviation will face tax rises.\nOne of the most eye-catching proposals is a carbon border tax on goods like steel, cement and fertiliser to ensure that European industry, which has to pay for permits to use carbon, can compete. However, the proposal is contentious and could spark a trade war with China and the US.\nThe ambitious package will now face months of negotiations with member states, with poorer countries wary of new policies that could raise costs for consumers.\nThe commission is betting that instead of hordes of yellow-vest protesters taking to the streets, citizens will be willing to pay a price for cleaner air, lower emissions, and more sustainable lifestyles. \nThe rest of the world will watch this huge gamble with interest.

      "text": "Wales should now lift all Covid restrictions, a leading expert on infectious diseases has said. \nThe success of vaccinations and immunity levels meant it was safe to end lockdown, said Welsh and UK government advisor Prof John Watkins.\nHe said the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths had \"definitely\" been broken.\nSenior Welsh officials have said while the link is weaker, it has not been eradicated.\nThere are also concerns young people are not coming forward for vaccines as the rollout continues. \nOn Monday Boris Johnson announced almost all legal Covid-19 restrictions would end in England on 19 July, meaning those across the border will no longer be required by law to social distance or wear face masks.\nWelsh ministers will announce any changes to Covid rules in Wales at their next review on Wednesday.\nDr Ami Jones, a critical care consultant at the Aneurin Bevan health board, said the changes in England were a \"slap in the face for the whole population\" as case rates continued to rise.\n\"I think most healthcare providers will not be throwing their masks in the bin, and going to crowded places\u2026 because we know what's coming,\" she said.\nLatest data from Public Health Wales shows the Covid case rate in Wales is 136.1 per 100,000 people - below other UK nations and all English regions.\nOn Monday, 1,190 new cases were announced, taking the total since the start of the pandemic to 225,691. \nThe number of people admitted to hospital with Covid remains close to record low levels, with the number of those in critical care also very low.\nConsultant epidemiologist Prof Watkins, of Cardiff University, said vaccinations had been extremely effective in preventing serious illness, including against the Delta variant.\n\"We've got a considerable amount of the adult population now vaccinated and we know that vaccination reduces transmission as well as reduces adverse events,\" he said.\n\"And we know that in young people, where the bulk of infections are occurring at the moment, that actually they have got far less chances of adverse events, so I think we're at a reasonably good place to start opening up society.\nDespite a recent rise in the number of cases, Prof Watkins said the latest health modelling suggested Wales was following a \"positive trajectory\".\n\"It's always going to be a balance of risk, and I think we've protected the most vulnerable to this virus, and we've got good evidence that a significant proportion of the UK population has been exposed to the virus, or has antibodies to the virus... so actually we have a population that is reasonably well protected,\" he said.\nHe added: \"There comes a point where we have to start living with the viral transmission, and I think now is the time to do that.\"\nProf Watkins added: \"In Wales, the numbers of deaths from people testing positive for the last 28 days have been no more than one or two a day, and many days without any [deaths] at all. Our hospitals are in a good place in terms of cases.\n\"Over the next couple of weeks, as we start to open up and this current surge of cases passes through, we'll see whether we're on the right course - but all the data suggests that we are.\"\nAlmost 92% of adults in Wales - including two-thirds of young people under 25 - now have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates.\nDr Watkins said the concept of herd immunity should not be discounted as a \"dirty word\", adding: \"once you've got a certain level of protection within the population, the virus doesn't have very many places to go.\"\nDr Jones said she feared what might happen if Welsh ministers did not act cautiously.\n\"I'm worried about how the next few weeks are going to go, if the restrictions do lift\u2026 it's going to be a Delta Covid fiesta, it's going to spread like wildfire,\" she said.\n\"Who knows what that's going to mean for the hospitals, which ultimately is going to impact on hundreds of thousands of people lives.\"\nWelsh government Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan has already said the country is going to have to \"learn to live with\" coronavirus as ministers consider their next move.\nSenior advisers did not say how ministers may relax decide to relax restrictions when they took a Welsh government Covid briefing on Monday.\nBut they reiterated their view that the link between cases and serious illness was weaker, but had not gone completely.\nDeputy chief medical officer for vaccines Dr Gill Richardson said: \"We can confidently say that vaccines have weakened the link between infections, serious illness and hospitalisations and deaths.\n\"But they have not broken the link.\"\nDr Richardson told the press conference hospital admissions were not at the same levels as they were during the winter.\nBut she added: \"We can expect hospital admissions to rise, especially among young people, or the unvaccinated and those who haven't completed their course.\"\nChief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said he did not know if there would ever be a point where the link between cases and serious illness was \"completely broken\".\nHe said cases were doubling approximately every six-and-a-half days, with every person who is infected \"going on to infect almost another two people\".\nHe added that in this third wave of the epidemic, there were far fewer infections in the older age groups.\nDr Richardson was also concerned that some younger adults were not coming forward for vaccination. \nFor those aged 18 to 39, 26% have not yet taken up a first dose - nearly 234,500 people.\n\"One in four in this age group are still not protected,\" Dr Richardson said.\n\"These young adults are vulnerable to infection, serious illness and life-changing long Covid, as well as loss of earnings if they have to self-isolate as cases of the Delta variant are increasing in this age group.\" \nShe added: \"Health boards are running walk-in Pfizer clinics to make it as easy as possible for this age group to get vaccinated.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Long Covid,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble.\nOne expert likens what is being done to taking the \"control rods out of a nuclear reactor\".\n\"This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,\" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson.\nAnd that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. \nThis is our first \"natural wave\" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. \nThe move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread.\nBut with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks.\nSome have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise.\nAnd, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating.\nBut that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered.\nThis has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. \nThe reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months.\nThe results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions.\nIt is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public \"going slowly\" in the way they embrace new freedoms.\nProf Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. \"If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,\" he said.\nBut this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.)\nAnd if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. \nWill 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire?\n\"We would get through it as we have before,\" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. \"But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments.\"\nAnother consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. \nBut, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where \"big waves\" may be in the past.\nThis does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever.\nInstead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one.\nThis will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. \nAfter all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 - there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak.\nWill we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick\nAre you still shielding and are concerned that restrictions are lifting in England?

      "text": "MPs have approved compulsory vaccinations for care home staff in England, but a number of Conservatives rebels voiced anger at the plans.\nFrom October, anyone working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England must have two vaccine doses unless they have a medical exemption. \nThe House of Commons approved the regulations by 319 votes to 246.\nBut Tory MPs criticised the government for not publishing an impact assessment of the policy before the vote.\nHealth minister Helen Whately told MPs the \"impact assessment is being worked on\".\nAlmost 30,000 more care home residents in England and Wales died during the coronavirus outbreak than during the same period in 2019, ONS figures released this month showed.\nMinisters have previously expressed concern about the low take-up of the vaccine among some care home staff. \nConservative former minister Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said: \"If there's uncertainty, share the uncertainty with the House.\n\"It isn't good enough to expect us to vote on something that is difficult and controversial and complicated, and not share the information with the House that the minister has at her disposal. It is an abuse. It's not good enough.\"\nConservative MP William Wragg said he was \"in despair\", adding: \"The government is treating this House with utter contempt. Ninety minutes on a statutory instrument to fundamentally change the balance of human rights in this country is nothing short of a disgrace.\"\nMr Wragg went on to raise the case of a care worker who fears losing her job as a result of the policy, asking: \"Is that what we're prepared to do to our fellow citizens as a Conservative government?\nLabour's Rachael Maskell added: \"We're having to make a decision in the House this evening on the balance of risk and therefore we haven't been given the data because the impact assessment hasn't come forward.\"\nDeputy Speaker Nigel Evans said it was a \"totally unsatisfactory\" situation and he would raise the issue with the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\nCare minister Ms Whately said guidance would be forthcoming, but suggested managers could discuss the vaccine with staff or look at an alternative role for those who did not want to be vaccinated.\nBut she acknowledged there were not \"that many roles\" that did not involve being in the care home. \nShe said in that situation, if a staff member did not want to be vaccinated, then a notice period could follow with a \"fair process\".\nCare organisations have previously warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people.\nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was \"a blunt instrument that carries its own risks\".\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff.\nThe move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care, launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nAt the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported a further 36,660 cases and 50 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.

      "text": "A Chinese man has been reunited with his son after a 24-year search that saw him travel over 500,000km (310,000 mi) on a motorbike across the country.\nGuo Gangtang's son had been snatched aged two by human traffickers in front of their home in the province of Shandong.\nHis son's disappearance actually inspired a movie in 2015, which starred Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau.\nChild abductions are a big problem in China, with thousands taken every year.\nAccording to China's Ministry of Public Security, the police were able to trace the son's identity using DNA testing. Two suspects were later tracked down and arrested, said a Global Times report. \nThe suspects, who were dating at the time, had planned to kidnap a child with the intention of selling him for money, said a report by China News. \nAfter spotting Mr Guo's son playing alone outside his home, the female suspect identified only by her surname Tang grabbed him and took him to the bus station, where her partner, named as Hu, was waiting. \nThe couple then took an intercity coach to neighbouring Henan province and sold the child there.\nLocal media reports say Mr Guo's son was found still living in the province. \nMr Guo and his wife cried and hugged their son when they were reunited in Liaocheng, Shandong, on Sunday, state media CCTV reported.\n\"My baby, you came back!\" said the mother, whose name was not released, in a video of the reunion.\n\"Now that the child has been found, everything can only be happy from now on,\" Mr Guo told reporters.\nMr Lau, who got to know Mr Guo while preparing to play him in the film Lost and Love, congratulated him. \n\"I'd like to say to Brother Guo that I admire your persistence,\" he said, according to the South China Morning Post.\nAfter his son was abducted in 1997, Mr Guo reportedly travelled to more than 20 provinces around the country on the back of a motorbike chasing tip-offs. \nIn the process, he broke bones in traffic accidents and even encountered highway robbers. Ten motorbikes were also damaged.\nCarrying around banners with his son's picture on them, he is said to have spent his life savings on his mission, sleeping under bridges and begging for money when he ran out of cash.\nHe also became a prominent member of missing-persons organisations in China, and helped at least seven other parents reunite with their abducted children.\nIn China, the abduction and trafficking of babies has been a problem for decades. \nIn 2015, it was estimated that 20,000 children were being abducted each year in China. Many of them are sold into adoption, both domestically and overseas.\nChild trafficking has been an enormous social problem in China with tens of thousands of unsolved cases remaining.\nIt appears to be so widespread that a few years ago, when the police introduced a phone app to report crime, \"child abduction\" had its own front-page category along with the likes of theft, drug dealing and murder.\nIt has clearly caused massive pain in the community, not the least of which because - in some cases - there appear to have been \"insiders\" like relatives or village neighbours who have assisted in the abductions.\nIn one particularly distressing example, children were kidnapped and made to work in a brick factory in a neighbouring province.\nThis year's big DNA drive by the police seems to be working in terms of finding some of those taken quite a while ago. But it would be hard to solve more recent cases in this way because the strategy relies on people coming forward for blood tests and children (who may not even know they had been abducted and sold to their current parents) are hardly going to be presenting themselves for blood tests.\nEither way, given the bleak nature of the situation and the desperate sadness of many who've lost their children, seeing Guo Gangtang reunited with his son after decades of perseverance has been both heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time."

      "tags": "Transport,COP26,Climate change,Environment,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "You can carry on flying, the government has told the British public, as it outlines its plan to reduce transport emissions to virtually zero by 2050.\nMinisters say new technology will allow domestic flights to be almost emissions-free by 2040, and international aviation to be near zero-carbon by mid-century.\nThe policy has been ridiculed by environmentalists, who say the government is putting far too much faith in innovation.\nThey say demand for flying and driving must be curbed if the UK is to meet its ambitious climate targets.\nThe comments on aviation form part of the government\u2019s Transport Decarbonisation Strategy, announced on Wednesday.\nTransport is responsible for 27% of the UK's emissions, making it the single biggest emitting sector. Before the pandemic, flying made up about 7% of overall emissions. \nThe government has pledged the entire economy will be virtually zero-carbon by mid-century and is relying on new technology to play a significant role in achieving that, especially in aviation. \n\"It's not about stopping people doing things: it's about doing the same things differently,\" said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\n\"We will still fly on holiday, but in more efficient aircraft, using sustainable fuel. We will still drive, but increasingly in zero-emission cars.\"\nHe told the BBC's Today Programme that progress towards low-carbon flying was further advanced than people realised.\n\"We already have electric aircraft, going up in the air, and in fact the UK has become the first country in the world to have a hydrogen aircraft flying as well,\" he said.\n\"In addition to those advanced technologies, we also have things like sustainable aviation fuel.\"\nMr Shapps said the government planned to use sustainable fuel to fly home some participants in November's COP26 conference.\nHowever, critics say reductions in emissions will not be achievable without reducing the amount we fly.\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas described the government's approach to aviation as \"a flight of fantasy\" that relied on technology that was still being developed. \n\"The government should not hoodwink us,\" she told the BBC.\nMr Shapps said a bigger problem was road transport, which contributes 90% of transport-related carbon emissions in the UK, but that he felt progress was being made.\n\"I think we're reaching that tipping point. When you switch on the television or or see an internet ad, you'll see that electric cars and hybrid cars are almost exclusively the ones being advertised right now,\" he said.\nThe government has already said that sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK from 2030.\nThe transport plan says all new lorries will be zero-carbon by 2040, running on batteries or hydrogen under a world-leading UK policy. \nA recent study showed that trucks accounted for 2% of vehicles in the EU, but 22% of road transport emissions.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the government's proposals on lorries were speculative, unrealistic and potentially damaging to business.\n\"These alternative HGVs don't yet exist - we don't know when they will and what they will cost,\" said RHA chief executive Richard Burnett.\n\"For many haulage companies, there are fears around cost of new vehicles and a collapse in resale value of existing lorries. The problem is even worse for coaches, which are more expensive to buy and have longer lifecycles.\"\nThe government's transport decarbonisation plan also says:\nHowever, critics said the plans did not go far enough.\nKerry McCarthy MP, Labour\u2019s shadow transport minister, said: \u201cThis plan has been a long time coming, but it was barely worth the wait.\n\"The government is still stalling when it comes to the tough decisions needed,\" she added, citing the rise in rail fares and the cut in plug-in car grants. \n\u201cAt a time when we should be showing global leadership and pressing ahead with this agenda, it's clear ministers still have a long way to go.\u201d\nThe Green Party's Ms Lucas said that it was \"a missed opportunity to really rethink how we organise how we travel\".\nGreen groups said problem areas remained such as:\nThe government has been discussing a proposal to work with employers on \u201cCommute Zero\u201d - a project that could encourage more lift-sharing and working from home.\nMinisters have also agreed that the whole central government fleet of 40,000 cars and vans should be fully zero-emission by 2027.\nHowever, the Treasury will face difficult choices, as revenue streams shift as a result of the zero-carbon strategy.\nCurrently, the Treasury receives more than \u00a330bn a year from fuel taxes on conventional cars. \nOne alternative could be a pay-as-you-drive tax, but a government spokeswoman told BBC News there were no plans at present to introduce road pricing.\nShe also said there were no plans for a frequent flyer levy. \nWhere transport policy is devolved, the plan applies just to England only. Where policy is reserved, this will apply to the UK as a whole and the UK government will consult with the UK nations."

Since then, more than 81,000 people in Spain have died with coronavirus.\nSpain has three levels of emergency: state of emergency, state of exception, and the highest level, state of siege.\nUnder the emergency rules almost all people in the country were ordered to stay at home, and were only permitted to leave for essential reasons. All but essential businesses were closed.\nThe laws were in place until June 2020, though some restrictions were reinstated later in the year when the country faced a second wave.\nBut Spain's Constitutional Court said in a statement that it had voted, by a slim majority of six to five, to find that the state of emergency was not enough to give the restrictions constitutional backing.\nThis is because the rules were equivalent to a suppression of fundamental rights, it said.\nIn order to legally limit people's freedoms to the extent they did last year, the court said, the government would have had to declare a state of exception rather than a state of emergency.\nIn Spain, a state of emergency - known as a \"state of alarm\" in Spanish - can be declared by the government and implemented before it is debated in parliament. This allows the government to put new rules into force quickly.\nA state of exception, however, is not directly agreed by the government. Instead, the proposal needs to be taken to parliament first, which then has to declare the emergency.\nThe court ruling was in response to a suit brought by the far-right political party Vox."

      "tags": "Cuba,Havana,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Cuba says it will allow travellers arriving in the country to bring in food, medicine and other essentials without paying import duties.\nThe announcement was made following the biggest anti-government protests on the Communist-run island in decades. \nThousands took to the streets on Sunday to protest over food and medicine shortages, price increases and the government's handling of Covid-19.\nThere will be no limit on such goods brought in by travellers from Monday.\nHowever, the measure is only temporary and has been derided as \"too little, too late\" by critics of the government.\nPrime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz announced the change on Wednesday at a meeting broadcast on state television.\nHis tone was much more conciliatory than that of President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, who, as the protests spread, had called on government supporters to take to the streets to \"defend the revolution\".\nIn contrast, Mr Marrero Cruz said the lifting of the import duties \"was a demand made by many travellers and it was necessary to take this decision\".\nHe added that the government would \"assess things\" after 31 December.\nTravellers to Cuba can currently bring up to 10kg of medicine into the country tax-free. However, they must pay customs duties on the limited amount of food and personal hygiene supplies they are allowed to bring in.\nScrapping the import duties had been suggested by some Cubans as a way to ease the shortages of medicines and food on the island.\nThe government had introduced the taxes to cut down on \"mulas\" (Spanish for mules), the name given to couriers who travel to Cuba from abroad heavily laden with foreign goods and currency.\nBut the measure not only hit Cubans who turned to the \"mulas\" to bring them items they could not get hold of in state-run shops, but also those who relied on relatives abroad to provide them with badly needed food and hygiene products.\nWhile the scrapping of the import tax is seen as a rare concession by the government, its temporary nature has been a source of derision.\nWith the Covid pandemic leading to a restriction in the number of flights arriving on the island, the effect the lifting of the restrictions will have is thought to be limited.\nBut many of those who commented on social media also thought it was little more than a sticking plaster. Some wrote that they had taken the risk of protesting - in a country where unauthorised public gatherings are illegal - to achieve much more more than this limited concession. \n\"No, we don't want crumbs. We want freedom,\" government critic and journalist Yoani S\u00e1nchez tweeted shortly after the announcement. \n\"Blood wasn't spilled on Cuban streets in order to import a few extra suitcases.\"\nThe protests, which started on Sunday, were not only the biggest but also the most widespread to be held in Cuba in decades.\nDozens have been arrested nationwide since the unrest began. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday that one man had died.\nNews of the protests spread on social media, where demonstrators posted live footage of gatherings across the country.\nMobile internet access was introduced in Cuba in the last few years but is provided by a state-run company.\nIn the wake of the protests, there was an internet blackout which many blamed on the government trying to block communications. \nAFP news agency journalists reported that Cuban authorities had restored access to the internet on Wednesday. However, some messaging and social media platforms reportedly remained blocked on 3G and 4G, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter.\nStreets in Havana were calmer on Wednesday, although there was a heavy security presence.\nArrests seem to have continued in the country in recent days. Cuban YouTuber Dina Stars was conducting an interview for a Spanish broadcaster on Tuesday when she told the channel that security forces had come to take her away. She later posted about it on Instagram.\nAnd Reuters obtained footage from Tuesday which it said was of a young man in the south-eastern town of Gibara being arrested.\nThe protests come amid a severe economic crisis. Tourism, one of the most important sectors, has been devastated by the restrictions on travel during the Covid pandemic.\nSugar, which is mostly exported, is another key earner for Cuba. But this year's harvest has been much worse than expected.\nAs a result, the government's reserves of foreign currency are depleted, meaning it cannot buy in imported goods to supplement shortages, as it would normally do.\nCuba has blamed the US and its economic sanctions for the protests and Cuba's wider problems. On Wednesday, the US called for the release of all peaceful protesters detained in Cuba during recent unrest."

      "text": "Letting small family farms go to the wall will \"break the backbone of Britain's rural communities\", Prince Charles has said.\nThe focus on producing plentiful and cheap food threatens the survival of the country's smaller farms, he says.  \nIf they go it will \"rip the heart out of the British countryside\", he warns.\nThe government says it wants to support all farmers and \"the choices that they take on their own holdings\".\nIt comes ahead of the publication of the National Food Strategy, the first major review of Britain's food system in more than 70 years.\nThe strategy was commissioned by the government and is headed by Henry Dimbleby, the founder of the Leon restaurant chain.\nThursday's report will explore the links between food production and environmental degradation including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and the sustainable use of resources.\nIt will include recommendations for the government, which has promised to respond with a White Paper within six months.\nThe first part of the strategy was published in July last year and highlighted the connection between obesity, poverty and the UK's high Covid-19 death toll.\nThe Prince of Wales has been concerned with food and the environment for most of his adult life.\nHis latest intervention comes in the form of an essay for Radio 4's Today programme.  \nIn it, he condemns the super-efficient intensive agricultural system that produces much of the food we eat as a \"dead end\".\nHe describes how, over the years, he has watched with increasing concern as many of the nation's \"precious landscapes\" have been slowly diminished in the name of \"efficiency\".\nWe don't take account of what he calls the \"hidden costs\" of modern industrial farming, warns the prince.\nHe cites damage to soils and watercourses and the emissions that add to global warming.  \n\"We must put nature back at the heart of the equation\", he urges, or we risk undermining the true source of all our prosperity - nature.\n\"How we produce food has a direct impact on the Earth's capacity to sustain us, which has a direct impact on human health and economic prosperity,\" he says.\nHe does find some cause for optimism, however.  \nHe says he is increasingly confident we can achieve a transition to more sustainable forms of agriculture and praises the efforts of high-profile figures including footballer Marcus Rashford, chef Jamie Oliver and Henry Dimbleby to improve the nation's food system from \"field to fork\".\nHe describes visiting a new centre for farm and food education in the Cotswolds which aims to produce healthy food in an environmentally-friendly and economically-viable way.\nThere are promising investment opportunities in these kind of innovative approaches to agriculture, he believes, and he says he is working to link private investors with the pioneers of these new sustainable approaches to farming.\nA particular concern is improving soil health and fertility.  \n\"If we regenerate degraded soils around the world, we could capture as much as 70% of the world's carbon emissions,\" the Prince suggests.\n\"Only by benefitting nature can we benefit people,\" concludes the Prince. \nAnd that is the only way of ensuring the future of our living planet, he says.\nThe Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said new environmental land management schemes would \"support farmers to produce high quality food in a more sustainable way, and deliver the environmental change that we all want to see\".\n\"Our new system will be centred around incentivising sustainable farming practices alongside profitable food production and rewarding farmers for producing public goods such as better air and water quality, protecting wildlife and soil health,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"We want to support all of our farmers, and the choices that they take on their own holdings. We have recently set out further details of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which will eventually be open to every farmer in England.\""

      "text": "\"We are planning for war and praying for peace.\"\nDr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge.\n\"We are absolutely gutted - it's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital,\" she said.\n\"People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying.\"\nStaff, already exhausted, she said, were demoralised at having to reopen a Covid ward which required full protective equipment.\n\"Nurses understandably are really distressed at having to go through this again - having to put on the full PPE - it's very stressful.\"\nThe hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, currently has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care. That is a lot less than the peak in January - but the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week.\nThe average ages are lower than during the first two waves, and at least two of the seriously ill patients are in their 30s and unvaccinated.\nThe north-east of England has seen a surge in cases with eight out of the current top 10 hotspots in the UK.  \nAlmost all the cases nationally involve the Delta variant which first started surging in the north-west of England and Glasgow, so its spread through the North East is unsurprising. The demographics in urban areas are similar, with health inequalities and social deprivation and underlying health conditions leaving some patients vulnerable.\nThe number of hospital patients with Covid is above where it was in early April, a trend already seen in the north-west of England. Services are being stretched because of high demand and staff needing to isolate.\nHealth leaders in South Tyneside and Sunderland have made an appeal to the public to stick carefully to social distancing guidelines, to wear face masks in all health settings and to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Visits to adult wards have been suspended at three sites.\nOn Teesside there has been a plea to people to act with caution, and to continue with face coverings when recommended even after legal restrictions in England are lifted on 19 July.\nAndy Preston, the elected mayor of Middlesbrough, told the BBC: \"We are putting a message out in Middlesbrough that rates are ballooning. This thing is spreading like wildfire across the whole region. \n\"We are not saying to panic, we are not saying for people to be terrified. We are saying to people just be really careful. \n\"This is now about schools, it's about businesses, it's about jobs and it's about mental wellbeing. People are getting pinged on apps left right and centre. They are being frightened, confused, don't know what to do.\"\nLocal resident Sandra Forsyth told us that she regretted not getting vaccinated when she contracted Covid: \"It's a nightmare. Out of breath. Just awful. I was hospitalised for a day and we've had the ambulance out to me as well because it's all on the chest.\" \nShe said she would get a jab as soon as possible and she urged others who hadn't done so to think again.\nAt the University Hospital of North Tees, they are continuing to provide normal cancer services and non-urgent care.  \nBut Chris Tulloch, deputy medical director of North Tees and Hartlepool Foundation Trust, says with case numbers predicted to continue rising into August, the situation could become more challenging.\n\"We are coping, but I would say we are just coping. And if things get more serious I think it will be more difficult to deal with, and we may have to make difficult decisions about what we are treating. \n\"We did have to stop our elective surgery programme last year because we needed the staff from theatre, who have the expertise in ventilation and looking after the critically ill, to look after patients with Covid.\"\nHospital staff say they understand the desire of people to regain some of the freedoms lost during lockdown, but they are worried about the implications if all social distancing is immediately abandoned.  \nDr Monaghan says the NHS will cope but the behaviour of local communities from 19 July will determine how serious the challenge will be.\n\"We are praying that the public do maintain some sense of perspective on this - somewhere between everybody being locked down and getting what they want.\" "

      "text": "Four Iranian intelligence officials have been charged with plotting to kidnap a New York-based journalist critical of Iran, US prosecutors say.\nThe indictment did not name the target, but Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-American author and activist, says it was her. \nThe conspirators, who all live in Iran and remain at large, also allegedly plotted to lure a person in the UK and three others in Canada to Iran.\nIran's government said the allegations were \"ridiculous and baseless\".\nThe US justice department says the Iranian officials sought to lure the New York-based journalist to a third country where the abduction was planned.\n\"To he honest, emotionally I got angry. I got furious. Instead of just being scared it made me furious,\" Ms Alinejad told BBC News, describing how FBI agents came to her home to tell her that she was \"not safe\".\nThe plotters even offered money to the writer's relatives in Iran to betray them, which they refused to do, the indictment contends.\nThey hired private investigators to spy on the target's Brooklyn home and family, and set up a live video feed of the property.\nThey also researched a service offering military-style speedboats for evacuation from New York City, and maritime routes to Venezuela, an ally of Iran.\n\"I told myself that for years and years the government tried to create fear inside the society, tried to scare us,\" Ms Alinejad told BBC World TV on Wednesday.\n\"But this is the time that actually the government of Iran, the whole intelligence services of Iran are scared of me.\"\nThe intelligence officials worked to procure surveillance of the four people targeted in Canada and the UK, according to the indictment.\nMs Alinejad, 44, is a prominent figure on social media and hosts a programme on the US-funded satellite TV channel Voice of America Persian. \nShe runs the My Stealthy Freedom and White Wednesdays campaigns against the mandatory wearing of headscarves for Iranian women.\nAddressing the indictment on TV on Tuesday, she said: \"Initially, I naturally felt shocked. Then I got worried... Then I thought about it: we have been scared of the Islamic regime for a lifetime. But now the Islamic regime is scared of me.\" \nThe indictment says the Iranian officials were aided by an Iranian resident of California, Niloufar Bahadorifar.\nShe was arrested this month and charged with providing financial aid to the conspirators and violating sanctions against Iran. She has pleaded not guilty.\nWilliam Sweeney, the head of New York's FBI office, said it sounded a bit like \"some far-fetched movie plot\". \nIranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Wednesday that such \"Hollywood scenarios\" were \"nothing unexpected from America\".\nIn 2019, the Paris-based dissident journalist Ruhollah Zam was enticed by Iranian agents to travel to Iraq, where he was kidnapped and taken to Iran. He was executed last year after being convicted of sedition charges."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has set out the \"skeleton\" of a plan to \"level up\" the country, by spreading power and opportunity more evenly.\nIn a speech in Coventry, the PM insisted his flagship policy will not make the \"rich parts\" of the UK poorer but would be a \"win win\" for everyone.\nHe also pledged to hand more power to local leaders, with the possibility of elected mayors for counties.\nLabour described Mr Johnson's speech as \"gibberish nonsense\".\nThe party's deputy leader Angela Rayner dismissed the PM's promises as a \"PR exercise\", adding that Mr Johnson \"does not do detail, he does soundbites\". \n\"It is all jam tomorrow and a load of baloney. What he pretends and what he says he is going to do, is not what happens in reality.\"\nIn a wide-ranging speech, Mr Johnson said the government wanted to \"rewrite the rulebook\" on local devolution and offer county areas in England \"new deals\" to give them the same powers as those currently given to major cities.\nAnd he promised a flexible approach to those deals, including the option for directly elected mayors, but said there was no \"one-size-fits-all\" template.\nThe former London mayor urged local leaders with ideas for how to improve their communities to come forward, promising to give them \"the tools to make things happen for their communities\"..\nHe said he did not want to see the return of what he called \"loony-left\" councils, but added: \"We will deal with anybody.\" \nThe Conservatives first promised to \"level up\" the country in their manifesto for the 2019 general election, in which they targeted - and won - so-called \"red wall\" parliamentary seats in the Midlands and northern England previously dominated by Labour.\nThe plan, some of which has already been outlined, involves investing in transport, skills and businesses to address regional disparities.\nThe government is expected to publish more details in September.\nAsked what his clear strategy was for \"levelling up\", he said: \"I am respectfully going to urge you to just go back over some of what I said because I do think that in all fairness there was at least the skeleton of what to do.\"\nBoris Johnson again tried to explain the purpose of the \"levelling up\" agenda and talked about the UK's huge regional imbalances, entrenched inequalities and squandered opportunities.\nIn well-trailed remarks he also said that the aim of getting more government spending and private investment into poorer parts of the UK would not come at the detriment of London and the south east - an attempt to reassure traditional Tory voters who might be feeling left out themselves.\nIn terms of policy prescription the speech was fairly thin. \nA White Paper is promised in the autumn and today Mr Johnson clattered through a list of things - from tackling crime, building football pitches, laying railway lines - that he seemed to say all fell under the umbrella of levelling up. \nBut he also proposed greater regional devolution and suggested county leaders could get new powers. \nHe said if anyone could think of a better title than county mayors they should email him, which rather summed up the speech.\nIn his speech, the prime minister said the government will have \"made progress in levelling up when we have begun to raise living standards, spread opportunity, improved our public services and restored people's sense of pride in their community\".\nInvesting in more deprived areas will relieve pressure on parts of the UK that are \"over-heating\" and that previous governments focused too much on \"areas where house prices are already high and where transport is already congested\", he added.\nBut he insisted that there will not be \"levelling down\" in prosperous places, adding: \"We don't want to decapitate the tall poppies.\n\"We don't think you can make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer.\"\nHe said that \"levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation. It's not robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's not zero-sum. It's win-win\".\nThe PM's speech was welcomed by county councils.\nCounty Councils Network spokesman Martin Hill said: \"Local areas should be able to decide the most appropriate devolution arrangements for counties\".\nHe added: \"We are pleased that this looks firmly on the table.\""

      "tags": "Spotify,Streaming,Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport,Apple,Music",
      "text": "The music industry is weighted against artists, with even successful pop stars seeing \"pitiful returns\" from streaming, a committee of MPs has said.\nThey are calling for a \"complete reset\" of the market, with musicians given a \"fair share\" of the \u00a3736.5 million that UK record labels earn from streaming.\nIn a report, they said royalties should be split 50/50, instead of the current rate, where artists receive about 16%.\nThe findings came after a six-month inquiry into music streaming.\n\"While streaming has brought significant profits to the recorded music industry, the talent behind it - performers, songwriters and composers - are losing out,\" said Julian Knight, MP, who chairs parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee.\n\"Only a complete reset of streaming that enshrines in law their rights to a fair share of the earnings will do.\" \nThe findings will be seen as a victory by pop stars like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Melanie C, Wolf Alice and Jessie Ware, who recently called on the Prime Minister to reform the way musicians get paid when their songs are streamed.\nMusician Tom Gray, whose #BrokenRecord campaign prompted the inquiry, said he was \"overjoyed\" by the findings.\n\"It feels like a massive vindication,\" he said. \"They've really come to the same conclusions that we've been saying for a very long time.\"\nThe BPI, which represents the UK recorded music industry, was more cautious. \nIt said streaming was \"enabling more artists than ever\" to earn a \"long-term, sustainable income\" and that new policies should be properly examined to ensure against \"unintended consequences for investment into new talent\".\nAt present, Spotify is believed to pay between \u00a30.002 and \u00a30.0038 per stream, while Apple Music pays about \u00a30.0059. YouTube pays the least - about \u00a30.00052 (or 0.05 pence) per stream.\nAll that money goes to rights-holders, a blanket term that covers everything from massive record companies to artists who release their own music. That money is then divided up between everyone involved in making the record.\nOften, the recording artist will only receive about 13% of the revenue, with labels and publishers keeping the rest.\nArtists who release their own music, or who work with independent labels and distribution companies, tend to get a higher share.\nA survey by the Ivors Academy and Musicians' Union found that in 2019, 82% of professional musicians made less than \u00a3200 from streaming, whilst only 7% made more than \u00a31,000.\nThe hearings were full of testy exchanges. Some witnesses said they were scared to speak out for fear of reprisals; and the head of one record label was described as \"living in cloud cuckoo land\" after he claimed artists were happy with the music streaming model.\nMercury Prize nominee Nadine Shah made headlines after telling the committee she had been forced to move back in with her parents because \"earnings from my streaming are not significant enough to keep the wolf away from the door\".\nPop songwriter Fiona Bevan revealed she'd earned just \u00a3100 for a track on Kylie Minogue's number one album, Disco. \"Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,\" she told MPs. \"It's quite shameful.\"\nChic's Nile Rodgers said that the finances of streaming are shrouded in secrecy, adding: \"We don't even know what a stream is worth and there's no way you could even find out what a stream is worth, and that's not a good relationship.\"\nThe three major labels - Sony, Universal and Warner Music - faced some of the toughest questioning of the inquiry, and were accused of a \"lack of clarity\" by MPs.\nThey largely argued to maintain the status quo, saying any disruption could damage investment in new music, and resisted the idea that streaming was comparable to radio - where artists receive a 50/50 royalty split.\n\"Streaming is 24-7 in every country in the world, you can listen to the greatest record store ever - it's clearly a sale, it's not radio, it's on-demand,\" said David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK.\nRepresentatives from the streaming companies suggested they were \"open-minded\" about changing the royalty system, but noted that 70% of their income already goes to labels, publishers and artists.\n\"It is a narrow-margin business, so it wouldn't actually take that much to upset the so-called apple cart,\" said Apple Music's Elena Segal.\nThe committee's report said streaming had \"undoubtedly helped save the music industry\" after decades of piracy, \"but it is clear that what has been saved does not work for everyone\".\nThey recommended that the government pass legislation to give performers the right to \"equitable remuneration\", whereby labels and artists receive an equal share of streaming royalties.\nThe report called it a \"simple yet effective solution\", as the right already exists in UK law when songs are played on radio and TV. \nMPs also raised \"deep concerns\" about the dominance of the major music companies, and urged the government to refer the case to the Competition and Markets Authority.\nOther recommendations included:\nThe committee also expressed concerns that \"the economics of streaming entrench historically successful artists and create barriers for new performers\", with perennial hits by Abba, Queen and Fleetwood Mac starving up-and-coming musicians of opportunities.\nFigures released yesterday showed that new music accounted for just 33% of the music streamed in the US this year, with older songs dominating people's listening choices.\nThe streaming services themselves largely escaped criticism, but MPs said YouTube's dominance was a cause for concern - citing figures that it accounts for 51% of music streaming while contributing 7% of music industry revenue.\nThey warned that users' ability to upload music to YouTube without licensing it from record labels gave it an \"unfair advantage\"; and urged the government to introduce \"legally enforceable obligations to normalise licensing arrangements\" on sites that host user-generated videos, such as YouTube, TikTok and Facebook.\nTom Gray said the report confirmed what his #BrokenRecord campaign had been telling record labels all along: \"That their business model needs to change and that they need to face the reality of that and get on with it\".\nHe said he hoped the government would enact the recommendations quickly, potentially by acting on a private member's bill by Labour MP Kevin Brennan that seeks to change copyright laws around streaming.\n\"This is something that they can do for the British cultural sector, where they don't have to go and negotiate with Brussels,\" he told the BBC. \"If they want to help British creators, inventors and performers, this is something they can just do.\"\nThe Association of Independent Music (AIM) welcomed the report's praise for independent record labels, who traditionally pay higher royalty rates to their artists.\n\"However, our view is that equitable remuneration will not deliver the outcome they are hoping for,\" said CEO Paul Pacifico. \"It is a 20th Century solution not fit for the 21st Century digital market and will leave the next generation of artists worse off.\"\nThe BPI argued that streaming worked in artists' favour - with 2,000 artists set to achieve 10 million streams this year, the equivalent of selling 10,000 CDs, or making about \u00a329,000. It warned unpicking the current system could damage investment in new music.\n\"When considering this report, the Government also needs to consider the vital role that labels play as the leading investors into artists' careers, with investment in artists by record labels growing year-on-year,\" said CEO Geoff Taylor.\n\"We will carefully examine the findings of this report, but it is essential that any policy proposals avoid unintended consequences for investment into new talent, and do not imperil this country's extraordinary global success in music.\"\nMeanwhile, the Musicians Union called the report \"revolutionary\". \n\"It grasps the issue, identifies the problems and recommends achievable and practical solutions, which won't cost the taxpayer a penny,\" said general secretary Horace Trubridge.\nIn a joint statement, the Featured Artists Coalition and Music Managers Forum said the \"landmark\" report could \"fundamentally improve\" the economic situation for thousands of musicians.\n\"This is a once in a lifetime moment to reset our business along fairer and more equitable lines, it is not an opportunity to be wasted.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

[to secure] the wellbeing of not only our generation, but of our children and grandchildren. Europe is ready to lead the way.\"\nThe measures are likely to push up household heating bills, as well as increase the cost of flights in the EU. Financial assistance will be available for people to install insulation and make other long-term changes to their homes.\n\"We're going to ask a lot of our citizens,\" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said. \"We're also going to ask a lot of our industries, but we do it for good cause. We do it to give humanity a fighting chance.\"\nOpposition is also expected from some industry leaders, such as airlines and vehicle manufacturers, as well as from eastern member states that rely heavily on coal.\nOne EU diplomat told Reuters that the success of the package would rest on its ability to be realistic and socially fair, while also not destabilising the economy.\n\"The aim is to put the economy on a new level, not to stop it,\" they said.  \nThe measures, billed as the EU's most ambitious plan yet to tackle climate change, have been named the Fit for 55 package because they would put the bloc on track to meet its 2030 goal of reducing emissions by 55% from 1990 levels.\nBy 2019, the EU had cut its emissions by 24% from 1990 levels.\nSome of the key proposals include:\nBut corporate lobby BusinessEurope denounced the plan, saying it \"risks destabilising the investment outlook\" for sectors such as steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electric power \"enormously\".\nAnd Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said: \"Aviation is committed to decarbonisation as a global industry. We don't need persuading, or punitive measures like taxes to motivate change.\"\nAt the same time, environmentalist campaigners have said the proposals don't go far enough.\n\"Celebrating these policies is like a high-jumper claiming a medal for running under the bar,\" Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss said in a statement.\n\"This whole package is based on a target that is too low, doesn't stand up to science, and won't stop the destruction of our planet's life-support systems.\"\nClimate campaigner Greta Thunberg said that unless the EU \"tears up\" its proposals, \"the world will not stand a chance of staying below 1.5C of global heating\".\nIn September the EU Commission set out its blueprint for reaching the 55% reduction by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures.\nThe targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\nThe Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change.\nThe scale of this 12-pronged plan is breathtaking. It will likely have an impact on every citizen of Europe in almost every aspect of their lives.\nThe scope is so huge because the target is so tough. \nFrom 1990 to 2019 the EU cut carbon emissions by 24% - now it proposes to slash CO2 by another 31% in just 9 years. That's what's needed if the 2050 net-zero target is to be achieved. \nSo as well as boosting renewables, the EU is now set to tackle the really tough issues of home heating and transport. The proposals would see the end to new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. \nEurope's emissions trading scheme will also be reformed to include heating and road transportation. Fossil fuels used in shipping and aviation will face tax rises.\nOne of the most eye-catching proposals is a carbon border tax on goods like steel, cement and fertiliser to ensure that European industry, which has to pay for permits to use carbon, can compete. However, the proposal is contentious and could spark a trade war with China and the US.\nThe ambitious package will now face months of negotiations with member states, with poorer countries wary of new policies that could raise costs for consumers.\nThe commission is betting that instead of hordes of yellow-vest protesters taking to the streets, citizens will be willing to pay a price for cleaner air, lower emissions, and more sustainable lifestyles. \nThe rest of the world will watch this huge gamble with interest.

      "tags": "Department for Transport,Rail travel,HS2,Welsh government",
      "text": "A cross-party group of MPs has called for HS2 to be reclassified as an England-only project so Wales receives proportional funds. \nThey said the UK government's own analysis concluded the rail project would produce \"an economic dis-benefit to Wales\".\nThe Welsh government called the classification of HS2 as an England and Wales project \"unfair and biased\". \nThe UK government said it had committed \u00a31.5bn to Welsh railways. \nHS2 is a high-speed rail line planned to link London with Birmingham and on to Manchester and Leeds. \nThe multi-billion pound project, which could see costs rise to \u00a3106bn, has been controversial after estimates that the Welsh economy could lose out due to inferior transport infrastructure. \nThe MPs want HS2 to be reclassified as an England-only project despite rail infrastructure not being devolved in Wales beyond the core valleys lines.\nThe Welsh government receives a proportional top-up to the budget when new spending is announced for devolved areas in England which will not apply to Wales, through what is known as \"Barnett consequentials\".\nThe report says while the Welsh government received \"approximately \u00a3755m in Barnett consequentials\" between 2015 and 2019 as a result of the Department for Transport spending money on HS2, it will not receive a proportionate amount because it has been classified by the Treasury as an \"England and Wales project\".\nThis has attracted criticism from the MPs because the rail line will run solely in England. \nThe Welsh Affairs Committee said: \"It is a project of unprecedented size and complexity and has already created several thousand jobs as part of a supply chain that spans the country, including Wales.\" \nBut it said Wales would \"not benefit in the same way as Scotland and Northern Ireland from Barnett consequentials arising from the HS2 project. This is despite the fact that UK government's own analysis has concluded that HS2 will produce an economic dis-benefit for Wales\". \nIt said HS2 could \"yield direct benefits to Welsh rail passengers if it is accompanied by enhancements to the North Wales mainline, including upgrades at Chester and Crewe stations which will be required for full electrification of the North Wales mainline to proceed\".\nThe report also calls for a new Wales Rail Board of Welsh and UK government bodies to identify areas where Welsh railways could be improved and invested in. \nThe MPs also have called on the UK government to bring forward proposals for greater connectivity between Swansea, Cardiff and Bristol by the end of 2021, calling the decision to cancel the electrification of the Cardiff-Swansea mainline \"short-sighted and regrettable\".\nThe group, chaired by Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, said if clear benefits for passengers and freight users could be delivered by transferring powers over rail infrastructure from the UK government to the Welsh government then \"the case for further devolution would be compelling\". \nBut they said \"few benefits to rail users have been identified\" and the benefits of \"existing management arrangements are considerable\".\nThe Welsh government welcomed the calls to \"address unfair and biased categorisation of HS2 as an England and Wales project, which continues to disadvantage rail investment in Wales\". \nA spokesman said their \"long term objective remains full devolution of the rail network and a fair funding settlement for rail infrastructure in Wales\". \nBut they said \"irrespective of where responsibility rests in the short term\" they supported \"close strategic collaboration\" to \"meet passenger needs\" and \"support our decarbonisation commitments\".\nA spokesperson for the UK government's Department for Transport said: \"We have already committed  a record \u00a31.5bn to the Welsh railways in recent years and the recently announced Union Connectivity Review will look at how best to enhance transport links across the United Kingdom to improve connectivity.\" \nThe UK government has argued HS2 will boost reliability, connectivity and capacity on routes across the UK, including services into Wales.

      "text": "The FBI disregarded allegations about a prolific USA Gymnastics child abuser and later made serious errors in the investigation, a watchdog has found. \nThe long-awaited report gave a scathing assessment of the FBI's investigation into former team doctor Larry Nassar. \nNassar was sentenced to over 300 years in jail in 2018 for molesting gymnasts.\nNumerous missteps and cover-ups by FBI agents allowed his abuse to continue for months after the case was first opened, the report found.\nRachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of abuse, said that while the US justice department's internal review exposed serious failings, there was a lack of accountability. \n\"This report lays bare the corruption, but its conclusion says 'doesn't matter'. Because nothing happens now,\" she wrote in a series of tweets. \"These agents retire on government pensions while survivors fight to stay alive.\"\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the FBI acknowledged the findings of the report, calling the handling of the Nassar file \"inexcusable and a discredit to this organisation\". \n\"We will take all necessary steps to ensure that the failures of the employees outlined in the report do not happen again,\" the agency said.\nThe 119-page report by the Department of Justice Inspector General found that despite the seriousness of the allegations against Nassar, the FBI field office in Indianapolis dragged its feet in responding. \nIn July 2015, following an internal review into Nassar, USA Gymnastics reported a number of allegations to the FBI in Indianapolis. After some \"limited follow-up\" that summer, the agency \"did not undertake any investigative activity\" on the case for more than eight months.\nDuring that time, the report said, Nassar's sexual assaults continued. \nConfronted by their mistakes, two FBI officials lied during interviews to cover up their errors, the report said. \nAt the time the allegations surfaced, one of the FBI agents, Jay Abbott, had been in discussions with USA Gymnastics officials about a job with the Olympic Committee. Mr Abbott retired from the agency in 2018. \nThe other, an unnamed employee, \"is no longer a supervisor\", the FBI said on Wednesday, and will not work on FBI matters until an internal investigation is complete. \nMr Abbott's lawyer, Josh Minkler, said in a statement to Reuters news agency that his client \"thanks the law enforcement officers and prosecutors who brought Larry Nassar to justice\".\nThe internal review into the FBI's handling of the Nassar case was launched in 2018 when the disgraced doctor was sentenced to decades behind bars. \nHe has been accused of sexual abuse by more than 330 women and girls from USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, including Olympic stars Simone Biles and Aly Raisman."

      "text": "Large businesses have said they will maintain a cautious approach to bringing staff back to the office despite the lifting of final Covid restrictions in England on Monday.\nThe government announced yesterday that it will no longer instruct people to work at home from 19 July.\nBut firms spoken to by the BBC said they did not plan to bring all staff back to the office.\nMany businesses said they will opt for a staggered approach for employees. \nDeloitte said it will increase the number of staff allowed to work in its offices to 50% capacity from next week.\nBut the accountancy firm expects that level to stay in place until September.\nNatWest said that it will bring staff back to the office from 19 July but it will only be a small number of \"priority workers\".\nInsurance group Aviva said it expects \"to see more of our people returning\". But a spokesman said that \"the vast majority of people at Aviva want to work flexibly in future\" and employees will combine going into the office with working from home.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that final restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of Covid will be lifted in England from 19 July, including the guidance on office working.\nBut the government said that it \"would expect and recommend a gradual return\" of workers to offices \"over the summer\".\nDeloitte currently operates its offices at 30% capacity and employees have to book desks. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had always intended to take a \"gradual approach\" to moving staff back to its sites.\nIt estimates that it will take between six and eight weeks to prepare its offices to deal with 100% capacity which it expects to reach in September.\nNatWest said a \"very small number of people\" will be invited back to its offices in England from Monday for roles \"that can't really be done from home\". These include market traders as well as people who work in NatWest's treasury department and roles where employees need to meet clients.\nIt also said \"people who would rather work in the office for wellbeing reasons\" can return to its sites from Monday.\nAccountancy firm KPMG has allowed people to work from its offices if they made a request to their manager. \nFrom next week, they will no longer need permission to do so but the firm has also introduced a \"four-day fortnight\" hybrid model of working. It means that KPMG employees spend four days working in the office and the rest of the fortnight either at home or at client sites. \n\"It makes sense that the order to work from home if possible is removed at this stage,\" said Confederation of British Industry policy director, Michael Fell. \"The reality is that many firms are well-advanced in their plans and are proceeding with hybrid working models, just as the government advises. \nRoger Barker, policy director of the Institute of Directors (IoD) industry group, said: \"Businesses across the country will welcome the opportunity to begin to return to relative normality from next week.\"\nHowever, he criticised the government for failing to provide adequate guidance on areas such as wearing face masks which, from Monday, will cease to be mandatory but will be recommended.\nDr Barker said there has been \"real frustration about the mixed messages\" businesses have been receiving from the government. \n\"The latest guidance has shifted the responsibility from the government to businesses by removing mandatory rules on things like face masks and replacing them with voluntary recommendations,\" he said. \"Whilst it is right that companies should be allowed to take decisions based on their own unique circumstances, it is vital that government provides businesses with best practice in developing their own policies.\""

      "text": "More of Wales' Covid-19 rules could change over the next few weeks from being legal requirements to government advice, according to a Welsh minister.\nMick Antoniw said Wales was \"moving to a stage where we are having increasing normality\" but that ministers and officials would evaluate data ahead of the next review on 15 July.\nAll legal restrictions are expected to be lifted in England on 19 July.\nAnd the SNP government is aiming to do the same in Scotland on 9 August.\nWith no date set in Wales, the Conservatives have accused the Welsh government of being \"stuck in lockdown mode\".\nResponding to reports on Sunday that England will move into a period without legal restrictions, where the public will have to exercise \"personal responsibility\", Andrew RT Davies MS, the leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, tweeted: \"It's time for Welsh government to provide clarity on Wales' route to normality.\"\nA further 535 people have tested positive for coronavirus, according to latest data published by Public Health Wales.\nCounsel General Mr Antoniw told the BBC's Politics Wales programme the Welsh government's \"current thinking is that we have obviously an increase in the level of infections, but we have less hospitalisation out of that\". \n\"We want to maximise the vaccination rates still further, and then around the 15th or 16th of July, we'll have a review, and we'll consider what further easings can be taken within the data that we actually have,\" he said.\n\"Setting a date has its own problems because, if you're saying you want to achieve these certain things on this particular date... it is still always dependent on what the latest information is in respect of the infection rates.\n\"We are certainly moving in the direction of a much greater normality.\n\"But the pandemic is going to be with us for some time,\" he added.\nThere have only been minor changes to the rules in Wales since 7 June after the first minister announced a pause in a bid to reduce daily hospital admissions and allow time to vaccinate more people.\nMinisters had considered permitting more indoor mixing, allowing more people to attend indoor events and reopening ice skating rinks, before deciding to hold off.\nIn Wales, people are currently able to meet in private homes if they are in an extended household with a fixed set of other homes, unlike in England where six people from any household can meet.\nNightclubs remain closed, as they do across the UK, while limits on social distancing and how many people can meet outside remain.\nThe restrictions will be reviewed the week starting 12 July, with any further lifting due to be announced by the first minister towards the end of the week.\nAsked on Politics Wales if he foresaw big changes to the rules in Wales during that review, Mr Antoniw said: \"I certainly would envisage a shift in the way in which we assess risks, that we look at things differently. \n\"We look at how much more can be done on the ground by way of guidelines and advice because, clearly, we're moving to a stage where we are having increasing normality.\n\"But it's got to be something that's based on the reality of the fact there are still risks out there.\n\"So, over the next week or so, all that data's going to be evaluated.\n\"We'll take advice from the medical officers and from the scientists, and then we'll work out basically what is the best next step forward in terms of moving towards that greater normality.\n\"But also in a way that doesn't put people at risk,\" he added."

      "tags": "Transport for London,City of London,Sadiq Khan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Face coverings must be worn on London's transport network despite restrictions easing on 19 July, London's mayor says.\nSadiq Khan said he was not prepared to put Tube, bus and other transport users at risk by relaxing the rules on face coverings.\nFace masks have been mandatory on public transport for the past year to reduce the spread of the virus.\nBut those rules will be replaced with government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services.\nEngland is removing most of its Covid restrictions next Monday, and while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he expects masks to be worn in crowded places, such as on a busy Tube train, their use will no longer be compulsory.\nLondon was the first English city to insist on face coverings after Covid restrictions ease. \nOther metro mayors have also joined calls for masks to be worn on public transport.\nIn Scotland, the mandatory use of face coverings will remain in place for \"some time\", First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said, even after the country eases most of its other restrictions on 19 July.  \nThe rules for masks apply in shops and public transport - as well as pubs and restaurants when not seated.\nIn Wales, masks will continue to be required by law in some settings. The Welsh government has said face coverings would still be mandatory on public transport and in health and social care settings.\nMr Khan has made face masks a condition of carriage for the Tube, bus, tram, DLR, Overground and TfL Rail. \nThis means that, despite the easing of restrictions on 19 July, it will be listed as a condition in a legal agreement between Transport for London (TfL) and its customers.\nFace coverings will also be required in taxis and private hire vehicles by both drivers and passengers unless they are exempt.\nMr Khan said: \"We know from the government's own advisors and from the World Health Organisation, that wearing a face covering indoors does reduce transmissions.\n\"It leads to greater public safety and greater public confidence as well.\n\"As long as the virus is still with us, and as long as we're still concerned about the virus being transmitted, we will make it compulsory.\"\nHe said he was \"confident you will see from Monday high levels of the rules being followed just like there have been since last June\".\nTfL's 400 enforcement officers will deny those without a face covering from using London transport, under the plan.\nTfL staff and bus drivers will continue to remind passengers that masks are a requirement, Mr Khan said. \nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has said he will not '\"rule out\" mandating face masks on public transport.\nMr Burnham told the BBC he had not yet taken the decision to mandate masks on trams in Manchester and wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion.\nThe reaction from commuters has been pretty unanimous - the message over masks is mixed and confusing. \nNow, for example, at many merged stations in London - like Barking, Richmond, Wimbledon & Shepherd's Bush - you could go from a rail service where masks are personal choice, to a TfL service where they are a condition of carriage. \nSometimes different services even use the same the platform. \nSo you'll have to become very adept at differentiating a TfL rail service from a national rail one. \nFor an industry that is trying to become more uniform, standardised and is meant to be about making fares and interchanges easier, it's a complete mess. \nThe rail industry says masks will put people off using public transport - polling in London says the opposite. \nThe question now is, will other mayors and train operators follow London's example? \nOr could a simple single rule for all public transport emerge, even at this late stage?\nA poll from the travel watchdog TransportFocus found 56% of Londoners said say they will not use public transport \"unless passengers are required to wear a face covering\".\nThe legal requirement to wear a face covering in shops, public transport and other enclosed public spaces will end on 19 July. It will be replaced with government guidance. \nA government spokeswoman stressed there would be a shift from \"universal government diktat to relying on people's personal responsibility\".\n\"The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they don't normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces,\" she said.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the rules were \"just common sense when you think about it\" as \"you would be in a crowded area\" on London transport.\nLabour has said it is \"irresponsible\" to drop the legal requirement to wear masks.\nThe move has been welcomed by the RMT union, which represents rail workers. It said the approach was consistent with the rules that are currently in place in Scotland, Wales and on Eurostar services to the continent.\nHowever, it said: \"We now have the ludicrous position where a passenger travelling through London will have different rules on the Tube and the mainline services.\"\nMr Shapps said: \"We've seen lots of these rules being different in different parts of the UK.\n\"The same way you can't drink alcohol on London transport systems, but you can on some long distance journeys.\"\nFrom 2 May to 29 May 2021, 86% of TfL customers said they were wearing face coverings at all times on public transport. \nOf the 14% not wearing a face covering at all times or not at all, almost three-quarters (74%) claim to have an exemption or good reason under the current regulations for not doing so, TfL research shows.\nAndy Byford, London's Transport Commissioner, said: \"The transport network is cleaner than ever, with an enhanced cleaning regime, hospital grade cleaning products, widely-available hand sanitizer and UV light fittings on escalator handrails to kill viruses. \n\"It is great news that regular independent testing for the virus by Imperial College has found no trace on our services, and we are now ready to safely welcome back more and more customers from 19 July as people head out to enjoy all that the capital has to offer.\""

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

For many Cubans, these shops are the only way they can buy basic necessities but prices are high.\nPresident Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel has called the demonstrators \"counter-revolutionaries\". \nHis government blamed the United States, and its economic sanctions, for both the protests and Cuba's wider problems. \nUS sanctions have restricted trade with Cuba since 1962. They were tightened under former US President Donald Trump, who also imposed sanctions on Venezuela, which is Cuba's main supplier of oil. \nCuba's foreign minister called it a \"policy of economic suffocation to provoke social unrest in the country\".\nBut the White House said that Cubans had suffered \"decades of repression\". \nSpeaking on Monday, President Joe Biden said the US \"stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights\"."

He has had several operations since the stabbing.\nThe president went to the military hospital in Brasilia early on Wednesday, and medics said then that he would be under observation for 24 to 48 hours.\nBut later the same day, the president's office said Antonio Luiz Macedo, the surgeon who operated on Mr Bolsonaro in 2018, had recommended the president be transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo for additional tests and possible surgery.\nFabio Faria, Brazil's communication's manager, told reporters Mr Bolsonaro had been sedated in the morning ahead of being taken to S\u00e3o Paulo.\nThe president's son Flavio told CNN Brasil that his father had undergone a procedure to remove liquid from his stomach as a precaution.\nFlavio added that his father had had trouble speaking, but that if surgery were needed it should not be a serious procedure.\nMr Bolsonaro earlier tweeted a photo of himself lying in a hospital bed, fitted with sensors and cables, with someone who appears to be a priest standing by his bedside.\nAfter two-and-a-half years of a controversial presidency, Mr Bolsonaro is under growing pressure over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAt the beginning of the month, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest over allegations of corruption involving the purchase of vaccines.\nThe Brazilian leader has been heavily criticised for a lack of a national response to the crisis and his scepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements.\nLast month, deaths with the virus in Brazil passed 500,000 - the second-highest in the world after the US.\nMr Bolsonaro himself caught Covid-19 a year ago but has fully recovered."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "House prices have risen sharply across the UK, driven by an increase of more than 15% in the year to May in the North West of England.\nOfficial figures show property prices also rose at a rapid rate in Scotland, Wales and the North East of England.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the average UK home cost \u00a3255,000 in May.\nThat was \u00a323,000 more than the typical value a year earlier. The 10% rise was the fastest rate for 14 years.\nDetached and terraced homes recorded the biggest price increases, data from the Land Registry in England and Wales show.\nEstate agents have reported huge demand from property buyers during the year so far.\nThis picked up when many buyers wanted to complete their purchases before stamp duty holidays were wound down. In May, the tax breaks were still in place for England, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nHowever, that it not the only explanation for rising prices. Scotland's property tax break was withdrawn at the end of March.\nPeople's changing priorities as a result of the pandemic mean they are looking for bigger homes in which to live and work.\nA lack of homes being put on the market to match demand has also led to rising prices. A majority of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members think prices will continue to rise over the next year for that reason.\n\"The market was being powered by ultra-low mortgage rates, valuable stamp duty savings and people rethinking what they want from their homes due to the pandemic,\" said Katie Cave, director at mortgage broker Clearpoint Finance.\n\"Demand was as rampant as supply was weak, which sent prices skywards.\"\nThe ONS said that house prices in the UK rose by 10% in the year to May.\nThe North West was the region with the highest annual house price growth, with average prices increasing by 15.2%.\nThere were also big rises in Wales (up 13.3%), Scotland (up 12.1%) and the North East of England (up 11.8%).\nAt the other end of the scale, London recorded the slowest property price rise over the year, of 5.2%.\nGed McPartlin, managing director of Ascend Properties, said: \"It's clear that the north-south divide has never been wider.\n\"While this momentous rate of price growth must inevitably slow at some point, we expect this vast difference in property pedigree to remain as buyers in the north continue to benefit from a far more affordable market with, or without, the benefit of a stamp duty saving.\"\nIn Wales, terraced houses rose in price by 15.2% over the same period.\nThat was the fastest rise of any property type, which was mirrored in England, where the value of terraced homes went up by 11.2%.\nThis was closely followed by a 14% rise in the cost of detached homes in Wales, and an 11% increase in England.\nProperties with gardens have proved popular among buyers looking for space inside and outside homes."

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Employment,UK economy,Redundancy",
      "text": "Employers are planning the lowest number of job cuts for over six years, as the economy reopens after the pandemic.\nRedundancy figures for June from the Insolvency Service saw 15,661 positions put at risk in Great Britain. \nLast June saw nearly ten times that number, the worst on record.\nThe reduction in expected redundancies comes despite the imminent end of the furlough scheme which was designed to protect jobs during the pandemic.\nEmployers planning 20 or more redundancies have to file a form called HR1 notifying government at the start of the process. \nThis data gives an early indication of moves in the labour market, months before they show up in the official unemployment figures. \nProposed redundancies have been on a downward trend since September, despite two lockdowns being imposed across most of the UK during that period. June saw the lowest monthly total since February 2015. \nRedundancy figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown a similar trend, a few months later.\n\"The data suggest that there is no spike in redundancies coming in July or August,\" says Xiaowei Xu, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \"The labour market is in a much better position than anyone expected at the start of the pandemic, and it shows how well the furlough scheme has worked,\" \nThe latest numbers are the lowest since the Insolvency Service tightened up reporting guidelines, according to Tony Wilson of the Institute for Employment Studies.  \nBefore that, it was more common for firms to fail to file the necessary paperwork when planning redundancies, leading to artificially lower figures, he says.  \nThe number of HR1 forms filed has also been falling this year, with 179 forms filed by 151 different employers. \nThat's the lowest number of forms since 2014, despite the winding down of the furlough scheme, where the government has supported jobs in the pandemic by paying wages when employers cannot.\nFrom July, employers will have to pay 10% of employees' wages, on top of pension contributions and employer's National Insurance. That rises to 20% in August, until the scheme finishes completely at the end of September.\n\"Anyone who has been on furlough this year has already cost their employers money - so their employers must be keen to keep them on. It's not surprising that they are not being made redundant in large numbers,\" says Ms Xu.\nA total of 11.6 million jobs have been furloughed during the pandemic, though only 2.4 million were still on furlough at the end of May.\nThe success of the furlough scheme and the vaccine programme have lead many economists to cut their forecasts of how many jobs would be lost in the pandemic.\n\"By the time the furlough scheme ends on 30 September, the economy is likely to be strong enough to support a level of employment not far off where it is now. In fact, there is evidence that firms are finding it increasingly difficult to hire workers, especially in industries such as transport and manufacturing,\" says Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\n\"I think it's likely that many firms have already made and communicated their plans and that with the easing of restrictions happening on schedule next week, we just won't see any significant increase in redundancy notifications over the next few months,\" says Mr Wilson.\nUntil recently, HR1 data were not routinely published, except for in Northern Ireland.  \nLast year the BBC began requesting these figures through the Freedom of Information Act, revealing the extraordinary increase in redundancy plans through the spring and summer of 2020. \nThis year, the Insolvency Service has started to publish these figures every month on its website. \nThe data only covers firms proposing 20 or more job cuts, so smaller firms are not picked up by these figures. Employers sometimes notify more redundancies than they eventually make.  \nThe figures are not classified as Official Statistics, which are subject to rigorous quality control procedures.  \nData for Northern Ireland is published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency as part of its monthly Labour Market Report."

      "text": "Developers are \"working at pace\" to deliver NI's full Covid-19 vaccine certification system by next week.\nDr Eddie O'Neill, from the Department of Health, said staff had been working \"non stop\" to deliver the interim paper-based solution.\nSo far, 3,175 certificates have been issued, with about 1,000 currently being processed for people travelling up to 19 July.\nThe scheme allows people to show they have had two doses of a Covid vaccine.\nRegarding its delivery, Dr O'Neill, who is solutions director of the Covid Certification Service at the department, said they were \"still on target\" for 19 July.\nThe interim scheme was introduced to accommodate those planning to visit countries which require proof of two Covid-19 vaccinations.\nThe full certificate will incorporate counterfeit protection measures, requiring a specialised printing process.\n\"In terms of the technical solution, what we were hoping to do with say a fully-automated and planned solution was already quite a feat to deliver by next week,\" Dr O'Neill told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.\n\"For instance the app we are planning to stand up was due to be delivered by mid-August, we are now trying to deliver that next week.\n\"And we are starting testing of the solution tomorrow.\n\"Fingers crossed we have got teams standing up through the weekend, private developers and contractors - they are going to work through the weekend to try and deliver that for next week.\"\nDr O'Neill said the department was also \"hoping to stand up a non-digital route as well which will involve people being able to phone a helpline and printed certificates being sent out\".\n\"The printed certificates - there is a lead time of about 10 days or so because it depends on the post and things getting to you. \n\"So we are going to try and put some detailed instructions up so that as we transition from the interim solution they will understand what they need to do in order to get certification.\"\nPeople travelling before July 19 can still apply for a paper certificate via the NI Direct website.\nMeanwhile, the EU's Digital Covid certificate (DCC) is due to come into effect in the Republic of Ireland on Monday, 19 July.\nThe DCC allows more un-restricted international travel.\nFully vaccinated people, those who can show they have recovered from Covid-19 in the last six months, and those with negative PCR tests taken within 72 hours of departure can avail of it.\nIreland is the last EU country to implement the DCC which came into operation earlier this month.\nThis week, fully vaccinated people in the Republic are being sent by email and post documents with QR codes as proof of their vaccination status.\nThe correspondence amounts to the Irish Digital Covid Certificate and can be used for indoor hospitality when it reopens later this month.\nThe Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin and senior ministers have said that Irish passport holders in Northern Ireland will be able to access the DCC, but they have yet to indicate how they will be able to do so.\nMinisters have said that official proof of vaccination in Northern Ireland will be acceptable for indoor hospitality in the Republic, but it is advisable to have other official proof of identity with a photograph such as a driving licence as a support document for indoor service in pubs and restaurants.\nT\u00e1naiste (deputy PM) Leo Varadkar has said it is hoped new laws, which will allow indoor hospitality to reopen will take effect next week, but not later than 26 July.\nThose vaccinated in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the United States are to be permitted entry to bars and restaurants if they have verifiable proof of vaccination.\nMr Varadkar cautioned that nightclubs can operate as licensed venues with table service, but will not be allowed to operate in their traditional form for \"quite some time\".\nTourism Minister Catherine Martin said there would be fines of up to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a32,125) for the use of forged documents to gain entry to venues.\nThe announcement had been expected and was welcomed by the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) which said a mammoth amount of work had happened behind the scenes to draft the legislation.\nThe EU's digital Covid certificate is being rolled out across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\nEU citizens (and those of Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), can download it or obtain a paper copy - at no cost."

      "tags": "Transport,COP26,Climate change,Environment,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "You can carry on flying, the government has told the British public, as it outlines its plan to reduce transport emissions to virtually zero by 2050.\nMinisters say new technology will allow domestic flights to be almost emissions-free by 2040, and international aviation to be near zero-carbon by mid-century.\nThe policy has been ridiculed by environmentalists, who say the government is putting far too much faith in innovation.\nThey say demand for flying and driving must be curbed if the UK is to meet its ambitious climate targets.\nThe comments on aviation form part of the government\u2019s Transport Decarbonisation Strategy, announced on Wednesday.\nTransport is responsible for 27% of the UK's emissions, making it the single biggest emitting sector. Before the pandemic, flying made up about 7% of overall emissions. \nThe government has pledged the entire economy will be virtually zero-carbon by mid-century and is relying on new technology to play a significant role in achieving that, especially in aviation. \n\"It's not about stopping people doing things: it's about doing the same things differently,\" said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\n\"We will still fly on holiday, but in more efficient aircraft, using sustainable fuel. We will still drive, but increasingly in zero-emission cars.\"\nHe told the BBC's Today Programme that progress towards low-carbon flying was further advanced than people realised.\n\"We already have electric aircraft, going up in the air, and in fact the UK has become the first country in the world to have a hydrogen aircraft flying as well,\" he said.\n\"In addition to those advanced technologies, we also have things like sustainable aviation fuel.\"\nMr Shapps said the government planned to use sustainable fuel to fly home some participants in November's COP26 conference.\nHowever, critics say reductions in emissions will not be achievable without reducing the amount we fly.\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas described the government's approach to aviation as \"a flight of fantasy\" that relied on technology that was still being developed. \n\"The government should not hoodwink us,\" she told the BBC.\nMr Shapps said a bigger problem was road transport, which contributes 90% of transport-related carbon emissions in the UK, but that he felt progress was being made.\n\"I think we're reaching that tipping point. When you switch on the television or or see an internet ad, you'll see that electric cars and hybrid cars are almost exclusively the ones being advertised right now,\" he said.\nThe government has already said that sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK from 2030.\nThe transport plan says all new lorries will be zero-carbon by 2040, running on batteries or hydrogen under a world-leading UK policy. \nA recent study showed that trucks accounted for 2% of vehicles in the EU, but 22% of road transport emissions.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the government's proposals on lorries were speculative, unrealistic and potentially damaging to business.\n\"These alternative HGVs don't yet exist - we don't know when they will and what they will cost,\" said RHA chief executive Richard Burnett.\n\"For many haulage companies, there are fears around cost of new vehicles and a collapse in resale value of existing lorries. The problem is even worse for coaches, which are more expensive to buy and have longer lifecycles.\"\nThe government's transport decarbonisation plan also says:\nHowever, critics said the plans did not go far enough.\nKerry McCarthy MP, Labour\u2019s shadow transport minister, said: \u201cThis plan has been a long time coming, but it was barely worth the wait.\n\"The government is still stalling when it comes to the tough decisions needed,\" she added, citing the rise in rail fares and the cut in plug-in car grants. \n\u201cAt a time when we should be showing global leadership and pressing ahead with this agenda, it's clear ministers still have a long way to go.\u201d\nThe Green Party's Ms Lucas said that it was \"a missed opportunity to really rethink how we organise how we travel\".\nGreen groups said problem areas remained such as:\nThe government has been discussing a proposal to work with employers on \u201cCommute Zero\u201d - a project that could encourage more lift-sharing and working from home.\nMinisters have also agreed that the whole central government fleet of 40,000 cars and vans should be fully zero-emission by 2027.\nHowever, the Treasury will face difficult choices, as revenue streams shift as a result of the zero-carbon strategy.\nCurrently, the Treasury receives more than \u00a330bn a year from fuel taxes on conventional cars. \nOne alternative could be a pay-as-you-drive tax, but a government spokeswoman told BBC News there were no plans at present to introduce road pricing.\nShe also said there were no plans for a frequent flyer levy. \nWhere transport policy is devolved, the plan applies just to England only. Where policy is reserved, this will apply to the UK as a whole and the UK government will consult with the UK nations."

      "text": "Some Hungary fans booed as England players took the knee ahead of Tuesday's World Cup qualifier at Wembley.\nAbout 1,000 supporters clashed with police, and one fan was arrested. Fifa \"strongly condemned\" the incident. \nTaking the knee has spread across the sporting world as a statement against racism, but has proved controversial. \nThe practice of taking the knee before football matches became widespread in 2020, following the murder of George Floyd in the US.\nBefore Euro 2020 competition began, the England manager Gareth Southgate said his players would take the knee throughout the tournament.\nA number of other teams also took the knee before some or all of their matches, including Scotland, Wales, Belgium, Portugal and Switzerland.\nIn advance of the competition, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that she did not support \"people participating in that type of gesture politics\". Asked if she would criticise fans who booed England players taking the knee, she said: \"That's a choice for them, quite frankly\".\nAfter they missed penalties in the final, which England lost, Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were racially abused.\nMs Patel tweeted that she was disgusted they had been subjected to \"vile racist abuse\".\nBut England football player Tyrone Mings accused the home secretary of hypocrisy on Twitter. \nSeveral Conservative politicians have said they oppose kneeling because they see it as a political statement.\nThen Education Minister Gillian Keegan said taking the knee was \"creating division\".\nRather than demonstrating opposition to racism and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, it has been argued that kneeling actually shows support for a campaigning organisation also called Black Lives Matter.\nBut Gareth Southgate said the England team's actions were not in support of the Black Lives Matter organisation. He said: \"We have got a situation where some people seem to think it is a political stand that they don't agree with. That is not the reason the players are doing it. We are supporting each other.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said people should be \"free to show... how much they condemn racism in any way they choose\". But he was criticised by Labour for stopping short of condemning fans who booed the England team.\nAmerican footballer Colin Kaepernick took the knee during the national anthem before a match in 2016. He said he could not stand to show pride in the flag of a country that oppressed black people.\nThe anti-racist statement has since become a prominent symbol in sport and during protests. \nIt has also been a feature of Black Lives Matter protests, including those following the murder of George Floyd.\nThe IOC - which organises the Games - initially banned competitors from taking the knee. It said Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter forbids any kind of \"demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda\".\nBut it then decided to lift the ban, allowing athletes to \"express their views\" before and after competing. This meant they could take the knee before an event.\nHowever, they could not express their views during events and victory ceremonies, or at the Olympic Village. Any protest should not be \"disruptive\", including unfurling a flag or banner during \"the introduction of another athlete or team\".\nTeam GB's women's football players took the knee before every match during the Olympics to highlight the racial abuse directed at England's men's team after the Euro 2020 competition. \nFemale footballers from Chile and Japan also took the knee, as did Costa Rican gymnast Luciana Alvarado.

      "tags": "UK banking,Personal finance,Housing market,UK economy,Mortgages,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some of Britain's biggest high street banks are refusing to give mortgages to self-employed people who received government grants during the pandemic.\nMortgage brokers say those working in sectors like entertainment, hospitality and travel are the worst affected.\nMany lenders spoken to by the BBC are not accepting mortgage applications from people on furlough.\nBrokers said that banks often see people who have received Covid-related grants as high risk.\n\"I almost feel like I am being treated like a bankrupt, in some way, that I am being penalised for something that wasn't my fault,\" said hospitality worker Lisa Harding. \nMs Harding, 49, is a first time buyer with a 10% deposit. She said she is unable to get a mortgage because she was previously furloughed from her job in the hospitality industry. \nShe has now returned to her permanent, full-time job, but has still been turned down by lenders.\n\"I feel unfairly penalised. Furlough has been brilliant in that it has protected my job. But I didn't expect to come out of the other side - with a deposit, no debt, a perfect credit rating, all of the things that should make me an ideal first time buyer - only to find out that banks just will not lend to me at all,\" Ms Harding told the BBC.\nTwo of the UK's biggest high street lenders, NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland, are refusing mortgage applications from people who took the government's self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) grant.\n\"As it stands we aren't accepting applications from customers who have applied for a SEISS grant on or after 14 July 2020,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \n\"As a responsible lender this is part of the bank's affordability criteria,\" they said. \nYorkshire Building Society and TSB said they would need to see evidence of the businesses having recovered from the pandemic, such as a good turnover. \nLenders traditionally look at the last two years of accounts to work out how much was earned. This means the Covid pandemic could still be impacting self-employed peoples' mortgage applications until 2023.\nSelf-employed people are also being asked to stump up larger deposits. Metro Bank, for example, said any customers who have taken out an SEISS grant will need a deposit of 20% or more. At Santander a deposit of 25% is the minimum for those who are self-employed.\nMost of the lenders the BBC contacted, including Lloyds, Yorkshire Building Society, TSB and Virgin Money, said they will not accept mortgage applications from people currently on furlough. They also do not include furloughed income as part of their affordability assessment.\nAndrew Montlake, a broker at Coreco, said those working in hospitality, tourism and events will face these challenges for \"some time\" and that lenders need to be more \"proactive.\" \n\"We are calling on lenders to look at how businesses were performing before the pandemic, as a more likely guide for how they will perform afterwards.\"\nSome of these policies go against assurances from the Financial Conduct Authority, the banking watchdog. \nAn FCA spokesperson said the SEISS grant or support of this kind \"should not, of themselves, prevent people from being able to access credit.\"\n\"Lenders are required to treat customers fairly when they apply for a mortgage,\" the spokesperson added. \nThere are concerns that millions of people who took advantage of the Covid support schemes did not fully understood the long-term impact.\nFreelance theatre designer Daniel Ellis was also shocked to find he was not eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out an SEISS grant.  \nThe 28-year-old has been saving to buy his first home with his wife Emily in Derby. The couple's prospective monthly mortgage payments would be a third less than what they are currently paying each month in rent. \nBut his bank, NatWest, told him he wasn't eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out the grant when theatres were forced to close. \n\"The mortgage system needs to change to reflect evidence of successful recurring rent payments, and we also feel it's wrong that the self-employed are scrutinised more than the employed,\" Mr Ellis explained. \nThe couple say they have, with difficulty, managed to secure a mortgage in principle with another lender.\nConsumer groups, including Fairer Finance, are now calling on the financial regulator to urgently investigate which lenders are penalising borrowers in this way and to take action.\nAccording to data from the Office for National Statistics, there are currently just over five million self-employed workers in the UK. \nAlmost 60% of self-employed borrowers said they felt penalised by lenders because they worked for themselves when applying for a mortgage, according to a survey carried out by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-employed (IPSE). \nMore than two-thirds of freelancers (70%) who had got a mortgage said some lenders would not consider them at all because they are self-employed.\nUK Finance, which represents the industry, said lenders must carry out a thorough income check to ensure mortgages are affordable in the long term.\n\"Each lender will consider a range of factors such as the type of borrower, their employment status, income history, the sector they work in and the type of property they are looking to purchase when deciding how much to lend,\" a UK Finance spokesperson said.\nThe Treasury told the BBC that its \u00a3350bn financial package had supported jobs and livelihoods throughout this crisis. \n\"It's important that lenders are able to carry out proper checks to ensure people are not offered unaffordable loans,\" a Treasury spokesperson said."

      "text": "Face masks will continue to be required by law in some settings in Wales as long as Covid remains a threat.\nThe Welsh government has said face coverings in Wales would still be mandatory on public transport and in health and social care settings.\nMinisters are undecided if wearing masks will continue to be law in shops.\nWales' health minister said Wales will look different to England after 19 July where face masks and social distancing will not be law in most settings.\nThe Welsh government's next 21-day review of the coronavirus regulations is due to take place on Wednesday.\nIt has been under pressure to announce a date for ending Covid restrictions after England announced its so-called 'freedom date' of 19 July, and Scotland said it planed to lift remaining legal restrictions on 9 August.\nThe Welsh government, which has taken a \"cautious approach\" to  easing rules, had said Wednesday's review would \"set out whether restrictions can be relaxed in some indoor places, including people's homes\".\n\"We will need everyone's help to keep coronavirus under control as we continue to respond to the pandemic - this virus has quite certainly not gone away,\" said Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford.\n\"We know many people are still worried and anxious about going out. We will maintain the requirement to wear face coverings in certain places - on public transport and health and social care settings, and others where necessary - to help keep us all safe.\"\nWelsh ministers have already told school pupils that wearing face coverings in the classroom will no longer be recommended from September.\nNow travel agents and tour operators have called for Wales to follow English rules and allow double-jabbed residents returning from amber list countries to return home without the need to quarantine.\nWales is currently at alert level one in its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which means face coverings are mandatory in all indoor public places.\nMinisters in Cardiff are expected to publish an updated Coronavirus Control Plan this week, setting out what will happen once Wales moves into alert level zero.\nThe Welsh government said if Wales moved from alert level one to zero, its lowest level of Covid restrictions, face coverings would still be mandatory on buses, trains and taxis and in settings such as doctor's surgeries, hospitals dentists and opticians.\nWales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said that wearing face masks is an \"effective way of reducing the transmission of coronavirus\".\nShe added: \"We are absolutely clear that this will be a necessity in areas where people don't have any choice but to travel on public transport, there's enclosed places with not very obvious ventilation methods and therefore these are obvious places for us to focus.\n\"We are still discussing whether we need to go further and whether we want to introduce this also at retail level. We all have a duty to help to protect each other.\"\nMs Morgan said things will look very different in Wales compared to England on 19 July, but added there is a prospect for some relaxation later in the summer.\nWales has seen the lowest coronavirus infection rate of any of the UK nations but the 127 cases per 100,000 people rate has risen from less than 10 since the end of May due to the emergence of the Delta variant in Wales.\nThe latest Public Health Wales figures released on Sunday showed a further 698 people have tested positive for Covid in the 24 hours up to 09:00 on Friday but there were no further deaths.\nAll but two of Wales' 22 council areas recorded cases in double figures with the most in Wrexham (94) and Cardiff (73) compared with three in Monmouthshire and seven in Pembrokeshire.\nWales has one of the world's highest vaccination rates - with 72% of the population having one jab and almost 58% having both doses - and is best of the UK nations.\nPublic Health Wales data shows there have been 5,579 Covid-related deaths since the pandemic began while there have been 224,501 cases in total.\nAndrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservatives leader in the Senedd, said: \"Let's not forget that Wales has the highest death rate of any country of the United Kingdom and it was only this time last year that the Welsh government were viciously and vocally arguing against the use of face masks.\n\"It does seem as if they are just trying to get ahead of a press conference that the UK prime minister is going to be doing tomorrow rather than actually any informed decision making which we expect in Wales on Wednesday.\"\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party \"welcomes the Welsh government's sensible decision to require the continued use of face coverings in certain settings as case numbers remain high\".\nMr ap Iorwerth called for consistency in the enforcement of rules in different settings, including on trains and in schools."

      "text": "Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nThe move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed.\nMs Sturgeon said \"sensible precautions\" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues.\nShe said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.\nMinisters also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point.\nMs Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate.\nAnd fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival.\nHowever, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place \"for some time\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them.\n\"And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings.\"\nScotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had \"levelled off\", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses.\nShe said \"a gradual approach\" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life.\nNicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said \"I will always err on the side of going more cautiously\". \nEngland is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option \"for good headlines\".\nA statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.\nDespite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned.\nAn obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings.\nWhile laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here \"for as long as necessary\". \nIt feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go.\nThe move to level zero means: \nPlans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers:\nMs Sturgeon said the move was \"not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions\", but it said it \"does restore yet more freedom to all of us\".\nBusiness groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering their plans.\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said firms \"will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nAnd the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives\".\nHe said: \"The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver.\"\nLabour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said \"inconsistent decision making and communications\" was hitting the response to the pandemic.\nHe said: \"The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic.\"\nScottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had \"concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high\", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging.\nAnd outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made \"urgently\", with \"thousands of key workers\" having to quarantine despite testing negative."

This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment.

Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

Though officials say serious cases, including the number of people being hospitalised, remain relatively low.\nThe surge in cases, however, has prompted new Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's government into a partial rethink. \nUnder what it calls a \"soft suppression\" approach, Israelis will be asked to learn to live with Covid.\nCurbs being reinstated include the mandatory wearing of face masks indoors and quarantine for all people arriving in Israel.\nWith vaccinations rising and cases dropping, the Netherlands pushed ahead with its reopening in late June. Face masks were abandoned in almost all places and young people were encouraged to go out again.\nSince then, cases have soared, jumping to their highest levels since December - although the relaxation has not led to a notable rise in hospital admissions.\nAs criticism from health officials grew louder, Prime Minister Mark Rutte was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on Friday and re-imposed many restrictions, just two weeks after the measures were lifted.\nRestaurants and bars were forced to close from midnight, while nightclubs were shut again, as Mr Rutte apologised for his \"poor judgement\".\n\"What we thought would be possible, turned out not to be possible in practice,\" he admitted.\nThe Dutch government's website says the measures will remain in place until at least 13 August.\nHailed as a success story in its handling of Covid-19, South Korea was one of the first East Asian countries to chart a path out of the pandemic.\nIn June it announced plans to allow vaccinated people to go mask-free outdoors, permit small private gatherings and relax restaurant opening times.\nBut experts warned South Korea was dropping its guard against the coronavirus too soon, with the majority of the population still unvaccinated.\nNow it is facing its worst-ever coronavirus outbreak. \nA record-breaking daily tally of cases has forced the government to tighten social-distancing rules across most of the country. In the capital, Seoul, residents have been banned from meeting more than one other person after 18:00.\nWith the Delta variant spreading fast and its vaccination rate slowing, public confidence in South Korea's ability to cope with coronavirus has taken a knock.\nUnlike most countries, Sweden has relied mainly on voluntary measures to stem the spread of infections, though curbs on opening hours for restaurants and limits on crowds at venues have also been implemented.\nSome of those restrictions have already been loosened, with 3,000 seated spectators allowed at sports stadiums and the rules on opening hours scrapped on 1 July. More restrictions are being dropped on 15 July.\nSince the spring, cases have continued to fall steeply, something credited to rising vaccinations and warmer weather, meaning people are spending more time outdoors. \nBut amid worries about the rise of the Delta variant, most travellers returning to Sweden will need to be tested for Covid-19.\nFor most of the past year, Australians had enjoyed life with few restrictions. Face masks weren't required as the country consistently recorded days when no Covid cases were found at all.\nWhen there were outbreaks, authorities launched snap lockdowns to bring case rates back to zero. For example, Perth shut down for five days in January over the detection of a single case. \nBut an outbreak of the Delta strain in Sydney mid-June has plunged the nation's largest city back into lockdown. That is expected to last until the end of July at least. \nThe city is currently fighting more than 100 cases a day. The virus spread quickly - even in the first weeks of lockdown - in a city unused to restrictions. Officials said people were exploiting stay-at-home rules. These have been tightened since.\nBut with more than 90% of the population unvaccinated, officials say a return to normality will take some time. A lack of vaccine supplies, specifically of Pfizer, mean many Australians won't be able to get a jab until the final months of the year.\nAs the Joe Biden administration forged ahead in its vaccine drive, many states began lifting restrictions, ditching mask mandates and allowing businesses to reopen. \nIn June, California - the US's most populous state - announced its \"grand reopening\", while New York lifted nearly all restrictions as its vaccination rate passed 70%.\nOverall, cases have remained low. New infections are less than one-tenth of the average daily rate at the height of the pandemic in January, even as they have doubled in the last two weeks.\nBut there are growing concerns about the Delta variant that has been surging in some under-vaccinated states. As the vaccine rate slows, some states are recommending residents keep wearing masks because of worries over the more infectious strain.\nIn New York City, cases have jumped by almost a third in a week, with some of the highest rises in neighbourhoods with the lowest vaccine rates. \nDeaths are creeping up, but not as sharply as cases. State officials say the overwhelming majority of people now hospitalised with Covid-19 are unvaccinated."

      "tags": "Transport for London,City of London,Sadiq Khan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Face coverings must be worn on London's transport network despite restrictions easing on 19 July, London's mayor says.\nSadiq Khan said he was not prepared to put Tube, bus and other transport users at risk by relaxing the rules on face coverings.\nFace masks have been mandatory on public transport for the past year to reduce the spread of the virus.\nBut those rules will be replaced with government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services.\nEngland is removing most of its Covid restrictions next Monday, and while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he expects masks to be worn in crowded places, such as on a busy Tube train, their use will no longer be compulsory.\nLondon was the first English city to insist on face coverings after Covid restrictions ease. \nOther metro mayors have also joined calls for masks to be worn on public transport.\nIn Scotland, the mandatory use of face coverings will remain in place for \"some time\", First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said, even after the country eases most of its other restrictions on 19 July.  \nThe rules for masks apply in shops and public transport - as well as pubs and restaurants when not seated.\nIn Wales, masks will continue to be required by law in some settings. The Welsh government has said face coverings would still be mandatory on public transport and in health and social care settings.\nMr Khan has made face masks a condition of carriage for the Tube, bus, tram, DLR, Overground and TfL Rail. \nThis means that, despite the easing of restrictions on 19 July, it will be listed as a condition in a legal agreement between Transport for London (TfL) and its customers.\nFace coverings will also be required in taxis and private hire vehicles by both drivers and passengers unless they are exempt.\nMr Khan said: \"We know from the government's own advisors and from the World Health Organisation, that wearing a face covering indoors does reduce transmissions.\n\"It leads to greater public safety and greater public confidence as well.\n\"As long as the virus is still with us, and as long as we're still concerned about the virus being transmitted, we will make it compulsory.\"\nHe said he was \"confident you will see from Monday high levels of the rules being followed just like there have been since last June\".\nTfL's 400 enforcement officers will deny those without a face covering from using London transport, under the plan.\nTfL staff and bus drivers will continue to remind passengers that masks are a requirement, Mr Khan said. \nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has said he will not '\"rule out\" mandating face masks on public transport.\nMr Burnham told the BBC he had not yet taken the decision to mandate masks on trams in Manchester and wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion.\nThe reaction from commuters has been pretty unanimous - the message over masks is mixed and confusing. \nNow, for example, at many merged stations in London - like Barking, Richmond, Wimbledon & Shepherd's Bush - you could go from a rail service where masks are personal choice, to a TfL service where they are a condition of carriage. \nSometimes different services even use the same the platform. \nSo you'll have to become very adept at differentiating a TfL rail service from a national rail one. \nFor an industry that is trying to become more uniform, standardised and is meant to be about making fares and interchanges easier, it's a complete mess. \nThe rail industry says masks will put people off using public transport - polling in London says the opposite. \nThe question now is, will other mayors and train operators follow London's example? \nOr could a simple single rule for all public transport emerge, even at this late stage?\nA poll from the travel watchdog TransportFocus found 56% of Londoners said say they will not use public transport \"unless passengers are required to wear a face covering\".\nThe legal requirement to wear a face covering in shops, public transport and other enclosed public spaces will end on 19 July. It will be replaced with government guidance. \nA government spokeswoman stressed there would be a shift from \"universal government diktat to relying on people's personal responsibility\".\n\"The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they don't normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces,\" she said.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the rules were \"just common sense when you think about it\" as \"you would be in a crowded area\" on London transport.\nLabour has said it is \"irresponsible\" to drop the legal requirement to wear masks.\nThe move has been welcomed by the RMT union, which represents rail workers. It said the approach was consistent with the rules that are currently in place in Scotland, Wales and on Eurostar services to the continent.\nHowever, it said: \"We now have the ludicrous position where a passenger travelling through London will have different rules on the Tube and the mainline services.\"\nMr Shapps said: \"We've seen lots of these rules being different in different parts of the UK.\n\"The same way you can't drink alcohol on London transport systems, but you can on some long distance journeys.\"\nFrom 2 May to 29 May 2021, 86% of TfL customers said they were wearing face coverings at all times on public transport. \nOf the 14% not wearing a face covering at all times or not at all, almost three-quarters (74%) claim to have an exemption or good reason under the current regulations for not doing so, TfL research shows.\nAndy Byford, London's Transport Commissioner, said: \"The transport network is cleaner than ever, with an enhanced cleaning regime, hospital grade cleaning products, widely-available hand sanitizer and UV light fittings on escalator handrails to kill viruses. \n\"It is great news that regular independent testing for the virus by Imperial College has found no trace on our services, and we are now ready to safely welcome back more and more customers from 19 July as people head out to enjoy all that the capital has to offer.\""

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Housing market,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "House prices have risen sharply across the UK, driven by an increase of more than 15% in the year to May in the North West of England.\nOfficial figures show property prices also rose at a rapid rate in Scotland, Wales and the North East of England.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the average UK home cost \u00a3255,000 in May.\nThat was \u00a323,000 more than the typical value a year earlier. The 10% rise was the fastest rate for 14 years.\nDetached and terraced homes recorded the biggest price increases, data from the Land Registry in England and Wales show.\nEstate agents have reported huge demand from property buyers during the year so far.\nThis picked up when many buyers wanted to complete their purchases before stamp duty holidays were wound down. In May, the tax breaks were still in place for England, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nHowever, that it not the only explanation for rising prices. Scotland's property tax break was withdrawn at the end of March.\nPeople's changing priorities as a result of the pandemic mean they are looking for bigger homes in which to live and work.\nA lack of homes being put on the market to match demand has also led to rising prices. A majority of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members think prices will continue to rise over the next year for that reason.\n\"The market was being powered by ultra-low mortgage rates, valuable stamp duty savings and people rethinking what they want from their homes due to the pandemic,\" said Katie Cave, director at mortgage broker Clearpoint Finance.\n\"Demand was as rampant as supply was weak, which sent prices skywards.\"\nThe ONS said that house prices in the UK rose by 10% in the year to May.\nThe North West was the region with the highest annual house price growth, with average prices increasing by 15.2%.\nThere were also big rises in Wales (up 13.3%), Scotland (up 12.1%) and the North East of England (up 11.8%).\nAt the other end of the scale, London recorded the slowest property price rise over the year, of 5.2%.\nGed McPartlin, managing director of Ascend Properties, said: \"It's clear that the north-south divide has never been wider.\n\"While this momentous rate of price growth must inevitably slow at some point, we expect this vast difference in property pedigree to remain as buyers in the north continue to benefit from a far more affordable market with, or without, the benefit of a stamp duty saving.\"\nIn Wales, terraced houses rose in price by 15.2% over the same period.\nThat was the fastest rise of any property type, which was mirrored in England, where the value of terraced homes went up by 11.2%.\nThis was closely followed by a 14% rise in the cost of detached homes in Wales, and an 11% increase in England.\nProperties with gardens have proved popular among buyers looking for space inside and outside homes."

Sadly, here's another example of a government snub,\" he said.\nAlthough most businesses are now allowed to trade, under current restrictions they must do so under social-distancing laws.\nThese apply to pubs, cafes and restaurants and the sector has lobbied for them to be scrapped.\nNightclubs remain closed in Wales, while organisers of large events are waiting to find out if they can take place.\nLegal limits on numbers that can meet outdoors remain in Wales, while meetings in private homes are currently restricted to those who are in extended household groups."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nIbiza, Majorca and Menorca are being moved onto the government's amber travel list from 04:00 BST on Monday, just over a fortnight after they were moved onto the green watchlist. The announcement applies to England, but the other UK nations are expected to follow suit. From Monday, those not double-jabbed or under 18 have to quarantine on returning from an amber list country. Travellers will still have to follow the rules at their destination - here is a look at the entry requirements for some popular holiday hotspots.\nWe heard this morning that masks are to be made compulsory on London transport after face coverings cease to be compulsory on 19 July in England. Now five of England's metro mayors are calling for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after rules change on Monday. Face coverings will stay compulsory in areas they have control over, like Manchester's trams and West Yorkshire bus stations. Train operator Greater Anglia also says it will continue to ask passengers to wear face coverings. Meanwhile, Waterstones says it will encourage its customers to continue wearing face coverings in its stores. It is one of the first major chains to state a firm policy on mask wearing.\nHospitals in the north-east of England are facing a new surge of Covid cases. Dr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees says: \"It's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital.\" The hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care - the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week. Stockton resident Sandra Forsyth says she regretted not getting vaccinated when she contracted Covid.\nMost Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August, the Welsh government says. Nightclubs could resume trading, and social-distancing laws inside will be replaced with a requirement for workplaces to assess the risk. Face masks will still be required in most indoor public places, except in hospitality businesses, such as pubs and restaurants, or schools.

      "tags": "Social media,Social media regulation debate",
      "text": "Once again, social-media companies are facing criticism as their platforms are used to racially abuse football players, following the dramatic conclusion of the Euro 2020 men's tournament on Sunday night.\nAnd make no mistake, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the technology giants to defend these incidents. How can they not be held more responsible for the content they share to millions?\nIn a nutshell, social-media platforms have not been regulated in the same way as traditional media such as the BBC, because they are not categorised as publishers or broadcasters.\nIf racist comments appeared below this article, written not by me but by someone who had read it, the BBC would be immediately accountable, as part of an arrangement with the regulator Ofcom.\nBut Ofcom does not yet have powers over the likes of Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter, which have until now been largely self-regulating - although, that is coming, as part of the long-anticipated Online Safety Bill. \nWhether the threat of large fines is enough to focus the minds of these multi-million dollar businesses remains to be seen, however. But it is not just in the UK that regulation is planned.\nIn fairness, while the BBC does have a large global presence, it does not have to deal with anything like the volume of content and video, written and uploaded in real time by anybody and everybody, a platform such as Facebook, with its two billion users, does. \nThis sheer volume swamps the armies of human moderators employed by those platforms.\nSome describe nightmare shifts sifting through the worst and most graphic content imaginable and then making decisions about what should be done with it. \nSo, the solution these companies are all pouring countless time and money into is automation. \nAlgorithms trained to seek out offensive material before it is published, the blanket banning of incendiary (and illegal) hashtags, the use of techniques such as \"hashing\", which create a kind of digital fingerprint of a video, and then block any content bearing the same marker, are already in regular use.\nBut so far, automation remains a bit of a blunt instrument. \nIt is not yet sophisticated enough to understand nuance, context, different cultural norms, crafty edits - and there would be very little support for an anonymous algorithm, built by an unelected US technology giant, effectively censoring Western people's speech without these factors (China of course has its own state censorship and US social-media platforms are banned).\nHere is an example - a friend last night reported an anonymous account that had posted an orangutan emoji beneath an Instagram post belonging to England's Bukayo Saka. \nNow, nobody is going to blanket-ban that emoji. \nBut in this context, and given Saka is a young black player whose penalty kick was one of those that failed in the deciding moments of the England v Italy Euro 2020 final, the intention is pretty clear.\nThe response my friend received to her complaint was: \"Our technology has found that this probably doesn't go against our community guidelines,\" - although, it went on to add the automation \"isn't perfect\".\nShe has appealed against the decision but who knows when it will get a pair of human eyes on it?\nOn Twitter, meanwhile, a user was apparently able to use an extremely offensive racial slur in a tweet about a footballer, before deleting the message.\nIn a statement, Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it had \"quickly removed comments\" directed at players.\n\"No-one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere - and we don't want it on Instagram,\" it said.\nTwitter's response was similar - in 24 hours, it had removed 1,000 posts and blocked accounts sharing hateful content, using \"a combination of machine learning based automation and human review\", it said.\nBoth companies also said they had tools and filters that could be activated to stop account holders from seeing abusive content - but this does not solve the problem of the content being shared in the first place.\n\"No one thing will fix this challenge overnight,\" Facebook added.\nAnd perhaps that is what really lies at the heart of all this - it is not necessarily the limitations of technology that are the issue but old-fashioned human nature. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said, on Twitter ironically, those responsible for posting racist abuse should \"be ashamed of themselves\".\nBut for some people, there is something seemingly irresistible about hiding behind a keyboard and saying things they would in all likelihood never say out loud, in person. \nNever before have people had access not only to those they want to berate but also a potentially enormous audience of those who will listen - and join in. \nFor some, it has proved a heady and intoxicating mix - and one that has quickly established itself as the norm.\nI was talking to someone recently about something controversial that happened 20 years ago. \nHer first question was about how social-media had responded.\nI hesitated for a moment, wondering why I could not remember that detail - and then realised it was simply because it did not exist."

      "text": "Large businesses have said they will maintain a cautious approach to bringing staff back to the office despite the lifting of final Covid restrictions in England on Monday.\nThe government announced yesterday that it will no longer instruct people to work at home from 19 July.\nBut firms spoken to by the BBC said they did not plan to bring all staff back to the office.\nMany businesses said they will opt for a staggered approach for employees. \nDeloitte said it will increase the number of staff allowed to work in its offices to 50% capacity from next week.\nBut the accountancy firm expects that level to stay in place until September.\nNatWest said that it will bring staff back to the office from 19 July but it will only be a small number of \"priority workers\".\nInsurance group Aviva said it expects \"to see more of our people returning\". But a spokesman said that \"the vast majority of people at Aviva want to work flexibly in future\" and employees will combine going into the office with working from home.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that final restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of Covid will be lifted in England from 19 July, including the guidance on office working.\nBut the government said that it \"would expect and recommend a gradual return\" of workers to offices \"over the summer\".\nDeloitte currently operates its offices at 30% capacity and employees have to book desks. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had always intended to take a \"gradual approach\" to moving staff back to its sites.\nIt estimates that it will take between six and eight weeks to prepare its offices to deal with 100% capacity which it expects to reach in September.\nNatWest said a \"very small number of people\" will be invited back to its offices in England from Monday for roles \"that can't really be done from home\". These include market traders as well as people who work in NatWest's treasury department and roles where employees need to meet clients.\nIt also said \"people who would rather work in the office for wellbeing reasons\" can return to its sites from Monday.\nAccountancy firm KPMG has allowed people to work from its offices if they made a request to their manager. \nFrom next week, they will no longer need permission to do so but the firm has also introduced a \"four-day fortnight\" hybrid model of working. It means that KPMG employees spend four days working in the office and the rest of the fortnight either at home or at client sites. \n\"It makes sense that the order to work from home if possible is removed at this stage,\" said Confederation of British Industry policy director, Michael Fell. \"The reality is that many firms are well-advanced in their plans and are proceeding with hybrid working models, just as the government advises. \nRoger Barker, policy director of the Institute of Directors (IoD) industry group, said: \"Businesses across the country will welcome the opportunity to begin to return to relative normality from next week.\"\nHowever, he criticised the government for failing to provide adequate guidance on areas such as wearing face masks which, from Monday, will cease to be mandatory but will be recommended.\nDr Barker said there has been \"real frustration about the mixed messages\" businesses have been receiving from the government. \n\"The latest guidance has shifted the responsibility from the government to businesses by removing mandatory rules on things like face masks and replacing them with voluntary recommendations,\" he said. \"Whilst it is right that companies should be allowed to take decisions based on their own unique circumstances, it is vital that government provides businesses with best practice in developing their own policies.\""

      "tags": "Social media,Online abuse,Racism",
      "text": "Racist abuse directed at black England footballers has intensified calls for stronger action to stamp out hate online.\nMarcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were targeted after they missed penalties in the Euro 2020 final.\nThe government has promised its Online Safety Bill will do more to force social media companies to act. \nThe abuse has also prompted questions about what more can be done elsewhere too. \nThere is already legislation in place in the UK that can be used to prosecute abuse online. \nIn England and Wales, online abuse is covered by two main communication laws dating from 1988 and 2003.\nThe Law Commission, which is reviewing those laws on behalf of the government, says they are ill-suited to the modern nature of internet abuse.\nIt adds that another avenue for prosecution - under public order laws - presents \"real challenges\" as they were not designed to apply online. \nEngland manager Gareth Southgate also says a lot of the abuse received by his players comes from abroad, which makes things even more difficult. \nProsecuting abusers based outside the UK poses legal problems, and can make it much more difficult and time-consuming for police to gather evidence.\nAnd the Commission cautions that the limited resources of police and prosecutors make it impossible to deal with all abuse through the justice system.\nThe government says it will look at the Commission's final recommendations when it reports back later this year.  \nThe government says it wants those found guilty of online racist abuse to be banned from attending football matches. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced the move three days after the Euro 2020 final, after Labour called for the measure. \nCurrently, courts can only ban fans from attending games in the UK for racist chanting at or near a football ground.\nThe three-to-10 year bans also allow authorities to force UK-based fans to hand over their passport to police during matches or tournaments overseas.\nAccording to the Home Office, there were 1,621 in force at the end of last season. Around half were for public or violent disorder.\nSince Sunday's match, over one million people had signed an online petition calling for tougher rules to ban abusers from attending games. \nSome clubs have also enforced bans of their own after fans have been found guilty of sending racist abuse online.\nAnother idea that has occasionally been suggested to deal with online abuse is through court-ordered behaviour orders.\nA range of Criminal Behaviour Orders - which replaced former Anti-social Behaviour Orders or 'Asbos' - can be used to restrict the behaviour of individuals.\nSome have argued that prosecutors could widen their guidance to promote greater use of restrictions on internet use for abusers. \nIn a 2015 report on anti-Semitism, a group of MPs also suggested prevention orders restricting sexual offenders from using the internet could be extended for hate crime offences.\nFacebook, which also owns Instagram, said it had \"quickly removed comments\" directed at players on its platforms. \nTwitter said that it had taken down over 1,000 tweets directed towards England players in 24 hours, and permanently suspended a \"number of accounts\".\nThe firm said this happened after reviews from human moderators, as well as automated technology.\nSocial media companies are responsible for taking content down, and are under pressure do more in this area. \nThe government argues its Online Safety Bill will address this, by giving ministers and regulators greater powers over firms, which up until now have been largely self-regulating.\nOfcom, the body that regulates traditional broadcasters, will be able to issue fines of up to \u00a318m or 10% of global turnover, whichever is higher, if firms fail to comply with the new rules.\nIt would also gain the power to block access to sites in the UK.\nThe government has faced criticism at the time taken for the Online Safety Bill - first conceived by Theresa May's government in April 2019 - to come to fruition.\nAlthough a draft version has been published, it is still undergoing initial scrutiny from MPs and others and is yet to start its journey into law.\nThe bill's passage through Parliament is also likely to be complicated by concerns that some of its provisions could harm freedom of speech. \nLabour says it will push to introduce criminal sanctions for senior executives at tech companies who fail to enforce rules on abuse. \nAnd there has been criticism the bill doesn't do enough to prevent abuse from anonymous users, who are more difficult to identify and punish.\nSome have suggested people should have to provide ID before they are able to open an account. \nBut the government has rejected this, arguing it would \"disproportionately impact\" users such young people exploring their sexual identity and victims of abuse, who rely on anonymity to protect their identity.\nIt said firms would have to stop \"repeat offenders\" from opening new accounts in order to meet their new duty of care.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,John Swinney,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rules on wearing face coverings in Scotland could remain in place until Christmas, the deputy first minister has said.\nJohn Swinney told BBC Scotland it was \"perfectly conceivable\" that masks could still be mandatory in December. \nOn Tuesday, the first minister confirmed mask-wearing would remain for \"some time\" as she announced the move to level zero of Covid restrictions.\nNicola Sturgeon modified planned easing due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nScotland will move to level zero on 19 July which means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained and the return of workers to offices will also be delayed.\nIn an interview on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Mr Swinney was asked if he could envisaged face coverings being mandatory until Christmas.\nHe said: \"I think that's perfectly conceivable. I think that we should recognise that we have got to take a careful and cautious approach to the suppression of Covid.\n\"We know the virus is going to be with us for a long time so the more that we can do, a gradual elementary level to provide obstacles and barriers to the circulation of this virus, the more we should do that.\"\nMr Swinney also revealed Scottish government modelling predicts that Scotland could record between 2,500 and 10,500 new Covid cases on the day restrictions move to level zero.\nHe added: \"I think it is likely to be much closer to that lower end of the spectrum than the higher end.\"\nHe said the impact of the virus was \"moving in the right direction - which means that we can afford some of the relaxation\".\nDevi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she was \"really happy\" to see a continued requirement for face masks.\n\"I know people say it should be 'my choice', but I don't wear a face mask to protect myself, I wear it to protect others,\" she told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme.\n\"If I'm in a shop there could be someone who is immuno-compromised, who is asthmatic, who is elderly - and they will feel safer in that setting if I wear my mask.\"\nProf Sridhar said case numbers in Scotland needed to come down from their current high levels before the wearing of face masks could be dropped.\n\"We're not asking people to wear masks on beaches like in Portugal or outside in parks, like in parts of the United States,\" she told BBC Scotland.\n\"It's really just in workplaces, indoor settings, transport, shops, and it's seen as proportionate to the risks of transmission in those settings.\"\nIt is still hoped that Scotland will move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. A decision on this will be taken next month. \nAmong other announcements in Ms Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood were plans to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate, as long as they have had two doses of vaccine. \nIn addition, fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as long as they take a test after arrival.\nBusiness groups have broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering plans, such as hospitality venues now being required to close at midnight.\nStephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said: \"The midnight curfew is just a made-up time with no evidence to justify it. \n\"It's like Groundhog Day with our warnings about driving people into house parties and other uncontrolled spaces that lack all the precautions you find in responsible pubs, restaurants and hotels.\" \nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe continued wearing of facemasks won the backing of shop worker union Usdaw.\nTracy Gilbert, the union's regional secretary for Scotland, said: \"We ask the public to show their support and respect for shop workers by following the law.\n\"Wearing a face covering in a shop is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job.\""

      "tags": "Brandon Lewis,The Troubles",
      "text": "The government has confirmed it intends to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles.\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to \"draw a line under the Troubles\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Parliament it was a decision not taken lightly.\nSome victims' groups and Stormont's executive parties have expressed opposition to the proposals.\nHowever, Mr Lewis said it was \"the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation\".\nIn his Commons statement, he outlined a \"statute of limitations, to apply equally to all Troubles-related incidents\". \nIt is understood it would apply to former members of the security forces as well as ex-paramilitaries.\nA statute of limitations is a law which prevents legal proceedings being taken after a certain period of time. \nThe plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict.\nThe government's paper makes no mention of what might happen to cases currently before the courts.\nMr Lewis said: \"We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly.\n\"But we have arrived at the view that this would be the best way to facilitate an effective information retrieval and provision process, and the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation. \n\"It is a painful recognition of the reality of where we are.\"\nMr Lewis said that the proposals also include a body to help families recover information on Troubles incidents and an oral history initiative.\n\"Ongoing litigation processes often fail to deliver for families and victims, and their continued presence in a society which is trying to heal from the wounds of its past risks preventing it being able to move forward,\" he said.\nIn terms of \"drawing a line\", this is incredibly far-reaching.\nIt goes beyond a ban on Troubles-era prosecutions, of which there have been just nine in the past six years.\nEnding legacy inquests and civil actions is arguably of greater impact when you consider the figures.\nCurrently, there around 36 inquests relating to the Troubles due to be heard.\nMany of these relate to killings by the Army and police.\nAlongside this, there are more than 1,000 civil claims lodged against the Ministry of Defence and other state agencies.\nThe government is proposing all this is closed down in a new approach which is sweeping in scope.\nHowever, the opposition is loud.\nThe Irish government says it is not a fait accompli or a done deal.\nBut with a big majority at Westminster, the government has set off in a direction of travel which few predict will be reversed. \nNorthern Ireland's five main political parties, the Irish government and several victims' groups have been highly critical of any suggested blanket ban on prosecutions for Troubles-era offences. \nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said a meeting of the Stormont Party Leaders Forum is expected to take place with Mr Lewis on Friday. \nHe said he hoped the parties would use it to express their joint opposition to the proposals.\nEarlier, the prime minister defended the government's plans as \"measured and balanced\".\nBoris Johnson told MPs: \"The sad fact remains that there are many members of the armed services who continue to face the threat of vexatious prosecutions well into their 70s and 80s.\n\"We are finally bringing forward a solution to this problem, to enable the people of Northern Ireland to draw a line under the Troubles and to enable the people of Northern Ireland to move forward.\"\nPrior to the announcement, Northern Ireland's largest cross-community victims' group, Wave, said \"victims and survivors should not be treated this way\". \nIt added that if Mr Lewis \"is serious about effectively dealing with legacy he must talk to those most impacted by pain and trauma\".\nReports that the secretary of state was to announce a plan to end Troubles prosecutions also angered relatives of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings.\nJulie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, was among 21 people killed in the IRA bomb attacks, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to protest against the reported proposal.\n\"At what point did your government lose all sight of its moral, ethical and judicial backbone?\u202f,\" Ms Hambleton's letter asks. \nJohn Teggart, whose father Danny was one of the victims of the Ballymurphy shootings in 1971, said the proposals were a \"slap in the face\" for victims.\n\"It dances on the graves of all our loved ones and all those who affected in the conflict,\" he told BBC News NI's Evening Extra.\nSerena Hamilton, whose father Cpl David Graham was an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier killed by the IRA in Coalisland, County Tyrone, in 1977, said she was \"absolutely disgusted\".\n\"How can you move forward when you haven't got justice in the first place for such heinous crimes that happened to the likes of my father?,\" she asked on Evening Extra.\nLord Dannatt, a former Army chief, who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said the proposals represented the \"least worst option\" and offered families a way to get answers about what happened.\n\"There is now a mechanism where questions can be asked, facts can be ascertained and they will be able to get some degree of closure in knowing what happened because the people answering those questions, whether they're paramilitaries or retired soldiers, will be able to answer those questions truthfully and honestly without the fear of being prosecuted and dragged through the courts.\"\nAmnesty International rejected the proposals as showing an \"appalling and offensive disregard for victims\".\nIts Northern Ireland campaign manager, Grainne Teggart, said: \"Many victims are having their worst fears realised in these proposals, the government is closing down paths to justice.\"\nIan Simpson, from the Northern Ireland Veterans' Association, said \"today is a shameful day\". \nHe continued: \"Today, the veterans and innocent victims have been betrayed to the uttermost by Boris Johnson and the British government.\n\"People who held the line in Northern Ireland, who gave us peace in Northern Ireland, have been put on a pedestal with terrorists, people who went out on a daily basis to murder and to maim.\"\nThe government statement followed significant recent developments in a number of high-profile Troubles prosecution cases.\nIn May, two former paratroopers were acquitted of the 1972 murder of Official IRA man Joe McCann after their trial collapsed due to the inadmissibility of prosecution evidence. \nBoth soldiers had been interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case.\nBut the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible and as the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) did not appeal against that decision, the case could not proceed.\nThen, earlier this month, the McCann murder trial collapse had implications for two other high-profile cases - the Bloody Sunday trial and the prosecution for the murder of 15-year-old Daniel Hegarty.\nThe PPS met the families of Daniel Hegarty and two men killed on Bloody Sunday to explain that given \"related evidential features\" to the McCann case, prosecutors no longer believed there was a reasonable prospect that key evidence against the soldiers accused of their loved one's murders would be ruled admissible.\nThe Bloody Sunday case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but instead it was adjourned following a legal challenge by a brother of one of the men shot dead on Bloody Sunday.

      "tags": "MI5,Spying,China,Russia,Counter-terrorism",
      "text": "The \"toxic\" issue of racism is fuelling a growing threat from the far right, the head of MI5 has warned.\nKen McCallum said MI5 was seeing teenagers as young as 13 drawn into extremist activity, often online.\nBut there was no sign of foreign states trying to sow divisions over race and the UK had to look closer to home to understand the problem, he said. \nHe also urged the public to be as vigilant about threats from \"hostile states\" as from terrorism.\nBut he said MI5 was alert to the possible return of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.\nGiving an overview of of threats facing the UK, Mr McCallum said extreme right wing terrorism was \"sadly here to stay\", with 10 of 29 attack plots disrupted in the last fours years linked to it.\nAnd it was a threat fuelled, in part, by racism, he said.\n\"Racism is a toxic issue that MI5 confronts every day, most visibly in our work to deal with extreme right-wing terrorism. Racism is not the sole and only fuel of that threat, but it is strongly there.\"\nHe said in the past there had sometimes been disinformation campaigns from states abroad seeking to drive wedges on issues such as race but this was not common. \"We don't currently see particular bits of state-generated misinformation as being a major slice of the problem.\"\n\"If we were to find ourselves overly looking to blame abroad for this phenomenon of racism, we might risk not owning a portion of the problem that is ours within our own country,\" he added.\nHe said teenagers were a growing part of counter-terrorist case work, especially with the far right. This was most likely because of the strong online element of the problem, with the youngest person MI5 had come across aged 13. \nMI5 has been focused primarily on Islamist-linked terrorism for the past 20 years since the attacks of 11 September 2001, launched by al-Qaeda from its base in Afghanistan.\nAnd with Western troops now leaving Afghanistan, he acknowledged the potential danger of Islamist terrorist groups trying to rebuild their capabilities there.  \n\"If pockets of ungoverned space open up, some terrorist groups might, for example, try to re-establish some training facilities there as we've seen in the past. It doesn't automatically follow that they would then build from there to try to direct terrorist attacks against the UK, for example, [but] that is clearly a possibility to which we must be alert,\" he said. \nHe said terrorists would be starting from a low base after 20 years of efforts against them but MI5 would now have to shift to a different mode of operation to deal with the threat, similar to the way it dealt with threats from Somalia.\nThe MI5 chief also attacked Facebook and other tech companies for planning to roll out end-to-end encryption for some of its platforms, such as Messenger. This would make it impossible for the companies to hand over the content of users' messages to the authorities because they would no longer have access themselves. \n\"End-to end-encryption done in the way Facebook is currently proposing will hand a gift to the terrorists MI5 has to find and tackle - and a gift to the child abusers our colleagues in the National Crime Agency need to find and tackle,\" he said.\nHe said the tech companies had lived up to their responsibility to remove terrorist content from their platforms. But he said he wanted to make a public plea for them to engage seriously with governments - or him personally - to design in public safety alongside privacy in the future. \nMI5 is doubling the amount of resources it is putting into countering the threats from hostile states, Mr McCallum revealed. These could include disruptive cyber-attacks, misinformation, espionage and interference in politics - and were usually linked to Russia, China and Iran. \nHe said these \"less visible threats\" had \"the potential to affect us all\" by impacting jobs and public services and could even lead to loss of life.\nHe said MI5 had disrupted plans since the Salisbury poisoning of 2018 which might possibly have involved attacking or killing individuals in the UK - but would not provide further details. \nHe confirmed reports that last autumn there had been an episode of Russian generated misinformation or disinformation in respect to the Oxford AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. Attempts to interfere in public life were increasing, he said, although they were not always successful.\nHe talked about the need for new legislation, which is currently being consulted on, to deal with such hostile state activity.\nMr McCallum also extended deepest sympathies to those who lost loved ones in terrorist attacks or state aggression and said MI5 was committed to learning any lessons necessary from events like the attack on Fishmongers' Hall and on the Manchester Arena.\nSpeaking at MI5 headquarters in Thames House, Mr McCallum also said he had cheered on the England football team - apart from for the 90 minutes when they played against Scotland - saying: \"Even for a Scotsman, there was a great deal to like in this England team.\"\nHe said as he watched the penalty shoot-out on Sunday night he felt a parallel with his staff of \"capable, brave young people of all races giving their all for the country\". But he added: \"You don't always win.\""

      "text": "England star Marcus Rashford has said hundreds of people gathering for an anti-racism demonstration at a mural of him has left him \"lost for words\".\nThe work in Withington, where Rashford grew up, was defaced after England lost in the Euro 2020 final, but has been repainted and covered in messages.\nPeople took the knee at the Stand Up to Racism demo at 18:00 BST and speakers addressed the 700-strong crowd.\nThe Manchester United forward said he was \"overwhelmed\" by the response.\nKaren Reismann, 61, who was fined \u00a310,000 for breaching Covid rules during an NHS pay protest, said: \"We all know [that these people think] if they win they are English, if they lose they are black.\"\nFelicite Sora, 35, came to the demo with her five-year-old son Ruben.\nThe NHS worker, who moved to Manchester from Paris six years ago, said she had seen \"the same hate directed when Kylian Mbappe missed the penalty for France on social media\". \n\"It was the same issue for very young black players in France,\" she said.\n\"It's important to support these young people [and] it's important that my son understands he is a beautiful young man whatever happens, like Rashford and Sancho and Saka.\"\nA girl who addressed the crowd said she admired Rashford for having the bravery to take a penalty in the shootout at the end of the final.\n\"I'm not mad at him,\" she said.\n\"I'm just so proud of how he tried.\"\nThe mural was defaced with several swear words shortly after Rashford missed a penalty, along with Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, in the 3-2 shootout loss to Italy on Sunday.\nAll three players have since been targeted with racist abuse on social media.\nGreater Manchester Police said it was investigating a report of racially aggravated damage to the mural and a social media post which was directed at Rashford, Sancho and Saka.\nAssistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes condemned the racist abuse and \"vile behaviour\" which has directed towards the England players.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is to hold a meeting with social media firms regarding taking tougher action over racism. \nWithington Walls co-founder Ed Wellard, who commissioned the artwork, said those responsible for the vandalism should be educated rather than punished.\nA crowdfunding page for the mural has now raised more than \u00a334,000, which Mr Wellard said would be used to fund further pieces.\nRumeana Jahangir, BBC News Online\nOne of the speakers said the rally in a small side street was \"unorthodox\".\nThe area between the more well-known suburbs of Moss Side and Didsbury does not normally attract much attention, but it has become the focus of love for its most famous son.\nParents, children, pastors and even a woman in a Scotland shirt turned out to show vocal support for Rashford and the wider black community.\nIn the 48 hours since Sunday's game, there has been a rollercoaster of emotions locally as the initial anger and upset turned into hope, defiance and love.\nFollow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Masks could stay until Christmas says Swinney",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,John Swinney,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rules on wearing face coverings in Scotland could remain in place until Christmas, the deputy first minister has said.\nJohn Swinney told BBC Scotland it was \"perfectly conceivable\" that masks could still be mandatory in December. \nOn Tuesday, the first minister confirmed mask-wearing would remain for \"some time\" as she announced the move to level zero of Covid restrictions.\nNicola Sturgeon modified planned easing due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nScotland will move to level zero on 19 July which means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained and the return of workers to offices will also be delayed.\nIn an interview on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Mr Swinney was asked if he could envisaged face coverings being mandatory until Christmas.\nHe said: \"I think that's perfectly conceivable. I think that we should recognise that we have got to take a careful and cautious approach to the suppression of Covid.\n\"We know the virus is going to be with us for a long time so the more that we can do, a gradual elementary level to provide obstacles and barriers to the circulation of this virus, the more we should do that.\"\nMr Swinney also revealed Scottish government modelling predicts that Scotland could record between 2,500 and 10,500 new Covid cases on the day restrictions move to level zero.\nHe added: \"I think it is likely to be much closer to that lower end of the spectrum than the higher end.\"\nHe said the impact of the virus was \"moving in the right direction - which means that we can afford some of the relaxation\".\nDevi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she was \"really happy\" to see a continued requirement for face masks.\n\"I know people say it should be 'my choice', but I don't wear a face mask to protect myself, I wear it to protect others,\" she told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme.\n\"If I'm in a shop there could be someone who is immuno-compromised, who is asthmatic, who is elderly - and they will feel safer in that setting if I wear my mask.\"\nProf Sridhar said case numbers in Scotland needed to come down from their current high levels before the wearing of face masks could be dropped.\n\"We're not asking people to wear masks on beaches like in Portugal or outside in parks, like in parts of the United States,\" she told BBC Scotland.\n\"It's really just in workplaces, indoor settings, transport, shops, and it's seen as proportionate to the risks of transmission in those settings.\"\nIt is still hoped that Scotland will move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. A decision on this will be taken next month. \nAmong other announcements in Ms Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood were plans to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate, as long as they have had two doses of vaccine. \nIn addition, fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as long as they take a test after arrival.\nBusiness groups have broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering plans, such as hospitality venues now being required to close at midnight.\nStephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said: \"The midnight curfew is just a made-up time with no evidence to justify it. \n\"It's like Groundhog Day with our warnings about driving people into house parties and other uncontrolled spaces that lack all the precautions you find in responsible pubs, restaurants and hotels.\" \nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe continued wearing of facemasks won the backing of shop worker union Usdaw.\nTracy Gilbert, the union's regional secretary for Scotland, said: \"We ask the public to show their support and respect for shop workers by following the law.\n\"Wearing a face covering in a shop is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job.\""

      "title": "Price rises speed up again as economy unlocks",
      "tags": "Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK inflation rate hit 2.5% in the year to June, the highest for nearly three years, as the unlocking of the UK economy continued.\nThe Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 2.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics said, driven by higher food and fuel costs.\nThe rate is higher than the Bank of England's 2% inflation target for a second month. \nThat will fuel the debate about whether interest rates need to go up.\nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nAs well as food from shops, eating and drinking out also cost more, while clothing and footwear, usually cheaper at this time of year, went up in price instead.\nSecond-hand car prices rose between May and June this year, whereas in recent years, they have fallen between these months, the ONS said.\nSome buyers were reported to have turned to the used car market as a result of delays in the supply of new cars caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production.\nJune's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.2%.\nONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: \"The rise was widespread, for example coming from price increases for food and for second-hand cars, where there are reports of increased demand.  \n\"Some of the increase is from temporary effects, for example, rising fuel prices which continue to increase inflation, but much of this is due to prices recovering from lows earlier in the pandemic. \n\"An increase in prices for clothing and footwear, compared with the normal seasonal pattern of summer sales, also added to the upward pressure this month.\"\nRetail Prices Index (RPI) inflation, an older measure that is still used to calculate certain cost-of-living increases, rose to 3.9% in June, from 3.3% in May.\nThe latest rise in the inflation rate will add to pressure on the Bank of England to consider increasing interest rates to cool the economy.\nThe Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has taken the view that the current inflation surge is \"transitory\" and will fall back after peaking at 3%.\nBut the Bank's departing chief economist, Andy Haldane, warned last month that the risk of high inflation was \"rising fast\" and could reach nearly 4% this year.\nInflation is up again, above target, with prices rising faster than expected across the board in June. Much of this is the result of comparisons with prices that were falling a year ago at the height of the lockdown. Bottlenecks in supply are also driving prices up. For example, car producers can not find microchips, so cannot build enough new cars, so used car prices went up 4.4% in a month. During the pandemic, the microchip market diverted its supply to electronics amid a slump in car sales. \nThere are plenty of examples like this, and the net result is that inflation is heading above 3% in the coming months. This is sufficiently above target to trigger a letter of explanation from the governor of the Bank of England to the chancellor, but don't expect immediate rises in interest rates. \nInflation should peak at this level before falling back to normal, as the economy further reopens. It is, right now, high and rising, but hardly out of control. And the reasons for this global rise are pretty clear: demand rebounding quickly after the pandemic, while supply is taking a little longer to ramp back up.\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sided with the MPC majority view that inflation was likely to reach 3%, but not much higher.\nInterest rates would therefore remain at the current record low of 0.1% \"throughout next year\", he said.\nInflation would \"ease quickly in 2022\", returning to the Bank's 2% target \"in the second half of next year\", he forecast.\nHowever, Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, took Mr Haldane's view that inflation could peak as high as 4% at the end of this year.\n\"We expect it to continue its upward trend over the summer,\" she told the BBC. \"That's largely because of these global supply shortages which have become more acute.\n\"Of course, that's affected everything from semi-conductors to household appliances.\"\nTraders in Willesden Market in north-west London interviewed by the BBC said they were feeling the effects of those supply shortages, with their wholesale costs going up sharply.\nHowever, they added that they were finding it difficult to pass on those costs to their customers, who were unwilling or unable to pay more.\nOne trader said: \"If you try to pass the costs on to the customers, they just don't buy it. Especially at the moment. \n\"No-one's got any money, everyone's skint, everyone's coming back out of lockdown, people have lost their jobs. \n\"I'm earning less, but I'm still going, so I can be thankful for that at the moment.\""

      "title": "Covid-19: Face coverings on London transport and price rises speed up",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nWith just days to go until most Covid restrictions are lifted in England, London public transport bosses have decided to keep one rule mandatory to travel on its network. Face coverings will have to be worn by everyone - unless exemptions apply - when travelling on any vehicle run by Transport for London (TfL). It comes after the government announced the compulsory requirement would be replaced by guidance, which would be an expectation to wear face coverings in crowded places. But London mayor Sadiq Khan has said he is not prepared to put public transport users at risk by relaxing the rules on face coverings, so from 19 July he says it will be a condition of carriage for the Tube, bus, tram, DLR, Overground and TfL Rail. The move by the London mayor reflects that of Wales where masks are required on public transport and in Scotland mandatory use of face coverings will remain in place for \"some time\", and could be in use until Christmas.\nThe UK inflation rate has risen above most economists' forecasts, by hitting 2.5% in the year to June - 0.3% higher than they predicted. Price increases for food, clothing and footwear and the demand for second hand cars have contributed to the rise, which is the highest for nearly three years and comes as the unlocking of the UK economy continues. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 2.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, driven by higher food and energy costs. \"Some of the increase is from temporary effects, for example, rising fuel prices, which continue to increase inflation, but much of this is due to prices recovering from lows earlier in the pandemic,\" says ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics, Jonathan Athow.\nWales is the next nation to reveal what coronavirus restrictions will remain and which ones will be scrapped. An announcement is expected later and comes after England confirmed most restrictions will be lifted on 19 July, the same date Scotland will move to level zero, allowing people to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals but with other rules remaining. Mark Drakeford, the First Minister for Wales, says he will not abandon the rules \"wholesale\". He's not expected to move as fast as the UK government but he should confirm whether Wales can now move to \"alert level one\" - with the easing of some restrictions that had been delayed because of the Delta variant, including allowing six people from any household to meet in private homes.\nAn outbreak of Covid-19 has been confirmed on the Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, following routine testing. There have been about 100 cases on the aircraft carrier, which is part way through a world tour, with several other warships in the fleet accompanying it also affected. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said all crew on the deployment had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and the outbreak was being managed.\nPhotographer Paul Treacy left his staff job and had plans to return to freelancing but the pandemic hit and the country went into lockdown. Work dried up, he didn't qualify for any government assistance and he caught Covid, which turned into long Covid. He talks us through his constitutionals and reveals what he found in pictures.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs face coverings are going to remain in place for anyone travelling on transport in London from 19 July, what is the guidance surrounding them?

      "tags": "Department for Transport,Rail travel,HS2,Welsh government",
      "text": "A cross-party group of MPs has called for HS2 to be reclassified as an England-only project so Wales receives proportional funds. \nThey said the UK government's own analysis concluded the rail project would produce \"an economic dis-benefit to Wales\".\nThe Welsh government called the classification of HS2 as an England and Wales project \"unfair and biased\". \nThe UK government said it had committed \u00a31.5bn to Welsh railways. \nHS2 is a high-speed rail line planned to link London with Birmingham and on to Manchester and Leeds. \nThe multi-billion pound project, which could see costs rise to \u00a3106bn, has been controversial after estimates that the Welsh economy could lose out due to inferior transport infrastructure. \nThe MPs want HS2 to be reclassified as an England-only project despite rail infrastructure not being devolved in Wales beyond the core valleys lines.\nThe Welsh government receives a proportional top-up to the budget when new spending is announced for devolved areas in England which will not apply to Wales, through what is known as \"Barnett consequentials\".\nThe report says while the Welsh government received \"approximately \u00a3755m in Barnett consequentials\" between 2015 and 2019 as a result of the Department for Transport spending money on HS2, it will not receive a proportionate amount because it has been classified by the Treasury as an \"England and Wales project\".\nThis has attracted criticism from the MPs because the rail line will run solely in England. \nThe Welsh Affairs Committee said: \"It is a project of unprecedented size and complexity and has already created several thousand jobs as part of a supply chain that spans the country, including Wales.\" \nBut it said Wales would \"not benefit in the same way as Scotland and Northern Ireland from Barnett consequentials arising from the HS2 project. This is despite the fact that UK government's own analysis has concluded that HS2 will produce an economic dis-benefit for Wales\". \nIt said HS2 could \"yield direct benefits to Welsh rail passengers if it is accompanied by enhancements to the North Wales mainline, including upgrades at Chester and Crewe stations which will be required for full electrification of the North Wales mainline to proceed\".\nThe report also calls for a new Wales Rail Board of Welsh and UK government bodies to identify areas where Welsh railways could be improved and invested in. \nThe MPs also have called on the UK government to bring forward proposals for greater connectivity between Swansea, Cardiff and Bristol by the end of 2021, calling the decision to cancel the electrification of the Cardiff-Swansea mainline \"short-sighted and regrettable\".\nThe group, chaired by Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, said if clear benefits for passengers and freight users could be delivered by transferring powers over rail infrastructure from the UK government to the Welsh government then \"the case for further devolution would be compelling\". \nBut they said \"few benefits to rail users have been identified\" and the benefits of \"existing management arrangements are considerable\".\nThe Welsh government welcomed the calls to \"address unfair and biased categorisation of HS2 as an England and Wales project, which continues to disadvantage rail investment in Wales\". \nA spokesman said their \"long term objective remains full devolution of the rail network and a fair funding settlement for rail infrastructure in Wales\". \nBut they said \"irrespective of where responsibility rests in the short term\" they supported \"close strategic collaboration\" to \"meet passenger needs\" and \"support our decarbonisation commitments\".\nA spokesperson for the UK government's Department for Transport said: \"We have already committed  a record \u00a31.5bn to the Welsh railways in recent years and the recently announced Union Connectivity Review will look at how best to enhance transport links across the United Kingdom to improve connectivity.\" \nThe UK government has argued HS2 will boost reliability, connectivity and capacity on routes across the UK, including services into Wales.

      "text": "The Met Police has denied its policing operation at the Euro 2020 final failed, claiming it had warned Wembley that many ticketless fans were on the way.\nFans fought with stewards and police as they attempted to break through gates for Sunday's England v Italy match at the stadium.\nThe force said police action may have prevented the match being called off.\nPolice and the Football Association are reviewing how the match was handled.\nOne football supporter who got in without a ticket told the BBC that stewards were accepting bribes as fans broke in through a disabled entrance.\nThe man, from Birmingham, said he had joined a social media chat group called \"Wembley Jib\" where between 3,000 and 4,000 people exchanged tactics for breaking into the stadium. \n\"Jibbing\" is football slang for getting in without paying.\nHe said: \"When we got there at 13:00 we were hanging around and a Wembley steward came up asking if we'd got tickets. We said no and he said 'do you want to give me money to get in?'\"\n\"He said it would be \u00a3500 each. I had only taken out \u00a3250 for a bribe.\"\nThe fan claimed that even when people were thrown out of the stadium they were not escorted away and simply tried to get back in.\n\"There were police officers there about 50 in groups of 10. They were standing too far back though, weren't getting involved or were too late if something happened.\"\nThe FA said the majority of the trouble happened in areas that were the responsibility of police.\nThe Met's statement appeared to be aimed at defending itself against suggestions poor policing was to blame for an incident which may threaten Britain's chances of bidding for the 2030 World Cup.\nSources say it is unusual for officers in riot gear to be sent from the start in such large numbers to police a football match.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors said the operation at Wembley was \"one of the most significant and comprehensive policing plans the Met has ever committed to a football match of this scale\".\nShe said: \"Police commanders recognised this could result in ticketless fans attempting to get into the stadium; they updated security officials at Wembley of this risk.\"\nShe added that stewards at the stadium became \"overwhelmed\" soon after the gates opened. \n\"I do not accept that the policing operation failed and I stand by the difficult decisions made by police officers and the Met's public order commanders,\" she said.\n\"Without their immediate intervention, it is possible that this game could have been abandoned.\"\nIn a BBC interview on Tuesday the FA claimed the majority of the trouble was in Wembley Way, outside the stadium, in an area which was the responsibility of the police.\nTwenty-six people have been arrested following events at Wembley and another 25 in central London.\nThe anonymous fan who spoke to the BBC said people were chanting \"jib, jib, jib\" and people were discussing whether to attempt it on Twitter for days before the match.\nHe and friends showed a video on their phones of an e-ticket being verified to stewards to gain access to the outer perimeter.\nThey abandoned an attempt to \"tailgate\" legitimate ticket-holders before pushing their way into the main stadium through a disabled entrance.\n\"The ticketed fans attacked those with no tickets and although once inside it wasn't crowded, there was pushing and squeezing to get in,\" the man added.\n\"If England were in a final and I didn't have a ticket I'd do it again.\"\nIt is likely many of those trying to get access did so because they knew there would be a large number of empty seats due to Covid restrictions."

More than 140 people were killed in such gun-related incidents last year."

      "text": "Doctors and midwives fear next week's relaxation of Covid restrictions will lead to an increase in infections among pregnant women.\nThe warning comes from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM).\nPregnant women can be at greater risk of getting severely ill with Covid.\nSo the experts are urging women to get the Covid vaccine \"to protect yourself, your baby and your family\".\nEvidence shows having the Covid jab is safe during pregnancy.\nThe risk of being very ill with Covid is increaed in the late stage of pregnancy, in part due to the pressure exerted on the lungs by the growing foetus.\nMothers who give birth while infected are more likely to need an emergency Caesarean and had higher rates of stillbirth, although the actual increases remain low.\nThe RCOG told the BBC its data suggests 58% of pregnant women have declined a Covid vaccine.\nIt acknowledged \"mixed messages\" about the safety of the vaccine at the start of the programme had caused confusion - but said it was disappointed there had not been more direct campaigns targeted at pregnant women by the government and NHS England, since vaccination was approved for the group in April.\nThe RCOG says pregnant women were the only clinically vulnerable group not prioritised for vaccination. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) now advises that pregnant women should all be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines where available, at the same time as the rest of the population.\nResearch from the US, involving more than 90,000 pregnant people found no risk, and experts say there is no reason to think there is any increased risk of miscarriage - as the vaccine does not appear to cross from the mother to child via the placenta.\nBoth colleges are urging those who are pregnant or considering pregnancy who have not yet been vaccinated to consider getting a jab as soon as possible and book their second doses as soon as they are eligible.\nUnvaccinated or partially vaccinated pregnant women should take steps to avoid infection by continuing to practice social distancing, particularly in their third trimester, they say.\nDr Edward Morris, RCOG president, said: \"We are concerned that increasing rates of Covid infection will adversely impact pregnant women.\n\"We know that those who are pregnant with Covid are at an increased risk of becoming severely ill, and the vaccine is the safest and most effective way of protecting women and their babies.\" \nGill Walton, RCM chief executive, said: \"Along with mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing, vaccination is a vital tool in the fight to protect yourself against this virus.\n\"If you are unsure or worried about this, do speak to your midwife or doctor to get the facts so that you can make an informed decision. \n\"All the evidence is showing that having the Covid jab is safe during pregnancy, and I do urge you to have the vaccine to protect yourself, your baby and your family.\""

      "text": "Britney Spears has told a US court she wants to charge her father Jamie for his alleged \"conservatorship abuse\".\n\"I'm here to press charges. I'm angry and I will go there,\" the singer said over a lawyer's phone on Wednesday.\nHer emotional statement came as a Los Angeles judge ruled Spears can choose her own lawyer in her fight to end the controversial legal arrangement.\nA conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions.\nConservatorship abuse can involve financially exploiting or imposing excessive personal restrictions on someone in your care.\nIf a court rules that abuse has taken place, the appointed conservator could be removed/suspended and may face financial penalties such as reimbursement payments and legal costs.\nFollowing the ruling, the singer posted an Instagram video of herself doing cartwheels in celebration with a caption thanking her fans and adding \"#FreeBritney\".\nIt is the first time she has used the hashtag, which has been used by her supporters to campaign against the conservatorship she has been subject to since 2008.\nThis week's hearing saw Spears address a court for the second time in less than a month.\nIn court last month, she made a dramatic plea to demanded that her father be removed from the legal agreement that has controlled her affairs for years.\n\"You're allowing my dad to ruin my life,\" she reiterated on Wednesday. \"I have to get rid of my dad and charge him with conservatorship abuse.\"\nThe conservatorship was put in place in 2008, when concerns over Spears' mental health prompted her father to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life.\nSpears' supporters rallied outside the court, and also gathered on the other side of the country in central Washington DC as the hearing was being held.\nLast month a judge denied the pop star's request to remove her father from his role overseeing her conservatorship. Judge Brenda Penny said she could not make a ruling until the singer files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement.\nWednesday's court ruling paves the way for Spears' lawyer of choice, former federal prosecutor Mathew Rosengart, to take charge of the complex legal battle.\nHe will replace Samuel Ingham, the court-appointed lawyer who had been representing Spears since 2008 before stepping down last week.\nDuring the hearing, Mr Ingham interrupted the court to say Spears was texting him. The singer wanted to address the court again, he said.\nThe judge officially accepted Mr Ingham's resignation before inviting Spears to speak.\nMr Rosengart, the high-powered Hollywood lawyer who has previously represented Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn, was also in court.\nA tearful Spears told the court that under the conservatorship, her hair vitamins and coffee had been confiscated.\n\"Ma'am, that's not abuse, that's just [expletive] cruelty,\" she told Judge Penny. \"Excuse my language, but it's the truth.\"\nThe singer said her top priority was removing her father from his role in the legal arrangement that governs her personal and financial affairs.\nShe said she did not wish to submit to a \"stupid\" medical assessment and would be \"happy\" for co-conservator Jodi Montgomery to remain.\nSpears continued: \"I just want you to understand how much of my time they have taken by forcing me to do these psyche tests and nothing comes of it.\"\nShe said she has \"extreme abandonment issues\" because of her father.\nThe singer also told the court she was \"extremely scared of my dad\", who is a recovering alcoholic, and feared he was always going to \"show up drunk somewhere and embarrass me\".\nJamie Spears is currently the sole person in charge of his daughter' $60m (\u00a343m) estate.\nBut his lawyers have previously denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter's private life.\nThe singer, a mother of two, said at last month's hearing that she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to do so. \nShe claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed, to make sure that she didn't get pregnant.\nWhile her father has overseen her estate for 13 years, his legal team say he has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health.\nHe was replaced on a temporary basis by Ms Montgomery, the co-conservator and care-giver of the singer.\nHis lawyers have requested an inquiry to establish the accuracy of his daughter's testimony.\nThe lawyers said the father was \"concerned \" about his daughter's well-being.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Mayors and political leaders across England have called for face masks to remain on public transport, despite coronavirus rules easing next week.\nAlmost all Covid-19 restrictions are set to be removed on 19 July.\nMayors including Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham and West Midlands' Andy Street have urged passengers to continue wearing face coverings.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan has declared masks mandatory on public transport in the capital.  \nBut Mr Khan, unlike his counterparts across England, has the power to make it compulsory.\nMr Burnham said masks would still be required on Greater Manchester's Metrolink tram network as part of a condition of carriage.  \nHe said he did not have power over buses or trains but urged people to continue wearing masks as an \"act of solidarity\". \nHe said he had been inundated with messages from vulnerable people describing 19 July as \"fear day\" rather than \"freedom day\", and it was \"not right\" that they should be \"forced off\" public transport. \nWest Yorkshire's mayor Tracy Brabin and Dan Jarvis in South Yorkshire have ordered the use of face coverings to continue in the county's bus stations and encouraged their use on public transport.  \nLiverpool mayor Steve Rotherham said he was asking all transport operators to enforce mask-wearing.\n\"I'll be asking all of them to do the right thing,\" he said. \nWearing face masks \"costs nothing\" and they were a \"minor inconvenience\", he added.\nMeanwhile, in the North East, council leaders have called for similar powers to those of the London mayor.\nNorth of Tyne's mayor Jamie Driscoll said coronavirus was \"still a dangerous disease\" and the government should \"reverse its decision\".\nHe added: \"You wouldn't make the speed limit voluntary.\"\nMr Street said he does not have the power to make face coverings mandatory across all modes of public transport, but called on passengers to \"join in this collective effort\", adding Transport for West Midlands staff would be handing out face masks after 19 July.\nThe government has previously said masks were still \"expected and recommended\" in crowded indoor areas, but people will not be required by law to wear them from Monday.\nMs Brabin repeated a call for the government to mandate the use of face masks across all public transport networks, saying 71% of people supported their continued use.\nWest of England Mayor Dan Norris said he had written to the prime minister to complain about the \"ridiculous\" decision not to enforce mask-wearing.\nThe North East in particular has seen a rapid rise in infection rates in recent weeks and Martin Gannon, leader of Gateshead Council, has written to the government saying masks could help tackle this. \nMiddlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said: \"I hate face masks, but I do know that wearing one limits the spread of Covid and saves lives.\n\"Freedom is in sight, but we just need one last push before the worst is finally behind us.\"  \nThe Greater Anglia train company, which operates services across the south and east of England, said it would continue to ask passengers to wear face coverings during busy times.\nIn Scotland, the mandatory use of face coverings will remain in place for \"some time\", First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said, even after the country eases most of its other restrictions on 19 July.\nIn Wales, masks will continue to be required by law in some settings, including public transport.   \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Welsh Parliament,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August.\nThe Welsh government said all laws on the number of people who can meet will end but First Minister Mark Drakeford warned against \"a free for all.\"\nNightclubs would be able to reopen, but face masks will still be required in most indoor public places except in pubs, restaurants and schools.\nSome rules will change on Saturday, meaning six people can to meet in private homes and holiday homes.\nDespite the plan to ease many rules, people will be asked to continue working from home wherever possible.\nMeanwhile, specific social distancing in workplace laws are expected to end from 7 August, with businesses left to decide if they still need to keep customers and workers apart through risk assessments.\nMr Drakeford warned the Senedd that the Delta variant is in every part of Wales and was \"spreading quickly\", with \"real dangers\" that could not be ignored.\nHe told a press conference: \"This is not a free-for-all.\"\n\"There will continue to be some important protections to help keep us all safe, especially those who are clinically vulnerable and who are perhaps the most anxious about an easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Welsh plan to move to its current lowest level of Covid restrictions - known as alert level 0 - on Saturday, 7 August, depends on the country's public health situation. \nIt means there will be more rules in Wales than in England.\nMr Drakeford said while he was \"reasonably confident\" vaccinations had weakened the link between infections and serious illness, with the number of Covid patients in hospital relatively low, there was still \"a risk that this third wave of the pandemic could cause real harm\".\nAlthough the case rate is rising Wales, the country has the lowest infection rate of the UK nations and has one of the world's highest vaccination rates.\nWales will move into the alert level one set of restrictions on Saturday - allowing for six people to meet in private homes and holiday accommodation.\nIce rinks will be able to reopen, and the limits on numbers that can meet in public places or at events outdoors will be removed.\nOutdoor indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing from the same day.\nFully vaccinated people will also no longer need to self-isolate if they are returning from an amber list country from Monday, following decisions taken in England and Scotland.\nBut people returning from an amber list country will need to have a PCR test on day two of their arrival - and cannot visit a hospital or care home within 10 days of returning from abroad.\nMr Drakeford criticised the UK government for having originally introduced the move, only putting it in place in Wales because it would have been \"untenable\" not to.\n\"The risk of re-importation of coronavirus from other parts of the world, and especially further new variants, has not gone away,\" he said.\n\"The removal of a defence against that risk, and especially at a time when the virus is in such rapid circulation, is hard to understand.\"\nUnder plans for alert level zero, ministers have proposed:\nThe face mask rules will remain in place despite the UK government's decision to scrap them in England.\nMinisters are also planning, during August, to allow people who are fully vaccinated not to self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive.\nWhile the specific laws requiring social distancing in workplaces and hospitality are expected to go, the issue will be left for organisations to work out.\nSpecific social distancing laws are expected to be scrapped outdoors this Saturday, and indoors on 7 August.\nThe Welsh government's coronavirus control plan states it will be for organisations to assess the risks, \"depending on the nature of the premises and the risks of exposure\".\nWelsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"Whilst we regret the Welsh Labour government has been the last government in Britain to publish a plan, it is a case of better late than never, and the lifting of restrictions will ensure we can get our economy and public services on the road to recovery.\"\nRhun ap Iorwerth, deputy leader of Plaid Cymru in the Senedd, added: \"The important thing is that Welsh government doesn't follow the ill-judged timetable being set by UK Government in lifting all restrictions during a period of increasing cases.\"\nAccording to the control plan, moving to 7 August will be \"subject to no new variants of concern being identified in Wales, hospital admissions and deaths from Covid-19 remaining at relatively low and manageable levels and if the vaccination programme continues as expected\".\nHospital admissions have risen in the past month but remain significantly lower than earlier in the pandemic.\nCovid rates in Wales stood at 145.3 per 100,000 people on Wednesday, compared to 138.2 the day before.\nThere are 69 patients with confirmed cases of Covid in hospital, compared to 39 a week before. That number is at its highest since mid-April.\n\"The balance of harm is changing,\" says the Welsh government's new Coronavirus control plan, meaning the harms of restrictions are beginning to outweigh the harms of Covid.\nNevertheless, the tone remains laden with caution and an emphasis on collective, as well as personal responsibility.\nWhile Mark Drakeford has rejected the idea of a \"spurious freedom day\", he has also acknowledged that all the home nations are heading broadly in the same direction.\nBut the first minister continues to stress the differences - keeping the requirement for face masks in most indoor settings and obligations on employers to undertake Covid risk assessments.\nThroughout the pandemic, ministers in Cardiff Bay have been convinced that voters want to see a cautious approach and even as we head into what everyone hopes might be the end game, that continues to be the note they want to strike.\n\"It feels like a long time coming,\" said Georgina Heffernan, from Cardiff restaurant The Potted Pig which had to halve its capacity to comply with social distancing.\nHowever, she said some customers may feel \"vulnerable\" if all social distancing measures were eased at once.\n\"We're lucky as a business that we can still implement certain social distancing standards,\" she said.\n\"I think for us that will stay. \n\"Obviously, we do want more customers but we also want the customers we do have to feel as safe as possible.\n\"We do not want to alienate customers who do still feel vulnerable and that don't want to come out into a really busy setting,\" she said.\n\"It has been a struggle. It has been hard on us as a business,\" she said\n\"A lot of people don't see what goes on behind the scenes.\n\"We have gone above and beyond to try and deal with the pandemic and live the pandemic.\"\nIndustry body UK Hospitality Cymru said lifting restrictions in August was \"brilliant\", but warned a more cautious approach in Wales at the height of the holiday season could lead to \"difficulties for customers and staff alike\".\nSara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium warned that caution on returning to offices would likely \"further push back the recovery for city centres and high streets where footfall remains over a quarter lower than pre-pandemic levels\".\n\"Ministers needs to be prepared to consider how best to support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to take longer than anticipated,\" she said.\nCBI Wales called for the Welsh Government \"to provide clear and consistent guidance on safety proposals as soon as possible to give firms time to plan ahead\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said that from 7 August, \"almost all businesses in Wales will be able to trade at capacity due to the easing of social distancing requirements\"."

He didn't have the guts to call it out, he hedged his bets and in doing so he undermined the team on the verge of this competition.\n\"He didn't have the courage to stand by the England team on the verge of this competition, and he's wrong about that and that's a failure of leadership.\"\nFormer Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has praised England players for taking the knee - adding they were \"bringing the whole country together\".\nIn an interview recorded on Thursday, Mr Brown told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that the team had taken a \"difficult decision\" in adopting the gesture - which England player Marcus Rashford has called the \"right thing to do\".\nHe added: \"I don't think it was right for Downing Street not to support Marcus Rashford.\n\"Marcus Rashford has stood up for some really good causes over the last year, but he's also stood up for far better race relations and community relations in this country. So we should support the team when it does this.\nMr Brown, who was Labour prime minister from 2007 to 2010, told Nick Robinson he would \"like Boris Johnson to come out publicly to support the England football team in what they do\".\nHe warned it would be \"bad for Britain\" if \"culture wars started to develop\" and \"people seized on one instance of someone doing something and trying to make it a big issue that divided the public rather than united the public\".\nOn Friday, Scotland Manager Steve Clarke said the players had decided to take the knee for their game against England next Friday to show \"solidarity\" with England players \"on the receiving end of abuse from fans\".\nThe Scotland players will continue to stand for their other games during the tournament. \nMr Clark added that the team had \"reflected\" on the matter as a group, after \"divisive and inaccurate comments\" about their decision to stand instead of kneel.\n\"We remain committed to our principles of taking a stand, but we must also be unequivocal in condemning the opportunistic false narrative being presented by some,\" he added. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed the team's stance, saying that taking the knee alongside England players was a \"good decision\".\nAsked about the booing on Sunday, Mr Rashford said: \"It's something that we can't control, and for us we believe [taking the knee is] the right thing to do, so we're going to continue to do it.\"\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has said his team's gesture, adopted throughout the last Premier League season, is not \"political\" but an attempt to highlight racial injustice.\nWales will also take the knee at Euro 2020.\nOn BBC One's Question Time on Thursday, Ms Keegan said people were \"perfectly free\" to take the knee, but added it was \"symbolism more than action\".\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he \"absolutely\" backed the \"symbolism of reminding the world of how painful it is to be subjected to the racism that Marcus Rashford has been subjected to\".\nHe added: \"If you then extrapolate to a Black Lives Matter movement that has a political agenda... that's a different place... which is why I think we just have to differentiate and rightly back our team.\"\nAmerican footballer Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the pre-game national anthem in the NFL in 2016, in protest at police violence against African-Americans.\nSince last year, when the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in the US, many sportspeople around the world have chosen to take the knee.\nNick Robinson's interview with Gordon Brown will be broadcast at 17:30 BST on Saturday on BBC Radio 4. It will also be available on BBC Sounds."

      "text": "A surge in flu and other respiratory viruses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter, warns a report by leading medics.\nThey say testing for flu, Covid and a respiratory virus common in children and the elderly - called RSV - may help doctors treat cases more quickly.\nThe Academy of Medical Sciences report calls for people with any symptoms to isolate and stay at home.\nThis will help protect against all respiratory viruses this winter.\nThe report, by 29 leading experts and requested by the government, says there is great uncertainty about what the next few months will hold across the UK, but it urges policymakers to prepare for a challenging winter.\nDuring lockdown last winter, the UK population was hardly exposed to the viruses which normally circulate. But they are now set to make a comeback as restrictions lift and society opens up.\nAlready this summer, there has been a rise in winter viruses in children coming to A&E.\nReport author Prof Azra Ghani, from Imperial College London, says their modelling suggests a summer peak of Covid-19 infections \"with subsequent local outbreaks over winter\".\nBut \"we can't completely rule out another winter wave\", she said.\n\"Whilst we expect the peak in deaths to be considerably lower than last winter, under some scenarios we could see hospital admissions rise to similar levels.\"\nIn a worst-case scenario this could mean around twice the levels of flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a normal autumn and winter, the report says.\nThere are between 10,000 and 30,000 deaths from flu in a normal winter, and about 20,000 children under five are admitted to hospital each year with RSV, which can cause a lung infection called bronchiolitis.\nThe authors say these viruses often produce similar symptoms, so testing for all three at once would help distinguish between them.\nThis could be done through Test and Trace or in GP practices, but the turnaround would need to be very fast so that anti-virals could be used to treat flu in the most vulnerable.\nDr Alexander Edwards, from the University of Reading, said the \"triple tests\" had \"great appeal\", but the logistics could be a challenge.\n\"Whether there will be enough instruments and testing capacity available for this to be available widely in primary care remains to be seen,\" he said.\nThe report also recommends booster Covid vaccines alongside flu vaccines this autumn to reduce the spread of the virus, which is already being planned by the NHS for the over-50s, and improving infection control in hospitals.\nIt says all adults need to be vaccinated against Covid by September. Currently, two-thirds of UK adults have received two doses and 87% have had one dose.\nBut the number one way to reduce transmission is for people to have a test when they have symptoms and stay at home if they are ill, says Prof Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\"We are calling on the government to urgently strengthen the financial and practical support that will allow all people to self-isolate if they need to, whatever their circumstances,\" she said.\nThe medics also emphasise the importance of face coverings, social distancing and meeting friends outdoors - to protect against Covid as well as other respiratory viruses, as society opens up."

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Waterstones says it will encourage its customers to continue wearing face coverings in its stores after they cease to be compulsory after 19 July.\nIt is one of the first major chains to state a firm policy on mask wearing.\nBusinesses are weighing up what approach to take once Covid measures become a matter for them to decide.\nSome shop workers and staff are worried that abandoning masks will put their health at risk, but others have reacted with anger at Waterstones' move.\nWaterstones said in a tweet: \"Following the lift of restrictions on 19 July across England, we will observe new government guidance. \n\"Given our enclosed browsing environment, we encourage our customers to wear face masks and observe social distancing, respecting the safety of staff and fellow book lovers.\" \nManaging director James Daunt told the BBC this would be communicated by signs, but staff would not enforce this: \"If you are wearing a mask and you don't want to be in the company with someone who isn't wearing a mask, we expect people will use their common sense and move away.\"\nHe said current safety precautions would remain in place, with screens up between booksellers and customers and staff wearing masks.\nThe tweet has attracted a mass - and mixed - response. Many are in favour of its position. The tweet had garnered 22,000 \"likes\" by lunchtime. \nCritical care nurse Kimberley Anne said: \"@Waterstones ! As an ITU nurse, I am so exhausted with all these waves of Covid and I personally feel more at ease bookshopping with a mask. I am freaking out already using the tube.\"\nBut Talk Radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer said: \"I make a point of buying books at my local @Waterstones rather than ordering on Amazon because I want bookstores to thrive, but if I go into your store and a member of staff asks me to wear a mask, you will lose my business forever.\"\nFrom Monday 19 July, the government has said, wearing face coverings in England will be recommended but not mandatory. \nTransport companies have been the most forthright in setting out their policies. London Transport said on Tuesday it would require passengers on the Tube, bus and its Overground railways to wear masks.  \nAirlines including BA and Ryanair have already confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July.\nBut most retailers have taken a more cautious approach, while many, including leading supermarkets, have not yet said anything concrete.\nTimpsons shoe repair and key cutting chain, which has more than 2,000 shops, is leaving mask wearing as a matter of personal choice for customers.\nSir John Timpson, its boss, said: \"I don't think the way it's going we've got any right, we shouldn't expect them to do so, that's entirely up to the customer.\" \nBut he said his staff would be asked to wear masks. \nJewellery retailer Beaverbrooks is going further. It told the BBC it would keep all of its current safety measures in place, including welcome barriers, hand sanitisation stations and serving screens. \nIt said staff would still be wearing visors or masks. But it added that although it could not force customers to wear masks, it would prefer them to continue to wear masks in its stores.\nAside from Sainsbury's, which said last week that mask wearing would be a matter of personal choice for customers, leading supermarkets have not so far publicly stated their approach. Morrisons says it is waiting for further guidance from the government. \nSome shoppers are uncomfortable with anything other than a clear safety policy. Commenting on Waterstones' move, Denys Whitley tweeted: \"'Encourage' is not strong enough. Mask-wearing must be mandatory. Non-masked are not respecting the safety of staff or fellow book-lovers... With this policy, I'll be sticking to the pathetic selection on Amazon.\"\nShop workers' union Usdaw had previously urged the government not to lift Covid safety measures in shops. \nAccording to a recent survey, it found violence, verbal abuse or threats of violence towards shop workers had increased 25-50%, with face coverings the trigger for 15% of the incidents. \nPaddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary, said: \"Shop workers already face violence and abuse when enforcing these measures and we are concerned that, when restrictions no longer have the force of the law behind them, this could result in further abuse, threats and violence towards retail workers.\"\nShould shops ask their customers to keep wearing masks after 19 July, when they are no longer compulsory?

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "text": "Nicolas Cage will no longer play Tiger King's Joe Exotic in an Amazon TV drama, explaining that executives think the story is \"no longer relevant\".\nThe Oscar-winning actor was cast as the zoo owner for a mini-series on the streaming service.\nHe told Variety he had read \"two excellent scripts\" for the show.\n\"But I think Amazon ultimately felt that it was material that had become past tense because it took so long for it come together,\" he said.\n\"They felt at one point that it was lightning in a bottle, but that point has since faded into the distance and it's no longer relevant.\" \nThe series may be offered to other broadcasters and platforms, according to reports in Hollywood, although it's unclear whether Cage would stay on board.\nAnother TV drama about him is still going ahead, however, featuring Hedwig and the Angry Inch's John Cameron Mitchell as Exotic opposite Saturday Night Live and Ghostbusters star Kate McKinnon as his nemesis Carole Baskin.\nThat series is being made by US network NBC's streaming service Peacock.\nA documentary about the infamous, polygamous, gun-wielding Exotic, who is currently serving 22 years in prison for attempting to hire two hitmen to murder Baskin, became a phenomenon on Netflix last year.\nThere has been heavy speculation that Netflix will make a second season, but that has still not been confirmed.\nCage, meanwhile, will soon be seen grappling with a very different kind of animal in a film called Pig, which Variety called a \"strange, sad porcine drama\" in which the actor gives \"his best performance in years\".\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
