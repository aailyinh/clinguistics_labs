      "title": "Covid-19: How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave",
      "tags": "Asia,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "In early March, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan declared the country was \"in the endgame\" of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMr Vardhan also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as an \"example to the world in international co-operation\". From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted \"vaccine diplomacy\".\nMr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100.  \nThe euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was \"bending the Covid infection curve\". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was \"breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight\". Mr Modi was called a \"vaccine guru\".\nAt the end of February, India's election authorities announced key elections in five states where 186 million people were eligible to vote for 824 seats. Beginning 27 March, the polls would stretch over a month, and in the case of the state of West Bengal, be held in eight phases. Campaigning had begun in full swing, with no safety protocols and social distancing. In mid-March, the cricket board allowed more than 130,000 fans, mostly unmasked, to watch two international cricket games between India and England at the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat.\nIn less than a month, things began to unravel. India was in the grips of a devastating second wave of the virus and cities were facing fresh lockdowns. By mid-April, the country was averaging more than 100,000 cases a day. On Sunday, India recorded more than 270,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths, both new single-day records. If the runway infection was not checked, India could be recording more than 2,300 deaths every day by first week of June, according to a report by The Lancet Covid-19 Commission. \nIndia is in now in the grips of a public health emergency. Social media feeds are full with videos of Covid funerals at crowded cemeteries, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals, long queues of ambulances carrying gasping patients, mortuaries overflowing with the dead, and patients, sometimes two to a bed, in corridors and lobbies of hospitals. There are frantic calls for help for beds, medicines, oxygen, essential drugs and tests. Drugs are being sold on the black market, and test results are taking days. \"They didn't tell me for three hours that my child is dead,\" a dazed mother says in one video, sitting outside an ICU. Wails of another person outside the intensive care punctuate the silences.  \nEven India's mammoth vaccination effort was now struggling. In the beginning, the rollout had been embroiled in a controversy over the efficacy over a home-grown candidate. Even as the country ramped up the drive and administered more than 100 million doses by last week, vaccine shortages were being reported. Serum Institute of India, the country's - and the world's - biggest vaccine maker said it would not be able to ramp up supplies before June because it didn't have enough money to expand capacity. India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, because the doses were needed urgently at home, and allowed imports of foreign vaccines. Even oxygen was likely to be imported now to meet the surge in demand. \nMeanwhile, almost in a parallel universe, away from the death and despair, the world's richest cricket tournament was being played behind closed doors every evening, and tens of thousands of people were following their leaders to election rallies and attending the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela. \"It is beyond surreal, what is happening,\" Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor, told me. \nExperts believe the government appears to have completely dropped the ball on the second wave of infections that was about to hit India. \nIn mid-February, Tabassum Barnagarwala, a journalist with the Indian Express newspaper, flagged a seven-fold rise in new cases in parts of Maharashtra and reported that samples from the infected had been sent for genome sequencing to look for imported variants.\nBy the end of the month, the BBC reported the surge and asked whether India was facing a new Covid wave. \"We really don't know what the cause of the surge is. What is worrying is that entire families are getting infected. This is a completely new trend,\" Dr Shyamsunder Nikam, civil surgeon of an affected district in Maharashtra, said at the time. \nExperts now say that crowing about India's exceptionalism in \"beating\" the epidemic - younger population, native immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly premature. \"As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis,\" said Mihir Sharma, a columnist for Bloomberg.\nIndia's second wave was fuelled by people letting their guard down, attending weddings and social gatherings, and by mixed messaging from the government, allowing political rallies and religious gatherings. With infections declining, fewer people were taking the jabs, slowing down the vaccination drive, which had aimed to inoculate 250 million people by the end of July. In mid-February, Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan, tweeted that India needed to \"accelerate the vaccination drive while the case counts are low\". Nobody quite took notice.\n\"There was a feeling of triumphalism,\" said K Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. \"Some felt we had achieved herd immunity. Everyone wanted to get back to work. This narrative fell on many receptive ears, and the few voices of caution were not heeded to,\" he said.\nA second wave may have been inevitable, but India could have \"postponed or delayed it and lessened its impact,\" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology. Like many other countries, India should have begun careful genomic surveillance in January to detect variants, Mr Menon said. Some of these variants could be driving the surge. \"We learnt of new variants in February from reports from Maharashtra. This was initially denied by authorities,\" Mr Menon added. \"This was a significant turning point.\"\nWhat are the lessons of this public health crisis? For one, India should learn not to declare victory over the virus prematurely, and it should put a lid on triumphalism. People should also learn to adapt to short, local lockdowns in the event of the inevitable future spikes of infection. Most epidemiologists predict more waves, given that India is evidently still far away from reaching herd immunity and its vaccination rate remains slow. \n\"We cant freeze human life,\" Professor Reddy said. \"If we can't physically distance in the crowded cities, we can at least make sure everyone wears a proper mask. And wear it properly. That's not a big ask.\""

      "tags": "Stratford-upon-Avon,Cambridge,London Bridge attack",
      "text": "A man working at Fishmongers' Hall stabbed an attacker with a large decorative spear after deciding \"he had to be hurt\", an inquest has heard.\nLukasz Koczocik described how he grabbed the ornament from a wall and went \"face to face\" with Usman Khan.\nKhan killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones and attacked others at a prisoner education event on 29 November 2019.\nAnother witness recalled how the 28-year-old had remained \"expressionless\" as he stabbed her.\nThe inquest jury at London's Guildhall was told how head porter Mr Koczocik sprang into action after a housekeeper ran downstairs, shouting \"someone's got stabbed\".\nThe Polish national said he went upstairs and saw a man with two knives who was being confronted by three men \"holding objects\", including a chair and a sign.\nHe said Khan was \"defending himself from the objects that were hitting him\" and did not stop even when \"they hit this man on the head with the chair\".\nMr Koczocik said he then \"froze for a few seconds\" before he pulled the ornamental spear, known as a boarding pike, from the wall.\n\"The next thing I remember - me going back to the lobby area and being with this man face to face.\n\"I decided he had to be hurt, because I realised what was happening. I tried to stab him,\" he said.\nThe head porter described how he tried to stab Khan in the face but \"he was batting me away\", and when he jabbed at his stomach he said he heard a \"metal clink\".\nKhan then grabbed the pike with one hand and dragged himself \"closer to me\", Mr Koczocik said, cutting at his hand and shoulder.\n\"I dropped the pike because he cut the tendon in my hands,\" he said, adding that he was probably only still alive because other people carrying makeshift weapons crowded Khan.\nButler Jeffrey Stevelman, who witnessed the confrontation between Mr Koczocik and Khan, described the scene as \"absolute chaos\".\nHe told the inquest there had been a \"Mexican standoff\" and Khan had stood there and opened his jacket and started shouting: 'I've got a bomb, call the police, I've got a bomb.'\n\"You stand there and try to process it. It was just unreal,\" he said.\nStephanie Szczotko, who also gave evidence, told the jury how Khan had stabbed her during the attack.\nThe former student had been at the event in central London due to her work with prisoners as part of her criminology degree at Cambridge.\nShe said she first heard screams and shouts, and \"a cluster of people\" had fled past her before \"I saw a man run towards me\".\nMs Szczotko, who suffered wounds to her arms and torso, said Khan had a knife raised above his head and she raised her arm \"instinctively\" as he struck.\n\"For a moment I felt I was just paused in that moment,\" she said. \"I remember looking at him with shock and confusion.\"\nWhen asked about her witness statement, in which she described how her attacker \"didn't seem particularly bothered or psyched up\", she replied that he had been \"expressionless\".\nThe Guildhall also heard from Samy Sadek, an emergency doctor who described how he was met by several \"very distressed\" armed police officers after being called to the attack.\nDescribing what he saw upon entering the hall, the consultant said there were \"numerous police officers, there was a lot of noise by way of shouting - there was lots and lots of blood\".\nDr Sadek said he saw Ms Jones, 23, being given CPR at the foot of a staircase, but felt the extent of her injuries meant \"there was no intervention we were able to provide to save her life\". \nHe described how as he examined other casualties, including 25-year-old Mr Merritt, he was told there was a bomb.\nThe consultant explained that he and his team \"were attempting to establish whether there was an ongoing threat\" but \"no-one was able to tell us if there was one or more assailant\".\nDr Sadek told the Guildhall he and his colleagues began massaging Mr Merritt's heart but \"we were not able to resuscitate Jack\".\nWhen asked whether every effort had been put in to help both victims, Dr Sadek replied: \"Absolutely everything was being done.\"\nSimon Bird, a maintenance electrician working at the hall that day, also gave evidence. He described how he heard Khan shouting for the front doors to be opened.\nHe said: \"I heard a voice from someone I now know to be Usman Khan: 'Open the effing door, open the effing door.'\nMr Bird, who said Khan had a large kitchen knife in his hand, said he then witnessed what he described as \"a river of blood\".\nThe inquest hearing continues."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson",
      "text": "The government will take \"whatever action necessary\", including legislative options, to stop plans for a European Super League, No 10 says.\nFollowing the PM's meeting with the FA and Premier League officials, and fans' representatives, Downing Street said: \"No action is off the table.\"\nThe 12 founding members of the league faced a fierce backlash after unveiling proposals for a breakaway tournament.\nOne of these, Real Madrid, insisted they were doing it to \"save football\".\nClub president Florentino Perez said the decision to create the new league was in part taken because \"young people are no longer interested\" in the game. \nHe told a Spanish TV show: \"Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt.\"\nThe president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, has warned players who play for teams in the ESL that they would be \"banned from the World Cup and the Euros\".\nBut in a letter to Uefa and Fifa, seen by the BBC, lawyers for the ESL say they have filed injunctions to prevent player and club bans, saying they consider such actions to be \"unlawful\".\nAn insider at the ESL said they had prepared themselves for a huge backlash, and thought they were on firm legal ground with respect to competition law. \n\"I think in the cold light of day, they are looking at this and the reality is dawning that this is happening and it's perfectly legal,\" they told the BBC.\nA Spanish court has temporarily blocked any attempt by Uefa or Fifa to ban clubs or players from leagues or competitions, in an interim ruling to prevent any bans before the legal basis of this can be tested. \nESL insiders said \"this looks aggressive but we had to take defensive action in the face of threats from Uefa and Fifa - our hope is we can ultimately resolve this in negotiations\".\nThe 14 Premier League clubs not participating in the new venture \"unanimously and vigorously\" rejected the plans for the competition and are \"considering all actions available to prevent it from progressing\".\nA statement released on Tuesday said they \"call on those clubs involved in the proposed competition to cease their involvement immediately\".\nOne of these, Everton, released a statement criticising the \"preposterous arrogance\" of the clubs involved.\nDowning Street said the prime minister told his meeting with FA and Premier League officials that the government \"will not stand by while a small handful of owners create a closed shop\".\nBoris Johnson reiterated his \"unwavering support for the football authorities and confirmed they have the government's full backing to take whatever action necessary to put a stop to these plans\", a statement said.\nHe also made it clear \"that no action is off the table and the government is exploring every possibility, including legislative options, to ensure these proposals are stopped\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said among the measures under consideration were preventing players of the clubs involved getting work visas and the withdrawal of police funding for match days.\nChief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, Kevin Miles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: \"The mood music from the government was they would do what was required to make sure that the measures to exclude those [ESL] clubs from competitions would not fall foul of competition law, and that they would amend the law if necessary.\"\nUK watchdog the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be \"carefully considering any competition aspects of these proposals\".\nThe proposed league has united MPs from every party against it. Suggestions from MPs on action the government could take include governance reform, changes to competition law, changes to taxpayer support for clubs and border controls on arrivals into the UK.\nThe Arsenal Supporters' Trust said it was \"delighted\" to hear the government's promise of action, adding that the PM vowed the football governance review led by Conservative MP and former sports minister Tracey Crouch would be \"swift\".\nThere have been protests by fans across the country against the proposed league, including outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground on Tuesday. \nSix English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league.\nThey would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan.\nThe competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition.\nMatches would take place midweek in an attempt to have more matches between the big-name clubs and rival the existing Champions League.\nThe plans revealed on Sunday that the 12 founding football clubs would be permanent members and never face relegation. \nCritics say the new league could supplant the existing Champions League and disrupt the current football \"pyramid\" that sees teams rise or fall on merit.\nRead more here.\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer told BBC Breakfast the six English clubs should be expelled from the Premier League, which they have said they aim to remain in while also playing in the European Super League.\n\"It's not right what they are doing, it's not competitive, it's a closed shop - you can't have a competition where no one else is allowed in,\" he said.\n\"You can hear, feel and see the anger from almost everyone in football.\"\nChairman of the Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Julian Knight, said restricting work visas for footballers who play in the proposed ESL could be one way the government could pull levers to stop the league going ahead.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said other options were a windfall tax on clubs and long-term reform giving fans much greater power on football club boards.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he thought the \"threat of legislation will have an effect\" but the government needed to act quickly. \nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called for \"real action\" from the government, suggesting a new law requiring owners to ballot season ticket holders before committing clubs to newly formed competitions. \nAnd on Monday, the Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the Football Association, said he shared fans' concerns about \"the damage it risks causing to the game we love\".\nGianni Infantino, president of the world football's governing body Fifa, said he \"strongly disapproves\" of the plans.\n\"If some elect to go their own way, they must live with the consequences of their choice. They are responsible for their choice completely. This means you are either in or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out.\"\nSky Sports confirmed it had \"not been involved in any discussions\" about the breakaway league."

      "title": "George Floyd: US city on edge as jury deliberates Chauvin verdict",
      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The jury in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis policeman accused of killing George Floyd last year, has retired to consider its verdict.\nThe prosecution told jurors that Mr Chauvin had murdered Mr Floyd, but the defence said their client had correctly followed police training.\nThe court is being protected by barbed wire, high barriers and armed soldiers from the National Guard.\nCities across the country are bracing for protests regardless of the verdict.\nOn Monday, the prosecution and defence made their closing statements in a trial that lasted three weeks. The prosecution then had another opportunity to rebut defence arguments before the jury was sent to deliberate.\nMr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson argued that his client did what any \"reasonable police officer\" would have done after finding himself in a \"dynamic\" and \"fluid\" situation involving a large man scuffling with three officers.\nHe said Mr Chauvin's body camera and badge were knocked off his chest owing to \"the intensity of the struggle\".\nMr Nelson also argued that Mr Floyd's drug use was \"significant\" because the body reacts to opioid use, specifically in the case of someone who had been diagnosed with hypertension and high blood pressure.\nThe lawyer also argued that his client was unlikely to have intentionally violated use-of-force rules as he would have been aware that the whole interaction was being recorded. \"Officers know that they are being videotaped,\" added Mr Nelson.\nProsecutor Steve Schleicher urged jurors to \"use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,\" referring to the video showing Mr Chauvin kneeling on Mr Floyd for more than nine minutes last 25 May.\n\"This wasn't policing; this was murder,\" he added.\nProsecutor Jerry Blackwell had the final word on Monday. He said the matter was \"so simple that a child can understand it\".\n\"In fact, a child did understand it, when the nine-year-old girl said, 'Get off of him,'\" Mr Blackwell said, referring to a young onlooker who objected. \"That's how simple it was. 'Get off of him.' Common sense.\"\nThe jury will be sequestered to consider testimony from 45 witnesses, including doctors, use-of-force experts, police officers, bystanders and people who were close to Mr Floyd.\nThe defendant is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Mr Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge - second-degree murder. \nA conviction on any of the counts against him will require the jury to return a unanimous verdict. A single juror holding out would result in a mistrial, but the state could then try Mr Chauvin again.\nOf the 12 jurors, six are white, four are black and two are multiracial. Seven are women and five are men. \nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, restraining Mr Floyd, a black man, on the floor as he shouted \"I can't breathe\" spurred months of global protests in 2020.\nOn Monday the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, requested security assistance from the states of Ohio and Nebraska ahead of the verdict. \nThe Democrat was heavily criticised after more than 1,000 buildings and businesses were damaged in rioting last year.\nIn the early hours of Sunday, two National Guard members who were providing neighbourhood security in Minneapolis escaped with minor injuries when they were shot at in a drive-by shooting.\nBy Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Minneapolis\nThe streets around the court were quiet on Monday morning, but local residents are waiting to see what will happen once the verdict is reached.\nOne activist tells me they are planning to hit the streets, regardless of what kind of verdict is rendered.\nIf the jurors decide that Derek Chauvin is not guilty on all counts, or guilty only of manslaughter - a lesser charge - the activists will march.\nBut even if he is found guilty on all counts, the activists will still march - \"a celebratory protest\", as one of them put it.\nIn that case, the campaigners will take to the streets to show their satisfaction with the verdict, and to demand justice for the others who have died while in police custody.\nAfter the jury was sent out on Monday, Mr Nelson argued remarks made by Democratic representative Maxine Waters over the weekend urging protesters to \"get more confrontational\" may have influenced the jury.\nIf there is no guilty verdict in Mr Chauvin's trial, the California congresswoman said in Minneapolis, \"then we know that we got to not only stay in the street, but we have got to fight for justice\".\nIn response, Judge Peter Cahill said: \"I give you that congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this trial being overturned.\"\nThe judge said the failure of elected officials to stop talking about the case in a manner disrespectful to the rule of law was \"abhorrent\".\nHowever, he said Ms Waters' \"opinion really doesn't matter a whole lot\", and he dismissed Mr Nelson's motion for a mistrial."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Edinburgh,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Scottish restaurant owner has described new draft hospitality Covid guidance as a \"bombshell\".\nThe sector had expected that 1m (3ft) social distancing would apply between tables when it reopens next Monday.\nBut the new proposals state people from different households will now have to observe social distancing at tables.\nThe government said it had worked with industry and unions to ensure its guidance was \"evidence-based, fair and ethical, clear and realistic\". \nWhen Scotland moves to level three next Monday\u00a0the hospitality sector will be able to sell alcohol outdoors to a maximum group of six people from six households.\nThe sale of alcohol indoors will not be permitted, however, a maximum of six people from two households will be able to meet indoors and premises will close at 20:00.\u00a0\u00a0 \nCarina Contini, co-owner of Cantini restaurants in Edinburgh, said she was feeling \"really optimistic\" until the new guidance was published at 18:00 on Friday.\nShe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"They have thrown us an absolute bombshell, an absolutely impossibility in terms of reopening.\n\"The bookings that we have already got we will have to phone up and say 'I'm sorry we can't honour your booking because we can't host this level of capacity'.\"\nMs Contini said she would also have to let down suppliers and her staff.\nShe added: \"It is absolutely going to be crippling for the sector.\"\nShe said the rules were completely impractical.\n\"If I was catering for six people at a table, I would have to have a table that is 3.5m (11ft) long,\" she said. \n\"There is not a restaurant supplier in the country that makes tables that are 3.5m long.\n\"Elderly couples who may be hard of hearing are going to have to FaceTime themselves over lunch because the distance is so far away.\"\nMs Contini also criticised the short notice, ahead of the sector's planned reopening next Monday, and urged the Scottish government to reconsider.\nShe added: \"These regulations are now more harmful, more dangerous to our business than Covid itself.\"\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, emphasised that the guidance was draft.\nShe told Good Morning Scotland: \"It is extremely important that the sector have the opportunity to comment, to express their concerns and to see what is feasible for them.\n\"I imagine the reason the 1m requirement between different household members is in place is to provide additional protection but the government has to balance up additional harms at the moment.\"\nMeanwhile, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of an \"impending unemployment tsunami\" and said a majority of businesses had run out of money to pay furlough contributions and fixed costs.\nIt also highlighted a recent survey of its members which found the average Covid-related debt was \u00a3150,000 or more per premises.\nNTIA spokesman Gavin Stevenson said: \"Many of our members have been closed for over a year now, and virtually all have suffered crippling financial losses. \n\"In short, the money going out every month has been far greater than the money coming in, and government support has typically covered less than a quarter of this deficit.\"\n\"To add insult to injury government support has now ended while there is no end date to forced closure and other restrictions.\"\nHe called on the Scottish government to provide \"substantial and immediate\" additional support for as long as businesses remain closed and operate under \"unviable\" restrictions.\nAlternatively, he said his members needed a \"clear route map\" with target dates for the end of all legal restrictions on capacity, activity and opening hours.\nThe Scottish government said the draft guidance \"may be amended subject to comments received to take into account engagement with stakeholders.\"\nA spokesman added: \"The requirement to physical distance has been established for some time and businesses are already following existing sectoral advice on this. The draft guidance builds on that but does not introduce significant change.\"\nHe added that it would help businesses due to open next week do so \"as safely as possible\" and provided guidance on how business owners could calculate maximum capacity on their premises.\nLast week hospitality and tourism leaders in Scotland criticised the Covid restrictions which prevent the sector from reopening.\nAnd they warned that waiting two weeks before reopening would come at a cost to Scotland's economy of \u00a320m.\nThey were speaking as England's lockdown rules eased further, with pub gardens and restaurants among the places able to reopen.\nSouth of the border people can now visit bars and restaurants outdoors but must either follow the rule of six, or be in a group of any size with no more than two households present. Tables must be socially distanced.\nThe First Minister is set to confirm what she's been signalling for some time - hospitality will re-open in Scotland next Monday, April 26.\nThere will be restrictions on the industry, and one measure that many owners find frustrating is one metre social distancing.\nThis is the same rule that was in place last year. It means there should be one metre between any customers who are not part of the same household, even if they are at the same table. \nIt's not hard to work out why this isn't popular with some industry figures - social distancing (even at one metre) means fewer customers can fit in.\nBut the virus is still circulating, and measures like this are designed to lower transmission risk.\nOther changes scheduled for April 26 should go ahead as planned. Gyms and shops will re-open, and travel between Scotland, England and Wales should be possible. But it's unlikely further changes will be accelerated."

      "text": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) is predicting a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic.\nTotal energy emissions for 2021 will still be slightly lower than in 2019, the agency says.\nBut CO2 will rise by the second largest annual amount on record. \nThe use of coal in Asia is expected to be key: the IEA says it will push global demand up by 4.5%, taking it close to the global peak seen in 2014. \nHowever, renewable energy is also booming, with green sources set to supply 30% of electricity this year.\nThe empty roads, high streets and airports that marked the global response to coronavirus saw the biggest fall in demand for energy since World War Two. \nThat decline saw carbon emissions tumble by around 6% in 2020, as the more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal and oil were hardest hit by restrictions. \nMany hoped that these changes in energy use would be sustained in the recovery from the pandemic, but these latest predictions from the IEA indicate that is not likely to be the case. \nEnergy demand is booming in the developing world, with a rise of 3.4% predicted for this year - this contrasts with richer economies, where overall energy use is expected to still be 3% below 2019. \nIn the places where energy demand is growing, coal is playing a key role. \nOverall global use declined by around 4% in 2020, but is expected to rise by 4.5% this year.\nThis is mainly happening in Asia, where China is leading the way and expected to account for more than half of the global coal growth this year.\nBut even in the US and EU, where coal has been on the back foot for some time, demand is expected to rise - although it will still likely remain below 2019 levels in these regions.\nAccording to the IEA, coal demand is likely to be close to the global peak seen in 2014 - and that has implications for efforts to rein in climate change. \n\"Global carbon emissions are set to jump by 1.5 billion tonnes this year - driven by the resurgence of coal use in the power sector,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director.\n\"This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate.\"\nThe emissions predictions for 2021 would be even worse, according to the IEA, if demand for oil increased to pre-covid levels. \nBy the end of this year, oil use for aviation is still expected to be 20% below 2019 levels.\nHowever there are some strong positives for renewable energy in the IEA report. Wind, solar and other sustainable forms grew 3% during 2020, and in the power sector they are expected to grow by 8% this year. \nOverall green energy sources will provide 30% of electricity generation, the highest level since the beginning of the industrial revolution.\nReflecting the complexities of the global energy picture, China is likely to account for almost half the global increase in renewable electricity this year. \n\"As we have seen at the country-level in the past 15 years, the countries that succeed to cut their emissions are those where renewable energy replaces fossil energy,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, who has studied the factors that drive countries to change their power systems. \n\"What seems to be happening now is that we have a massive deployment of renewable energy, which is good for tackling climate change, but this is occurring alongside massive investments in coal and gas.\"\n\"Stimulus spending post-Covid-19 worldwide is still largely funding activities that lock us into high CO2 emissions for decades.\"\nLater this week, President Biden will host a climate summit, with around 40 presidents and prime ministers expected to take part virtually. \nThe US is also expected to announce a significantly improved emissions cutting target for 2030.\nAccording to the IEA, these actions can't come quickly enough if emissions are to be reined in to keep the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement within sight. \n\"Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022,\" said Dr Birol from the IEA.\n\"The leaders' summit on climate hosted by US President Joe Biden this week is a critical moment to commit to clear and immediate action ahead of COP26 in Glasgow.\" \nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "Former US Vice-President Walter Mondale has died in Minneapolis on Monday aged 93, his family has announced.\nMr Mondale was Jimmy Carter's running mate for his winning 1976 presidential bid and defeat four years later.\nMr Carter said he considered Mr Mondale the \"best vice-president in our country's history\".\nMr Mondale lost heavily to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election, securing only his home state of Minnesota and Washington DC. \nThat gave him 13 electoral votes compared with President Reagan's record-high tally of 525. \nMr Mondale is also remembered for choosing Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate - the first woman on a major-party presidential ticket.\nIn a statement, Mr Carter said he was \"an invaluable partner and an able servant of the people of Minnesota, the United States and the world\".\n\"Rosalynn and I join all Americans in giving thanks for his exemplary life, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden said in a statement that they \"were able to call one of our nation's most dedicated patriots and public servants a dear friend and mentor\".\n\"Jill and I had the opportunity to speak to Fritz and his family over the weekend, to reflect on the years of friendship we shared, and how much we learned from and leaned on each other.\"\nMr Mondale's family earlier said in a statement: \"It is with profound sadness that we share news that our beloved dad passed away.\"\nThe family paid tribute to his achievements in housing, civil rights and environmental policy.\nThey said plans for memorials in both Minnesota and Washington DC would be announced later."

      "title": "George Floyd death: Five key moments from the Derek Chauvin trial",
      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The death of George Floyd, a 48-year-old black man, while he was being restrained by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, during an arrest in Minneapolis in May 2020, shocked the world and sparked global protests about racism and police brutality.\nChauvin's three-week trial - on charges of murder and manslaughter - has now resulted in his conviction. \nHere are five key moments from the trial which heard from 45 witnesses and saw hours of video footage filmed by bystanders.\nSome of the most powerful testimony came in the first days of the trial when witnesses spoke of what they saw that day.\nDarnella, who was 17 at the time of Mr Floyd's death, filmed the video that went viral around the world. She told the jury there were nights when she stayed up \"apologising to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life\".\n\"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles. Because they are all black,\" she said.\nEmotional testimony also came from Charles McMillian, 61, who had been among the first on the scene and had tried to persuade Mr Floyd to get in the police car.\nHe broke down in tears watching graphic footage of the arrest in court, saying he had felt \"helpless\" as events unfolded and explained that he had confronted Chauvin after Mr Floyd was taken away in an ambulance because \"what I watched was wrong\".\nThe defence has argued that the presence of bystanders influenced Chauvin's actions that day. The court heard from one Minneapolis police officer, Peter Chang, that the crowd had been \"very aggressive to the officers\", while Nicole McKenzie, who trains the city's police on providing medical care, said the presence of bystanders at an arrest could make it harder for officers to see signs of distress in those they detained.\nAnother powerful moment came when Mr Floyd's girlfriend of three years, Courteney Ross, took the stand.\nShe described their first meeting, in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where Mr Floyd worked as a security guard, and how he had been devastated by his mother's death in 2018.\nMs Ross also told the court they both suffered from chronic pain, which led to an off-and-on struggle with opioid addiction.\n\"We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,\" she testified.\nOne of the defence's arguments has been that Mr Floyd died largely because of complications from the opioids and methamphetamine he had in his system at the time of his arrest. \nAnother key issue at the heart of this trial has been whether Derek Chauvin violated policies on restraint when he kneeled on George Floyd's neck for nine and a half minutes.\nThe head of Minneapolis police, Chief Medaria Arradondo, was one of the prosecution's most high-profile witnesses and had fired Chauvin a day after the arrest.\nHe told the court that the police officer should have stopped applying \"that level of force\" the moment Mr Floyd stopped resisting. \"It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values\" to continue with such force, he said.\nDefence witness Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert, said Chauvin had been \"justified\" and acted \"with objective reasonableness\" because of the \"imminent threat\" Mr Floyd posed in resisting arrest.\nHowever, he did concede under cross-examination that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well-known among law enforcers.\nThe cause of Mr Floyd's death was arguably central to this trial, with the prosecution maintaining he died from asphyxia while the defence pointed to Mr Floyd's drug use and general poor health. \nDr Martin Tobin, an expert in pulmonary medicine, used video footage to explain what was happening to Mr Floyd's breathing during the nine and a half minutes he lay under Chauvin's knee.\nEven \"a healthy person, subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to, would have died,\" he said.\nA key witness for the defence, forensic pathologist David Fowler, said Mr Floyd's death should have been classified as \"undetermined\" rather than as a homicide, because there were \"so many conflicting different potential mechanisms\". \nComplicating factors included Mr Floyd's drug use and possible exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from the police car's exhaust, said Dr Fowler, who was chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland until his retirement in 2019.\nHowever, under cross-examination he agreed that Mr Floyd should have been given immediate medical attention when he went into cardiac arrest, as there still was a chance to save his life.\nJust before the defence rested its case, the man on trial - Derek Chauvin - confirmed to the judge that he would not testify.\n\"I will invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege today,\" he said, referring to the constitutional right to remain silent in fear of self-incrimination.\nAsked by the judge whether this was his decision alone, and whether anyone else had unfairly influenced his decision, Chauvin responded: \"No promises or threats, your honour.\"\nChauvin pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree unintentional murder - for which he could be jailed for up to 40 years - third-degree murder, and manslaughter. \nThe jury took under a day to return a unanimous verdict convicting him of all charges."

      "tags": "Minnesota,Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "A US jury has found a former police officer guilty of murder over the death of African-American George Floyd on a Minneapolis street last year. \nDerek Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May.\nThe widely watched footage sparked worldwide protests against racism and excessive use of force by police.\nChauvin was found guilty on three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.\nHis bail was immediately revoked and he was placed in custody. Sentencing is likely to happen in two months, and Chauvin could spend decades in jail. \nIn Minnesota, second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Second-degree manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. \nChauvin is expected to appeal against the verdict. \nPolice officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial has been widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future.\nThree other officers are due to face trial later this year on aiding-and-abetting charges. \nThe 12-member jury took less than a day to reach their verdict, which followed a highly-charged, three-week trial that left Minneapolis on edge.\nSeveral hundred people cheered outside the court as the verdict was announced.\nThe Floyd family's lawyer, Ben Crump, said it marked a \"turning point in history\" for the US.\n\"Painfully earned justice has finally arrived,\" he tweeted. \"[It] sends a clear message on the need for accountability of law enforcement.\"\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris called the Floyd family after the verdict.  Mr Biden was heard saying that \"at least now there is some justice\".  \nIn nationally televised remarks shortly afterwards, Mr Biden said: \"Systemic racism is a stain on the whole nation's soul.\"\nMeanwhile, Ms Harris urged lawmakers to pass the George Floyd bill aimed at reforming policing in the US. \nThe Minneapolis police federation, a not-for-profit organisation representing police, said they respected the jury's decision.\n\"We also want to reach out to the community and still express our deep remorse for their pain, as we feel it every day as well. There are no winners in this case,\" the federation said.\nAccording to reports, one of the most likely avenues of appeal is the huge publicity given to the case, with the defence team arguing that this might have influenced the jury.\nAlso, Presiding Judge Peter Cahill said on Monday that public comments by Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters could be grounds for an appeal.\nOver the weekend, Ms Waters had urged protesters to \"stay on the street\" and \"get more confrontational\" if Chauvin was acquitted.\nOn hearing the verdict, people were screaming and cheering, and a little girl in a pink coat held up a tiny fist, in jubilation.\n\"It's a good day in Minneapolis,\" says 21-year-old Kenneth Nwachi. \"It's a blessing.\"\nActivists say justice has been done, and they will feel as though a weight has been lifted from their shoulders. \nTheir relief is shared by many in the city, a place that has been on edge for months. It is a landmark case for police use of force against black people, and the verdict marks a significant break with the past.\nFew officers are charged with manslaughter or murder, and fewer still are convicted. \nBut protesters say the calls for justice for George Floyd do not stop after this verdict.\nThe 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in South Minneapolis on the evening of 25 May 2020.\nA shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit $20 note and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back.\nWhen police arrived, they ordered Mr Floyd out of his parked car and handcuffed him. A struggle ensued when officers tried to put a screaming Mr Floyd in their squad car. They wrestled him to the ground and pinned him under their weight.\nChauvin pressed his knee into the back of Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, as the suspect and several bystanders pleaded for his life.\nAs he was being restrained, Mr Floyd said more than 20 times that he could not breathe, pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\". \nWhen the ambulance arrived, Mr Floyd was motionless. He was pronounced dead about an hour later.\nDuring Chauvin's trial, the jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of video footage.\nSome of the most powerful testimony came from eyewitnesses. Several broke down in tears as they watched graphic footage of the incident and described feeling \"helpless\" as events unfolded.\nMr Floyd's girlfriend of three years and his younger sibling also took the stand. \nExpert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Mr Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to the manner of restraint employed by Chauvin and his colleagues.\nChauvin himself chose not to testify, invoking his right to not incriminate himself with his responses.\nManslaughter is when someone unintentionally causes another person's death.\nIn second-degree murder, the act that led to someone's death could have been intentional or unintentional. The maximum sentence for this charge is 40 years in prison.\nThird-degree murder means that an individual has acted in a way that endangered one or more people, ending in death.\nTwelve jurors were tasked with deciding if Chauvin would face time in jail or be acquitted.\nThe jury remained anonymous and unseen throughout the trial, but its demographics skewed younger, more white and more female.\nAfter both sides presented closing arguments on Monday, the jury was isolated in a hotel with no outside contact so they could deliberate on a verdict, a process known as sequestration.\nJurors had to agree on a unanimous verdict and were told they could not return home until they had made their decision."

      "text": "A review of policing says officers sometimes struggled to enforce coronavirus restrictions because of a lack of clarity from ministers. \nThe analysis by a policing watchdog found chief constables heard about new restrictions from the government's television briefings.\nConfusion led to mistakes, putting confidence at risk, say inspectors. \nThe report says that despite major challenges, forces in England and Wales learned from mistakes. \nIt adds that it is essential the police do not become seen as \"coercive agents of ministers\". \nHer Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), the body that reviews how well police do their work, said the rapid introduction and repeated changes to coronavirus laws left forces confused. \n\"Despite close working between the Home Office and national policing leaders, communication about restrictions and regulations was often at short notice and subject to change,\" says the inspectors' report. \n\"Many forces expressed frustration at the way that some government announcements were communicated... they had not been consulted in advance. \n\"This made it difficult to produce [internal] advice to forces on enforcing legislation.\"\nPolice chiefs in England told the inspectors they had little access to policymakers in the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), who were devising the new laws. \nSome were so concerned about what they were legally required to do, they took their own legal advice. \n\"Some forces expressed concern that they first heard of certain changes at the 5pm daily televised government briefings,\" says the report.\n\"In some cases, the changes required immediate implementation and many forces felt disadvantaged by a lack of notice and consultation.\n\"Their difficulty was made worse by a widespread confusion in relation to the status of government announcements and statements by ministers. \n\"Ministers asserting that their guidance - which had no higher status than requests - were in fact 'instructions to the British people' inevitably confused people.\"\nExamples include widespread confusion over whether repeat daily exercise had become a crime - it hadn't - and whether the two-metre social distancing \"rule\" was a legal requirement, when in fact it was only good practice.\n\"In these circumstances, mistakes were made... High-profile examples included road checks to identify unnecessary journeys, drone surveillance of people in open and almost deserted places, and police action in relation to non-essential shopping and what was thought to be excessive exercise.\"\n\"And as difficulties arose and some well-publicised mistakes were made, public confidence in, and support for, the police were inevitably put at risk.\"\nThe chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, said the report recognised the past 12 months had been \"one of the biggest challenges to face modern policing, and that the service has stepped up and met that challenge head on\".\nHe added: \"We haven't always got things right straightaway, and we have sought throughout the pandemic to learn as we go and improve the service we provide.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"The police have worked tirelessly to keep us safe during the pandemic and as this report shows, took immediate and decisive action to help protect the NHS and save lives.\n\"Whilst the majority of us have been able to stay at home, our courageous officers have been out on the streets pursuing criminals, protecting the public and enforcing the coronavirus rules where necessary.\"\nA Home Office spokesman praised the police for tirelessly working during the pandemic and said there had been a constant dialogue with chiefs that had informed the devising of restrictions.

      "tags": "Travel,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "India has been added to a \u201cred list\u201d of countries from which most travel to the UK is banned, over fears of a new Covid variant, the health secretary has said.\nFrom 04:00 BST on Friday 23 April, most people who have travelled from India in the last 10 days will be refused entry.\nBritish or Irish passport holders, or people with UK residence rights, will be allowed in but must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.\nMatt Hancock said there had been 103 UK cases of the India variant.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on Monday, the health secretary said the vast majority of the cases of the new variant - officially known as B.1.617 - had been linked to international travel.\nHe said test samples had been analysed to see if the new variant had any \"concerning characteristics\" such as greater transmissibility or resistance to treatments and vaccines.\nHe told MPs: \"After studying the data, and on a precautionary basis, we've made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the red list.\"\nHealth officials say this new variant, first identified in India, has some worrying genetic changes that need exploring.\nIt's still too soon to say if it is more contagious, deadly and will evade vaccines - and whether it should join the Variant of Concern list that the South Africa, Kent and Brazil variants belong to.\nAssessments are ongoing, and in the meantime the government is looking to stop more cases arriving and spreading in the country. \nThat's why the government is also stepping up surge testing to quickly find any new cases in the UK and is introducing a speedy new type of lab test that can show within hours if someone is positive for Covid - and if the infection they have is one of the known variants, including this new one from India. \nIt should mean people can isolate faster to prevent giving it to their friends, families, neighbours and colleagues.\nYou can read more from Michelle here.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted the move was made to ensure the UK did not lose its \"hard-won progress on the vaccine rollout\".\nA briefing document drawn up by officials at Public Health England shows that between 25 March and 7 April, 3,345 arrivals from India were registered in UK border travel data. Of those 161 - or 4.8% - tested positive for Covid-19 after a PCR test.\nThe new travel rule applies to England and Scotland. There are currently no direct international flights into Wales or Northern Ireland. \nScotland's Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"International travel will continue to remain a significant risk, requiring a cautious approach, on a four-nation basis.\" \nMr Hancock said there had also been 557 cases of the South Africa variant found in the UK since December, with a \"cluster\" of cases in south London and isolated cases in Barnet, Birmingham and Sandwell over the last week.\nWhile around two-thirds were related to international travel, there had been a \"small amount\" of community transmission, he added.\nHe said the government was \"ramping up\" plans for a booster shot to ensure vaccines stayed \"ahead of the virus\". \nIt was less than four months ago that India banned flights from the UK to stop the spread of the UK variant. \nNow, as the so-called 'Indian variant' is investigated, and case numbers there climb, it's the UK that is putting the brakes on the number of passengers coming in the opposite direction. \nIt shows how quickly dynamics between countries can change.\nWhen the Westminster government last added countries to the red list, including Bangladesh and Pakistan, at the start of April, it gave a week's notice. This time it's just over three days. \nDirect flights to and from India are already limited - a decision made by the Indian government in January - to 30 a week, meaning that many will now be rushing to book the last few seats before Friday.\nThe travel industry is still hoping that international travel from England will restart on 17 May, but today's announcement underlines that it will be a while until the world is open to us.  \nThe list of countries on the red list is getting longer rather than shorter.\nResponding to a question from shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, Mr Hancock said that surge Covid testing would happen in areas where cases of the India variant had been identified.\nLabour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, questioned why India was not put on the red list sooner, adding: \"Hong Kong this week have identified 47 Covid cases just on a single Delhi flight and we have still 16 more direct flights, many more indirect flights from India to here, before Friday alone.\"\nMr Hancock responded by saying that decisions on each country were \"kept under constant review\".\nThe announcement came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled a planned trip to India, which had been due to take place on 26 April, amid rising cases there.\nIndia has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April. Its capital Delhi has announced a week-long lockdown after a record spike in cases overwhelmed the city's healthcare system.\nIt comes as the UK recorded four deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures.\nIt is the lowest daily figure since 7 September, although the number of deaths recorded on Monday and over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays. \nThe data also showed there were also 2,963 new infections. Meanwhile, more than 10m people in the UK received a second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and nearly 33 million people have had their first dose. \nAll travellers returning to the UK must fill out a passenger locator form in advance, including details of their departure country and UK address. \nThey must also show proof of a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours before travelling to be allowed entry to the UK.\nIn England, a stay in a quarantine hotel costs \u00a31,750 per passenger travelling alone to cover transport, tests, food and accommodation.\nEvery additional adult, or child over 12, must pay \u00a3650, while children aged five to 12 pay \u00a3325.\nReturning travellers must take a Covid test on days two and eight of quarantine, at a cost of \u00a3210. \nA negative test result does not mean they can shorten their time in quarantine, but if they test positive, they must self-isolate for a further 10 days.\nNeither will they be able to end it early through the Test to Release scheme, where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five.\nRule-breakers face strict penalties - including prison sentences of up to 10 years.\nAre you trying to travel to India from the UK?

      "text": "Marks & Spencer has stepped up its caterpillar rights wrangle with Aldi after the discounter said its Cuthbert cake was returning for charity.\nAldi had stopped selling the cake in February, two months before M&S accused the supermarket of infringing its Colin the Caterpillar trademark.\nBut now sales of a limited edition version will benefit Teenage Cancer Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support.\nM&S said it loved a charity idea, but Aldi should use its own character.\nUnveiling the idea on social media, Aldi said: \"Let's raise money for charity, not lawyers.\"\nM&S replied that a cake based on Aldi's Kevin the Carrot commercials would be better, adding: \"That idea's on us.\"\nLast week, M&S lodged an intellectual property claim with the High Court. It said Cuthbert's similarity with its own Colin cake led consumers to believe they were of the same standard and \"rides on the coat-tails\" of M&S's reputation.\nThe retailer has three trademarks relating to Colin, which it believes means Colin has acquired and retains an enhanced distinctive character.\nRival supermarkets, which all sell caterpillar cakes of their own, remained tight-lipped in the face of the action by M&S, which said it had \"not ruled out\" pursuing other retailers as well.\nM&S said it wanted Aldi to agree not to sell anything similar in the future, but it clearly had not bargained on Aldi's latest cheeky charity-related move.\n\"Hey Marks and Spencer we're taking a stand against caterpillar cruelty. Can Colin and Cuthbert be besties?\" said Aldi on social media.\n\"We're bringing back a limited edition Cuthbert next month and want to donate all profits to cancer charities including your partners Macmillan Cancer Support and ours Teenage Cancer Trust,\" it said, using the Twitter hashtag #caterpillarsforcancer.\nAldi said it was calling on other supermarkets to join it in raising money for cancer charities through the sale of caterpillar cakes.\nM&S tweeted back: \"Hey @AldiUK we love a charity idea (Colin's been a BIG fundraiser for years). We just want you to use your own character. \n\"How about #kevinthecarrotcake ? That idea's on us... and we promise we won't do Keith.\"\nColin the Caterpillar was launched by M&S about 30 years ago. His appearance has been substantially unchanged since around 2004, except for adaptations for events such as Halloween and Christmas, and related products such as Connie the Caterpillar.\nColin is central to M&S's partnership with cancer charity Macmillan, and the retailer has created a Colin product for the annual World's Biggest Coffee Morning fundraising event.\nThe cake is a sponge with milk chocolate and buttercream, topped with chocolate sweets and a smiling white chocolate face.\nM&S was the first retailer to sell a caterpillar cake, but many supermarkets have since created their own similar products.\nOther cakes include Waitrose's Cecil, Sainsbury's Wiggles, Tesco's Curly and Asda's Clyde the Caterpillar.\n\"Aldi is known to sail close to the wind on creating products which look and/or sound incredibly similar to other brands,\" said Gary Assim, an intellectual property specialist at law firm Shoosmiths.\n\"M&S may find their case against Aldi difficult, since there are other caterpillar cakes on the market. They should have taken a zero-tolerance approach from the start if they felt that Colin and Connie were so important to them.\""

      "text": "A full breakdown of Covid-linked deaths in every Scottish care home has been published for the first time.\nThe data was released to BBC Scotland by the Crown Office unit set up to gather information on the circumstances of all Covid deaths in care homes.\nIt shows which homes and operators have been worst hit by the virus. \nThe care home industry claims it was \"let down\" at the start of the pandemic but the Scottish government said saving lives had always been its priority. \nThe Crown Office data, released under freedom of information laws, has been fed into this interactive dashboard to show every Covid-linked death by individual care home in Scotland. \nThe dashboard also allows people to view the homes with reported Covid deaths by council area and filter the affected homes by operator, and view contextual information such as historical complaints. \nThere have been more than 10,000 Covid-related deaths in Scotland and about a third have occurred in care homes. \nThe Crown Office has published a breakdown of every presumed and confirmed Covid death in a care home that has been reported to them. \nIt shows the prosecution service was considering at least 3,400 deaths linked to the virus as of 8 April. \nNational Records of Scotland (NRS) recorded 3,292 care home deaths over the same period. \nThe Crown Office's data - part of wider investigation to determine if the deaths should be the subject of a fatal accident inquiry or prosecution - is collated from a wider number of sources than the NRS figures.\nThe Crown Office data shows the Erskine Home facility in Erskine Ferry Road, Bishopton, recorded the largest number of Covid-related deaths (32).\nThe data also showed that some individual facilities accounted for a significant proportion of a council area's Covid-linked care home deaths. \nFor example, the 21 Covid-linked deaths at HC-One's Orchard Care Centre in Clackmannanshire account for 19% of that council area's total fatalities (110) for all residents. \nUnsurprisingly the larger providers - operating more homes often with more beds - reported larger numbers of deaths.\nHowever, an analysis of the data shows death rates for the bigger operators fall when averaging out the fatality count across the number of facilities they operate.  \nDeath rates in fact appear to be higher on average in homes where the provider owns one facility rather than a chain. \nFor example 25 deaths were reported in the one home operated by BUPA Care Homes, whereas the 195 deaths across Advinia's 11 homes averaged out to roughly 17 per residence.\nSimilarly there were 24 deaths in the one home run by Priory (Prestwick), while the 62 deaths across Erskine Hospital's four homes averaged out to approximately 15 per residence.\n\"I said I thought my mum was dying but they said they didn't think it was anything acute,\" says Ruth Gibson. \n\"I could see on our daily Skype calls that she was looking terrible - I don't know how they could have missed it.\"\nRuth's mum Anna Gibson was a resident at East Kilbride's Meldrum Gardens care home.\nThe 94-year-old died on 14 November last year - the day after testing positive for Covid as part precautionary testing undertaken in the home after a staff member caught the virus.\n\"I highlighted my mum wasn't well the week before she died but nobody was listening,\" says Ruth. \nMeldrum Gardens is run by South Lanarkshire Council and Ruth feels her complaints to them have been \"brushed under the carpet\".\nRuth said she had no idea five other residents had died from coronavirus at Meldrum Gardens until the release of the data to the BBC from the Crown Office.\n\"There's no transparency, and no one wants to get involved - they're hiding,\" she adds. \nVal de Souza, director of health and social care at South Lanarkshire Council, said: \"Mrs Gibson appears to have been very happy while living at Meldrum Gardens and we are clear that she received very good care there. \n\"Mrs Gibson was 94 and despite her positive Covid result her death was unexpected - indeed just two days earlier she was visited by medical staff who reported no concerns about her health.\n\"Following a complaint by the family, a full investigation was carried out in line with the Social Work Resources Complaints Handling Procedure. This found no issues with the level of care provided\".\nThe full picture on how many Covid-linked deaths there have been in each Scottish care home had been unclear since the start of the pandemic.\nThere is no statutory obligation for homes to notify residents, or their families, of an outbreak or deaths. \nSome operators, such as HC-One, released details proactively but others, both public and private, did not.\nIndustry regulator the Care Inspectorate also refused to release a breakdown, citing the \"significant impact\" on the commercial prospects of the operators if it did so.  \nThis meant some families where not aware of deaths in the homes where their loved ones lived. \nIn May last year, the Crown Office set up the Covid-19 Deaths Investigation Team (CDIT) to gather information on the circumstances of all deaths in care homes.\nSince then, all Covid-linked deaths of care home residents are reported to CDIT but the unit is also considering reports of deaths prior to May.\nThe reports come from a number of sources including GPs and Police Scotland.  \nCrown Office figures released to BBC Scotland show its CDIT team was considering 3,202 reports of confirmed and presumed Covid deaths as of 8 April.\nFor a further 198 care homes, the data shows between one and five Covid deaths have been recorded but the exact number has not been revealed for confidentiality reasons. \nIf it is assumed there is at least one death in these 198 homes then the tally comes to 3,400, but it could be higher. \nOver the same period, NRS reported 3,292 deaths of care home residents.\nThe data shows that the worst affected homes are located in parts of Scotland which had high transmission rates of the virus during the pandemic. \nSeparate Crown Office data shows that 824 of the reports relate to deaths which occurred before the creation of CDIT in May last year.\nThis was a period when elderly people were being discharged from hospital to care homes, a robust testing system was not in place and there was not a full understanding of asymptomatic transmission. \nOn Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon called for a UK-wide public inquiry into the pandemic by the end of the year, adding she would move ahead with a Scottish-only probe if that can't be agreed in good time. \nIt came as the first minister said, with the benefit of hindsight, mistakes were made with care home residents at the start of the crisis.\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman has also previously said the right precautions had not been taken when elderly people were being discharged from hospital to care homes.\nA spokesman for Scottish Care said the data \"demonstrates the terrible toll\" which has been felt by residents, families and care home workers over the past 13 months. \nHe added: \"We have heard in recent days acknowledgement that 'mistakes' were made in ensuring that care homes were as ready as they could be to receive the hundreds of people who were discharged from NHS hospitals. \n\"We very much regret that insufficient attention was given to the needs of the care sector when compared to the preparation given to and focus upon the NHS. \n\"Social care as a whole was let down in the early stages of the pandemic, not least by the failures to introduce testing of staff and residents earlier.\"\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said the Crown Office data was \"consistent with the findings\" of a Public Health Scotland report which \"did not find statistical evidence that hospital discharges of any kind were associated with care home outbreaks\".\nShe added: \"We mourn every death from Covid and express our sympathy for all those who have lost loved ones, and for the distress and grief experienced by individuals and their families.\n\"As the first minister and health secretary have previously said the Scottish government will continue to learn lessons from the Covid-pandemic and, subject to the outcome of the election, intends to have a full public inquiry which considers all aspects of how the pandemic has been handled, including the impact on care homes and their residents.\"\nThe spokeswoman added that \"saving people's lives has been and continues to be the priority of the Scottish government\" and the prioritisation of the vaccination programme in care homes means that since the peak in late January, deaths in care homes have fallen by 95%.\nA spokesman for the Crown Office said: \"CDIT is working together with other agencies including the Health and Safety Executive, local authorities and the Care Inspectorate to ensure that appropriate investigations are undertaken in relation to these deaths. \n\"These arrangements will ensure that the circumstances of each death can be fully considered by this dedicated team, and appropriate decisions made about any further investigation required, whether criminal or non-criminal.\"\nA spokeswoman for Erskine said the charity has \"operated within Scottish government guidelines and spared neither effort, nor resource in our whole team's valiant, year-long battle against this terrible virus.\" \nRobert Kilgour, chairman of Renaissance Care, pointed out his homes locked down two weeks ahead of the Scottish government's ordered closure. \nHe said: \"Since the middle of March last year, over 300 hospital patients have been discharged into our care, scores of whom were not tested for Covid in advance. \n\"That we have lost so many beloved residents, despite the many safeguards taken by staff and management, underlines how devastating Covid can be once it enters care homes.\"\nA spokesman for HC-One said it held different figures to those released by the Crown Office about Covid-linked deaths in its homes. \nHe added: \"We have worked tirelessly to protect our residents and colleagues, and took steps to lead on transparency throughout the pandemic. \n\"When little was known about the virus, HC-One published daily case numbers and death figures for its Scottish homes, and engaged at length and in detail with health and care officials, our families, and the media.\"\nA spokesman for Advinia pointed out its facilities are often more than four times larger than the average Scottish care home. \nHe added: \"All of our homes were as well prepared as they could have been at the time the pandemic started, and forward planning meant that we never faced a shortage of PPE.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Four Seasons Health Care Group said the virus \"quickly created immense challenges for all health and social care providers and while we acted immediately to protect everyone in our homes, it took time for the healthcare community to fully understand the characteristics of the spread of this infection\". \nA spokeswoman for Barchester said the \"teams within our homes have very high standards, and they are continuing to work tirelessly and relentlessly to do all they can to keep residents and staff safe from the virulent disease that is Covid\".

      "text": "A search for simple treatments for Covid that can be taken at home has been launched by Boris Johnson.\nThe PM said he hoped pills or capsules could be available by the autumn to help fight an anticipated third wave.\nThe aim would be to give them to people who have tested positive or exposed to someone who has.\nAn antiviral taskforce is being set up to oversee the work and future trials - as yet there are no treatments identified that could be used.\nFor the first time since September the latest figures show fewer than 2,000 Covid-19 patients in hospital.\nBut as he launched the new taskforce at a televised press briefing, Mr Johnson acknowledged soaring cases overseas and warnings from scientists that there will be another wave this year.\nHe said: \"As we look at what is happening in other countries, with cases now at record numbers around the world, we cannot delude ourselves that Covid has gone away.\n\"I see nothing in the data now that makes me think we are going to have to deviate in any way from the road map - cautious but irreversible - that we have set out.\n\"But the majority of scientific opinion in this country is still firmly of the view that there will be another wave of Covid at some stage this year.\n\"And so we must, as far as possible, learn to live with this disease as we live with other diseases.\"\nThe focus on antiviral treatment that can lessen the impact of an infection could be a vital tool when another wave of infections comes.\nWhile the rollout of Covid vaccines will lessen the wave, there will be people who remain unprotected either because the jab has not worked for them or they have not taken up the option.\nThrough the Recovery Trial run in hospitals, the UK has been at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely ill.\nBut now the government wants to help efforts to find treatments that stop people who are infected from becoming seriously ill in the first place.\nThere are thought to be a number of treatments that are being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating.\nIt is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the virus.\nBut at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a guarantee that it will actually happen.\nMr Johnson suggested that antivirals could be a third method of defence, along with vaccinations - including booster shots - and mass testing.\nThe antiviral taskforce will seek out new medicines to \"stop the virus in its tracks\", hopefully producing simple treatments that can be taken at home.\nIt is hoped that antivirals could help to reduce the severity of infections.\nMr Johnson said he hoped the move would help give \"ever greater confidence to the people of this country that we continue on our path towards freedom\".\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said antiviral drugs \"could help protect those not protected by or ineligible for vaccines. They could also be another layer of defence in the face of new variants of concern.\""

      "tags": "Travel,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "India's addition to the UK's \"red list\" of banned countries due to rising Covid cases and concerns over a new variant may have come too late, the UK's former chief scientific adviser has said.\nProf Mark Walport told the BBC he believed the new variant was \"more transmissible\" and there were \"good reasons\" for keeping it out of the UK.\nHealth officials say it is too early to know whether it is more transmissible.\nIndia has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April.\nIts capital Delhi announced a week-long lockdown after a record spike in cases overwhelmed the city's healthcare system.\nFrom 04:00 BST on Friday 23 April, most people who have travelled from India in the last 10 days will be refused entry to the UK.\nBritish or Irish passport holders, or people with UK residence rights, will be allowed in but must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to hold a coronavirus press briefing in Downing Street at 17:00 BST.\nHe will joined by the medical director of primary care for NHS England, Dr Nikita Kanani.\nOf the decision to put India on the UK's red list, Prof Walport told BBC Breakfast: \"These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth, but what's absolutely clear is that this variant is more transmissible in India.\"\nHe said he believed it was becoming the \"dominant variant\" in India, while there were also concerns it could be more effective at escaping a natural or vaccine-induced  immune response, \"so there's good reasons for wanting to keep it out of the country if at all possible\".\nThe Indian variant - officially known as B.1.617 - has been designated a \"variant under investigation\" in the UK, with 103 cases - almost all linked to travel - identified in Britain so far.\nProf Sharon Peacock, director of the UK's genetic surveillance programme, Covid-19 Genomics UK, said the variant had been around for \"some time\" and was first identified in October last year.\nShe said it was \"not clear at the present time\" whether it was \"the main driver\" for the wave of infections in India, but putting the country on the travel red list was necessary due to an \"upward trend\" in UK cases involving the variant.\nViruses change or mutate all the time, so the arrival of this new variant is not surprising. It's one of many thousands. But how worrying is it?\nChat with the experts and they will tell you \"watch this space\".\nCertainly, some of the genetic changes it's undergone might make it more contagious or able to escape some of the protection given by current vaccines or past Covid-19 infection.\nMore checks and tests are needed to know for sure.\nScientists are urgently studying its behaviour and spread to judge the threat.\nIt's possible it will need to be added to the UK government's variants of concern list, alongside the variants first seen in South Africa, Brazil and Kent.\nThese variants are on the list because evidence suggests they appear to transmit and infect more easily, may be riskier to health or might compromise vaccination efforts if left to run rampant.\nThere's no suggestion yet that the Indian variant will outcompete these or become dominant in the UK.\nMore than 100 cases of the Indian variant have been confirmed in the UK. That may sound like a large number, but it is less than 1% of the Covid samples that have been analysed for their genetic make-up in the UK.\nIn the meantime, keeping all cases of Covid down will help prevent illness and deaths while the vaccine rollout continues.\nNon-essential travel is banned from the UK and those arriving must quarantine. People can currently travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work.\nThe earliest date non-essential travel will be allowed from England, Scotland or Wales is 17 May, while Northern Ireland has not set a date.\nAll returning passengers must show proof of a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours before travelling - which can take the form of a printed document, email or text message.\nOn Tuesday, MPs heard that about 100 people are trying to enter England each day with a fake negative Covid certificate.\nLucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, which represents UK border and customs staff, told the All Party Parliamentary group on coronavirus that the documents are \"very easy\" to forge.\nAsked how many fakes could be slipping through the net, Ms Moreton said it is \"inherently unknowable\", adding that a lot of border and quarantine controls are based on \"trust\".\nShe told the committee that long queues found at airports could be a \"breeding ground\" for coronavirus.\nKirthi Mundhada and her husband Nishant Mehta travelled to Hyderabad, India, for her brother's wedding and to see her parents, who are unwell.\nThe couple, who live in Brighton, have return flights for 16 May and are now trying to find flights home before 23 April - which is when India is added to the red list.\nBut they say flights will cost between \u00a32,000 and \u00a36,000, which is money they do not have.\n\"It's so stressful,\" Kirthi, 35, says.\n \"I don't know what's going to happen with work and we have a mortgage and bills to pay. \n\"Hotel quarantine will cost us around \u00a32,500 and we don't have much money.\"\nVick Busa says he and his wife Isha had to travel to India with their two-year-old daughter Aahana for a family emergency.\nThe family, who are from Essex, were due to return to the UK last month, but after India started restricting flights, theirs was cancelled. \nVick, who is currently in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, tried to find flights returning before the new rules kick in, but says the family will now have to quarantine as their flights are not until 4 May.\nHe worries it will be \"very difficult\" being \"locked up in a room for 10 days with stringent rules\" with their young daughter.\nA briefing document drawn up by officials at Public Health England shows that between 25 March and 7 April, 3,345 arrivals from India were registered in UK border travel data. Of those 161 - or 4.8% - tested positive for Covid-19 after a PCR test.\nThe new travel rule applies to England and Scotland. There are currently no direct international flights into Wales or Northern Ireland.\nThe announcement came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled a planned trip to India, which had been due to take place on 26 April, amid rising cases there.\nMeanwhile the UK recorded a further 33 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 2,524 new infections, according to the latest government figures.\nThe data also showed that more than 33m people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while more than 10.4m have received both doses. \nHow will these new travel restrictions affect you?

      "text": "Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of \"undoing all the good\" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said.\nBeer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April.\nDr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases.\nThe Welsh government said it was taking \"a careful step-by-step approach\".\nDr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were \"frustrated\" at the different timetables out of lockdown.\nHowever, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope \"we can get back to normal by summer\".\n\"We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nMore than half the people in Wales have now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels.\nDr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life.\nOn Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shops reopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas.\n\"The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,\" he said.\nWhile he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a \"significant resurgence\".\nDr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate.\n\"We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,\" he said.\nOne landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was \"frustrating\" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoor hospitality opened on Monday in England.\nJohn Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened.\nBut Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was \"always two weeks behind England\" and he was anxious to open again.\nOn Monday, the border reopened between Wales and England and people are now allowed to travel in both directions.\nOnce in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households.\nHowever, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales.\nGarfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: \"After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better.\"\nSian Louise said: \"I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. \n\"Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually.\"\nMichelle Murphy commented: \"I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave.\"\nKerry Lea Edwards did not understand the \"urgency to be back in the pub\", adding: \"If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink.\n\"Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad.\"\nMr Turner said: \"The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well.\n\"An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England.\" \nHe added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of \"the weather element\".\nWhile he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up.\nHe said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. \n\"People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,\" he said.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were \"hugely disappointed\" to not open on Monday alongside England.\nShe said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was \"a bitter pill to swallow\". \nMs McClarkin said: \"Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space.\n\"The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good.\"\nThe Welsh government said it had provided more than \u00a32bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. \nA spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. \n\"Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,\" they said.\n\"Another \u00a3200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. \n\"Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen in Cardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend.\n\"A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election.\"\nLeader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant \"lost livelihoods in Wales\".\n\"After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,\" he said.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said: \"Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. \n\"If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.\" "

      "text": "The government has said it will do \"whatever it takes\" to prevent a breakaway European Super League involving six leading English clubs. \nBoris Johnson said ministers would be working to make sure the league did not go ahead in the way being proposed.\nThe Duke of Cambridge also said he shared fans' concerns about \"the damage it risks causing to the game we love\".\nBut the president of Real Madrid told a Spanish TV show: \"We are doing this to save football at this critical moment.\"\nFlorentino Perez, president of Real Madrid, said the decision to create the new league was in part taken because \"young people are no longer interested\" in the game.\nSpeaking for the first time since the league was announced, Mr Perez said: \"Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt.\"\nThe 12 founding members of the league, which includes Real Madrid plus three yet to join - would be permanent and never face relegation.\nSix English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league\nThey would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan.\nThe competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition.\nMatches would take place midweek and rival the existing Champions League.\nBut the president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, warned players who play for teams in the ESL would be \"banned from the World Cup and the Euros\".\nAs opposition to the plans gathered momentum, Prince William, President of the Football Association, said in a tweet: \"Now, more than ever, we must protect the entire football community - from the top level to the grassroots - and the values of competition and fairness at its core.\"\nAnd broadcaster Sky Sports said: \"We have not been involved in any discussions with the proposed breakaway European Super League.\"\n\"We are completely focused on supporting our long term football partners in the UK and in Europe, already providing fans with the best live action from the best football competitions in the world,\" the company added.\nIn a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden criticised the so-called \"big six\" English clubs for going \"against the very spirit of the game\".\nHe added club owners \"should remember that they are only temporary custodians of these clubs and that they forget fans at their peril\".\nMr Dowden said he had spoken to Uefa and the Football Association, who both oppose the move by the 12 clubs, adding that, \"if they can't act, we will\".\n\"We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening,\" he told MPs. \n\"We are examining every option from governance reform to competition law and mechanisms that allow football to take place.\n\"We will be reviewing everything Government does to support these clubs to play. We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game.\"\nA fan-led review, due to take place after the pandemic, has been brought forward because of the ESL announcement, Mr Dowden said. \nIt will be led by former sports minister Tracey Crouch and consider how fans can have an even greater say in the oversight of the game.\nThe review will also look at the finances of the men's and women's game, its governance and whether an independent football regulator should be set up.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was \"going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this (plan) doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed\".\nDowning Street said ministers were looking at a \"range of options\", including a German-style system of fan ownership of clubs and clawing back coronavirus support loans.\nBut Labour urged ministers to do more, with shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens saying it was \"time for the government to get off the subs bench and show some leadership on the pitch because we need reform of football\".\nShe added: \"It's not as if there's been a blockage here in Parliament preventing the government from taking action to sort the problems out.\"\nFans and pundits have expressed revulsion at what they claim would be an unfair competition that would lock many teams out of top European football.\nMatch of the Day host and former England footballer Gary Lineker said it was \"a time of great concern\", adding that if the ESL went ahead as planned, it would have \"massive ramifications\" on the domestic game.\n\"It will wreck the pyramid system (of leagues, promotion and relegation) that has been so important to local football clubs, communities and teams, and it takes out the competition.\" \nAround 68% of football fans strongly oppose the creation of the ESL, while only 14% support it, according to a YouGov survey of 1,730 fans. \nSome 700 football supporters gathered outside Leeds United's Elland Road ground ahead of the club's Premier League game against Liverpool to protest against the proposed new league. \n A Liverpool shirt was burned and a plane flew over the stadium displaying an anti-Super League message.\nInside the stadium Leeds players wore T-shirts saying 'Earn it' next to the Champions League logo and 'Football is for the fans'. A banner behind one goal had the same message.\nLaunching their plan, the 12 founding members of the ESL said the pandemic had \"accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model\".\nThey said there was a \"need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid\".\nBBC's Sports Editor Dan Roan said leading figures were insisting the Super League would generate much more money, not just for the clubs involved, but for the rest of the \"football family\". \nHe added they seemed \"very confident\" they were on a strong legal footing when it came to blocking any punishments threatened by bodies such as Uefa.\nEarlier, Manchester United's shares rose within minutes of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where they are traded.\nFifteen minutes after the trading day began, they were up around 8.5%. \nMeanwhile, Juventus's share price jumped by more than 14% on Monday morning.\nBut Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said he remained opposed to the idea of the league - despite his club agreeing to join it. \n\"I like the competitive aspect of football. I like that West Ham might play in the Champions League,\" he said, adding that he and his players did not know about the move before it happened. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Edinburgh,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Scottish restaurant owner has described new draft hospitality Covid guidance as a \"bombshell\".\nThe sector had expected that 1m (3ft) social distancing would apply between tables when it reopens next Monday.\nBut the new proposals state people from different households will now have to observe social distancing at tables.\nThe government said it had worked with industry and unions to ensure its guidance was \"evidence-based, fair and ethical, clear and realistic\". \nWhen Scotland moves to level three next Monday\u00a0the hospitality sector will be able to sell alcohol outdoors to a maximum group of six people from six households.\nThe sale of alcohol indoors will not be permitted, however, a maximum of six people from two households will be able to meet indoors and premises will close at 20:00.\u00a0\u00a0 \nCarina Contini, co-owner of Cantini restaurants in Edinburgh, said she was feeling \"really optimistic\" until the new guidance was published at 18:00 on Friday.\nShe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"They have thrown us an absolute bombshell, an absolutely impossibility in terms of reopening.\n\"The bookings that we have already got we will have to phone up and say 'I'm sorry we can't honour your booking because we can't host this level of capacity'.\"\nMs Contini said she would also have to let down suppliers and her staff.\nShe added: \"It is absolutely going to be crippling for the sector.\"\nShe said the rules were completely impractical.\n\"If I was catering for six people at a table, I would have to have a table that is 3.5m (11ft) long,\" she said. \n\"There is not a restaurant supplier in the country that makes tables that are 3.5m long.\n\"Elderly couples who may be hard of hearing are going to have to FaceTime themselves over lunch because the distance is so far away.\"\nMs Contini also criticised the short notice, ahead of the sector's planned reopening next Monday, and urged the Scottish government to reconsider.\nShe added: \"These regulations are now more harmful, more dangerous to our business than Covid itself.\"\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, emphasised that the guidance was draft.\nShe told Good Morning Scotland: \"It is extremely important that the sector have the opportunity to comment, to express their concerns and to see what is feasible for them.\n\"I imagine the reason the 1m requirement between different household members is in place is to provide additional protection but the government has to balance up additional harms at the moment.\"\nMeanwhile, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of an \"impending unemployment tsunami\" and said a majority of businesses had run out of money to pay furlough contributions and fixed costs.\nIt also highlighted a recent survey of its members which found the average Covid-related debt was \u00a3150,000 or more per premises.\nNTIA spokesman Gavin Stevenson said: \"Many of our members have been closed for over a year now, and virtually all have suffered crippling financial losses. \n\"In short, the money going out every month has been far greater than the money coming in, and government support has typically covered less than a quarter of this deficit.\"\n\"To add insult to injury government support has now ended while there is no end date to forced closure and other restrictions.\"\nHe called on the Scottish government to provide \"substantial and immediate\" additional support for as long as businesses remain closed and operate under \"unviable\" restrictions.\nAlternatively, he said his members needed a \"clear route map\" with target dates for the end of all legal restrictions on capacity, activity and opening hours.\nThe Scottish government said the draft guidance \"may be amended subject to comments received to take into account engagement with stakeholders.\"\nA spokesman added: \"The requirement to physical distance has been established for some time and businesses are already following existing sectoral advice on this. The draft guidance builds on that but does not introduce significant change.\"\nHe added that it would help businesses due to open next week do so \"as safely as possible\" and provided guidance on how business owners could calculate maximum capacity on their premises.\nLast week hospitality and tourism leaders in Scotland criticised the Covid restrictions which prevent the sector from reopening.\nAnd they warned that waiting two weeks before reopening would come at a cost to Scotland's economy of \u00a320m.\nThey were speaking as England's lockdown rules eased further, with pub gardens and restaurants among the places able to reopen.\nSouth of the border people can now visit bars and restaurants outdoors but must either follow the rule of six, or be in a group of any size with no more than two households present. Tables must be socially distanced.\nThe First Minister is set to confirm what she's been signalling for some time - hospitality will re-open in Scotland next Monday, April 26.\nThere will be restrictions on the industry, and one measure that many owners find frustrating is one metre social distancing.\nThis is the same rule that was in place last year. It means there should be one metre between any customers who are not part of the same household, even if they are at the same table. \nIt's not hard to work out why this isn't popular with some industry figures - social distancing (even at one metre) means fewer customers can fit in.\nBut the virus is still circulating, and measures like this are designed to lower transmission risk.\nOther changes scheduled for April 26 should go ahead as planned. Gyms and shops will re-open, and travel between Scotland, England and Wales should be possible. But it's unlikely further changes will be accelerated."

      "tags": "Belfast,NI Health,Neurology",
      "text": "Almost 20% of patients seen by neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt were given a wrong diagnosis, a report has found.\nA review of 927 of Dr Watt's high-risk patients found 181 people received a diagnosis described as \"not secure\", Health Minister Robin Swann said.\nHe was speaking as the Belfast Trust announced the recall of a further 209 neurology patients seen and discharged by Dr Watt between 1996 and 2012.\nThis is the third such recall.\nDr Watt was at the centre of Northern Ireland's biggest patient recall linked to his work at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.\nMr Swann said he had met patients and families affected by the recall in October last year.\n\"While this report is statistical in nature, it deals with individuals, their families and their experiences,\" he said.\n\"I know that many will have had their confidence in our health service shaken and I remain committed to helping restore it.\"\nMr Swann \"unreservedly apologised\" to those patients who have been affected.\n\"I also want to acknowledge that in announcing a further recall, more patients will be affected,\" he said. \n\"It is deeply regrettable that this experience should happen to any of our patients and it is even more so when I consider the total number of patients involved.\"\nIn May 2018, the Belfast Trust recalled 2,500 patients for review after concerns were raised about the clinical work carried out by Dr Watt. \nThis was followed by a further 1,044 patients who were recalled in November 2018. \nThe RQIA regulatory body is also conducting a review into patient deaths.\nAn independent inquiry was elevated to a statutory public inquiry late last year but has yet to start hearing evidence. \nThose affected by this latest recall were seen and discharged between 1996, when Dr Watt began his career, and 2012 and who are taking certain prescribed medications for specific neurological conditions.\nThe Belfast Trust said those affected would have received a letter asking them to set up a telephone review to ascertain whether the medication is appropriate for their condition.\nExtra clinics have been set up to facilitate face-to-face interviews where necessary.\nBelfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack said she was \"truly sorry\" over the further recall.\n\"I absolutely understand that this will cause worry and anxiety to a number of people and their families and I am deeply sorry for that,\" she said. \n\"I also accept this next stage may be very difficult for those patients who have already been reviewed and whose diagnoses may have been changed as a result of our two previous recalls.\n\"Again, I want to express the trust's sincere regret for all the hurt and pain caused over the last number of years and for the harm that has undoubtedly been done.\n\"It is absolutely imperative that we put right any past wrongs and while this is painful, it is vital we assure ourselves that former patients, now discharged and who are taking very specific medication, are taking it for the correct reasons.\"\nUlster Independent Clinic and Hillsborough Private Clinic are recalling 57 and 10 former patients respectively.\nSeparately, the trust also reviewed case notes of 66 patients who had a blood patch procedure under the care of Dr Watt and who did not have a clinical review as part of the recall process.\nIt found that for 45 patients there was no clinical evidence to support that a blood patch was required.\nAnd, for 46 patients the care was unsatisfactory and fell below the standard expected by the trust.\n\"We are deeply sorry for this and for the undue hurt these patients experienced,\" the trust added.\nColm Gildernew, who chairs the health scrutiny committee at Stormont. described it as a scandal that has caused immense distress. \n\"The neurology inquiry has revealed again more examples of a lack of transparency, deficits in governance arrangements and accountability within the health service,\" he said.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member asked what lessons had been learned?\nMeanwhile DUP assembly member Pam Cameron, deputy chair of the committee, asked about a timetable and scale of resource for financial redress for those entitled to compensation.\nMr Swann could not provide a definitive date but added: \"Redress payments will be paid because this is a failure of our systems that has to be corrected.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Wales business,Welsh government,Welsh Parliament election 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Six people from six households will be able to meet outdoors in Wales from Saturday.\nThe easing of the lockdown rules also mean that from next week pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to re-open to serve customers al-fresco.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was guided by the fact there is lower risk of catching Covid outdoors.\nIt comes after the Welsh government announced gyms could reopen earlier than previously planned.\nCurrently, up to six people from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet outdoors, although children under the age of 11 or carers do not count in the total.\nThe new rule means any six people can meet outdoors, with children under 11 and carers exempt from the rule.\nIt brings Wales roughly in line with England and Scotland, although England does not allow an exemption for children.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Because meeting outdoors continues to be lower risk than meeting indoors, we are able to bring forward changes to allow any six people to meet outdoors.\n\"This will provide more opportunities for people, especially young people, to meet outdoors with their friends. This will undoubtedly have a significant positive impact on people's well-being.\"\nKelly Jolliffe, landlady of the Greyhound Inn and Hotel in Usk, said she was \"very excited\" to re-open, adding she can seat 160 people in her beer garden.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Ms Jolliffe said: \"We don't make masses of profit, but it's about getting people back in here. \n\"Getting the team kind of match fit, if you like, ready to be able to open indoors as well, because it takes probably four to six weeks to get us all back up and running properly.\"\nShe said the phone had been \"ringing off the hook\" with customers wanting to make bookings.\n\"People have just been so supportive and also they're being flexible. What's fabulous is they're phoning and saying, 'Whenever you can fit us in. We know you're going to be busy, so it doesn't have to be a certain time, doesn't have to be a certain table, just fit us in when it suits you'.\"\nDavid Morgan, landlord of the Cross Inn in Maesteg, said that while the new rules were a positive move, but he still had concerns.\nHe said: \"Everything's still vague. We know six people can meet outside -- we found that on Wales Online this morning and the pubs are definitely opening. \n\"What about the other regulations? Do we still do track and trace? We know nothing and we won't find out anything until Thursday. \n\"I've been phoning my main suppliers and the rep there, she's been giving me all of the information. There's other independent brewers I've been picking stuff up off. We've had very little from the government and the council.\n\"We're apprehensive. It all depends on if people come out, when they come out, how they're going to react to coming out because they've been taught how to drink in the house with cheap booze.\"\nEarlier this month, Mr Drakeford announced gyms would reopen earlier than planned - on 3 May instead of 10 May.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the move should have happened \"weeks ago and would've happened in the Welsh Conservative roadmap out of lockdown\".\n\"Labour's insistence on playing politics, rather than following the science, has tragically left Wales with the longest lockdown, worst economic impact and highest death rate in the UK,\" he said.\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: \"This is obviously good news for the hospitality sector which has been so hard hit by Covid, especially during this current lockdown.\n\"I want the Welsh government to ensure that financial support remains for those bars and restaurants who do not have outdoor seating and am calling for support to be given to those businesses who are only able to partially open.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth added: \"This confirmation will be welcome news for some businesses, but many rely on indoor hospitality for their financial viability.\n\"With favourable prevailing conditions, indoor hospitality should be allowed to reopen on May 17th to put the spring back in the step of Welsh business.\"\nWelsh Labour said it had nothing to add to the Welsh government statement.\nWales' Covid case rate has been the lowest of the UK nations since 26 January. It currently stands at 15.9 cases per 100,000.\nOnly 1.7% of Covid tests now result in a positive result - the lowest in Wales since 3 September.\nThe number of \"active\" Covid patients in hospital on Sunday, 105, is also the lowest since the pandemic began, while numbers in critical care with Covid are in single figures for the first time since early September.\nWales is also ahead of the other UK nations in the proportion of people given first and second doses of a Covid vaccine.

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "Derek Chauvin, the former police officer filmed kneeling on George Floyd's neck before he died, is on trial in Minneapolis. \nSince Mr Floyd's arrest and death on 25 May, the 19-year police veteran has remained largely out of the spotlight and free on bail.\nMr Chauvin will be the first of the four officers involved in the incident to stand trial. Jury selection began on 9 March.\nHe is facing the most serious charges of the four, including second-degree murder. Mr Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nThe others are charged with aiding and abetting Mr Chauvin's alleged crimes. \nHe is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors are also seeking to add a charge of third-degree murder.\nLegal experts say that third-degree murder carries a lesser sentence, but it is easier to prove in court.\nTo prove second-degree murder, prosecutors must convince jurors that a serious assault had been committed by Mr Chauvin, and that it was a \"substantial causal factor\" in Mr Floyd's death.\nThird-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove that Mr Chauvin showed a reckless disregard for human life, but not prove that an assault led to the death.\nIn an unrelated case filed after Mr Floyd's death, prosecutors charged Mr Chauvin and his wife with underpaying taxes for six years. They have pleaded not guilty to nine charges against them. Each charge carries a sentence of five years in prison.\nMr Chauvin, 44, was the most senior officer involved in Mr Floyd's arrest, having served for almost two decades with the Minneapolis Police Department.\nHis record of policing included both commendations and complaints about conduct.\nIn 2006, Mr Chauvin was recommended for a medal of valour for his role in the shooting of a man who aimed a shotgun at officers.\nThere have been at least 15 conduct complaints against him, the Star Tribune reported, citing records from the Minneapolis Police Department's Internal Affairs. Most of the complaints were closed without discipline.\nMr Chauvin's personal files were heavily redacted, but there are details of one complaint from 2007. \nIt concerns allegations Mr Chauvin pulled a woman from her car and frisked her after she was caught driving 10mph (16 km/h) over the speed limit. \nA report found Mr Chauvin did not record audio of the incident and failed to switch his dashboard camera on during the stop.\nHe was disciplined for this complaint and one other, receiving a letter of reprimand on both occasions, records show.\nMr Chauvin served two stints in the US Army prior to his career with the police. He was a member of the military police from September 1996 to February 1997, and again from September 1999 to May 2000.\nHis other previous jobs include security guard and McDonald's employee.\nThe day after Mr Chauvin's arrest, a lawyer for his wife Kellie said she had filed for divorce.\n\"She is devastated by Mr Floyd's death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy,\" her lawyer said in a statement.\nAfter Mr Floyd's death, the owner of a nightclub in Minneapolis revealed that the two men had worked alongside each other every Tuesday night.\nMaya Santamaria, the owner of El Nuevo Rodeo said Mr Floyd worked security inside the club, while Mr Chauvin was paid while off duty to sit inside his squad car outside the club and occasionally help remove unruly patrons.\n\"I wouldn't characterise them as knowing each other,\" she told CNN, adding that \"they would have crossed paths\".\nLawyers for Mr Floyd's family had argued that Mr Chauvin's alleged past relationship with Mr Floyd played a role in his death. \nAn employee at the club initially claimed that the two men regularly \"butted heads\", but later said he had mistaken Mr Floyd for another black worker.\nOn 7 October 2020, a judge agreed to free Mr Chauvin on $1m bail, pending trial. He had been held since May at a maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota.\nConditions of his bail include Mr Chauvin not contacting Mr Floyd's family, surrendering his firearms and not working in law enforcement or security as he awaits trial.\nIn February, US media reported that former US Attorney General Bill Barr quashed a potential plea deal that would have seen Mr Chauvin spend 10 years behind bars in exchange for pleading guilty.\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Barr, a Trump appointee, felt the deal was would be perceived as too lenient, and wanted state officials to be make their own decisions regarding Mr Chauvin's prosecution.\nThe 46-year-old was arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill.\nHe was handcuffed, but when officers tried to put him into the squad car he resisted and a struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street.\nMr Chauvin, 44, kneeled on Mr Floyd's back and neck for more than nine minutes, according to prosecutors. Three other officers assisted Mr Chauvin.\nMr Floyd said he could not breathe more than 20 times. The video shows him go limp and get carried away by police.\nHe was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later."

      "text": "Scotland's unemployment rate from December 2020 to February 2021 remained at 4.4%.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the employment rate, for those aged 16 to 64, over the same period was 74.6%.\nThis was up 0.2% on the previous quarter.\nThere were 2.567 million people aged 16-64 in employment between December and February, while 120,000 in that age range were unemployed.\nDarren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: \"The latest figures suggest that the jobs market has been broadly stable in recent months after the major shock of last spring.\" \nUK-wide, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9%.\nAccording to the ONS, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago.\nIt said young people continued to bear the brunt of the crisis, amid large-scale job losses in sectors such as hospitality and retail.\nPeople under 25 accounted for more than half of the payroll jobs lost in the year to March, it said - some 436,000 positions.\nNiamh Welsh, who lives in Paisley, is a student but prior to the pandemic had been working part time in retail. She was furloughed, then lost her job earlier this year and has struggled to find other work.\n\"I've been working since I was about 13, doing paper rounds, and then I properly started working when I was about 15 years old, so I've been working for the last eight years or so,\" she says.\n\"So I would have thought it would have been a little bit easier, but just with the situation it's quite hard to find places that are taking on staff, as most places have been laying off staff or cutting down hours.\n\"Even all the supermarkets, which I have experience of, barely any of them have any positions at all.\"\nNiamh is due to graduate this summer and had hoped to work and save money in order to return to education.\n\"This year I was planning to make some money but that's tricky if I can't find a job. \n\"I want to stay here but I've got a flat to pay for, bills to pay, food, all that stuff, but I also want to be able to save.\"\nStuart McIntyre, head of research at the Fraser of Allander economic institute, said the latest data suggested some \"worrying trends\" were emerging.\nHe said: \"The number of young people who are unemployed has jumped by 15,500 over the last year, with the youth unemployment rate rising from 8.3% to 13.5%. \n\"The closure of large parts of the hospitality and retail economy through the pandemic, sectors where many young people find work, is clearly feeding through.\" \nDr McIntyre also said the north east of Scotland continued to experience a much larger decline in payroll employment than elsewhere in Scotland, as a result of the combined effect of the downturn in oil and gas and wider effects of the pandemic. \nHe added: \"Coupled with the recent announcement of the closure of John Lewis in Aberdeen, it is clear that this is one part of the Scottish economy that is facing particularly acute challenges.\"\nUnprecedented measures to avoid a rise in unemployment, including the furlough scheme, have kept down the number of people looking for jobs at only 4.4% of the Scottish adult workforce.\nThat's the same in December to February as in the preceding autumn months and below the UK figure, which fell slightly.\nThe number in work was up, but remained below the UK rate, and the claimant count was little changed at 212,000 people, depending on benefits linked to unemployment or low pay.\nThat figure nearly doubled at the start of the pandemic.\nThe number of Scots in payrolled jobs dropped by 73,000 in the year to last month.\nLess robust figures from the ONS suggest job vacancies across the UK rose in March and that may have accelerated this month."

      "text": "Jim Steinman, the colourful composer behind hits like Bat Out Of Hell and Total Eclipse Of The Heart, has died at the age of 73.\nHis brother Bill told the Associated Press that the songwriter and producer had died of kidney failure on Monday after being ill for some time.\n\"I miss him a great deal already,\" he added.\nSinger Meat Loaf, with whom Steinman scored his biggest hits, said goodbye with the words: \"Fly Jimmy Fly\". \nBonnie Tyler also paid tribute, saying she was \"absolutely devastated\" by news of her friend's death.\nOutside of music, \"he was also a funny, kind, supportive, and deeply caring human being,\" the Welsh singer wrote.\n\"The world is a better place for his life and his work and a worse one for his passing.\"\nKnown for his bombastic, operatic compositions, Steinman hit the big time in 1977 with the Meat Loaf album Bat Out Of Hell.\nStyled as a rock opera, it contained hits like You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth and Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad as well as the title track - and became one of the biggest albums of all time, with more than 50 million copies sold around the world.\nThe high-camp, over-the-top production was often imitated but never bettered - including by Steinman himself, although he came close on Bat Out Of Hell's 1993 sequel, which spawned the worldwide number one single, I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That).\nHe later won the album of the year Grammy for his work on Celine Dion's Falling Into You; and worked on Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, Whistle Down The Wind, which opened in the West End in 1998.\nThe Bat Out Of Hell album trilogy received its own stage musical in 2017, with every song penned by Steinman. \nAnd while rock critics often looked down upon his extravagant and expansive style, the composer remained nonplussed.\n\"If you don't go over the top, how are you ever going to see what's on the other side?\" he once asked.\n\"There is no other songwriter ever like him,\" Meat Loaf said as Steinman was inducted to the Songwriters' Hall Of Fame in 2012. \n\"I can never repay him. He has been such an influence, in fact, the biggest influence on my life, and I learned so much from him that there would be no way I could ever repay Mr Jim Steinman.\"\nAmong the composer's other famous hits were Bonnie Tyler's Holding Out For A Hero, Barry Manilow's Read 'Em And Weep, Air Supply's Making Love Out Of Nothing at All and the Cher/Meat Loaf duet Dead Ringer For Love.\nBorn and raised in New York, Steinman started his career in musical theatre, writing a score for a college production of Bertolt Brecht's A Man's a Man in 1968.\nHe followed that up with an original musical, The Dream Engine, which he later described as \"a three-hour rock epic with tons of nudity\". \nThe show, in which he also starred, caught the attention of a Broadway producer, who offered him a job at New York's Public Theater upon graduation. \nThere, he worked on several projects, including an adaptation of Wagner's Das Rheingold. But his first big success came when Yvonne Elliman recorded his song Happy Ending for her 1973 album Food of Love. \nThe same year, an actor called Marvin Lee Aday auditioned for Steinman's musical More Than You Deserve. The pair struck up a close friendship and, after Aday changed his name to Meat Loaf, they started work on the Bat Out Of Hell project.\nIt took several years to complete, and was rejected by four record labels. But when it was finally released in 1977, it became an immediate success in the UK and Australia. US fame followed a year later, after Meat Loaf performed on Saturday Night Live.\nDespite the record's success, Steinman maintained that his best song was Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse Of The Heart.\n\"That song never goes away. It's the biggest karaoke song in the world and it's been covered dozens of times,\" he told iHeartRadio in 2017. \"It's one of my children and I'm as proud of it as I am the others. I try not to play favourites but yeah, it's special.\"\nHe had several fallings out with Meat Loaf over the years, which often ended up in the court room, but they reconciled just as frequently, last working together on the 2016 album Braver Than We Are.\nA statement posted on Steinman's Facebook page confirmed the composer's death.\n\"There will be much more to say in the coming hours and days as we prepare to honour this giant of a human being and his glorious legacy,\" it read. \n\"For now, do something that makes you feel young, happy and free. He'd want that for you!\"\nHis manager David Sonenberg said Steinman suffered a stroke four years ago and that his health had recently been declining.\nCeline Dion also paid tribute, calling the composer a \"musical genius\".\n\"Having the opportunity to work with him was one of the greatest privileges of my career,\" she said. \"My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced an anti-viral taskforce to investigate Covid treatments that could be taken at home, as he warned there will likely be \"another wave of Covid at some stage this year\" in the UK. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, he said anti-viral treatments could be a part of the UK's defence against Covid, as \"we will have to live with this disease\". Also at the briefing, Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, said uptake of the vaccine among ethnic minority backgrounds had tripled since February, outpacing the national average across all ethnicities.  \nBlood clots should be listed as a \"very rare\" side-effect of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, the EU's drug regulator has said. The European Medicines Agency said it had found a \"possible link\" between the jab and clots, but added that the benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine outweighed the risks. Earlier this month, the EMA made the same recommendation for the Covid-19 vaccine produced by Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nThe UK's decision to add India to the red list of banned countries may have been made too late, the UK's former chief scientific adviser has said. The announcement about India was made on Monday after 103 cases of a new variant from India were detected in the UK. Prof Mark Walport told the BBC: \"These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth, but what's absolutely clear is that this variant is more transmissible in India.\" Meanwhile, around 100 people are trying to enter the country each day with a \"fake Covid certificate\", MPs have heard. Read our explainers here about why India was not already on the red list and more on the Indian and other variants.\nThe jobs crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic continues to most badly affect the young, official figures have shown. In the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these losses. The ONS said younger people were suffering disproportionately because sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. \nThe most significant stage of Scotland's lockdown easing will take place as planned on Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Hospitality venues, gyms and non-essential shops will reopen while non-essential travel with England, Wales and Northern Ireland will also be allowed for the first time this year. Mrs Sturgeon said life should look \"much more like normality\" during July. Read our pieces on what rules are changing and we answer readers' questions here about coming out of lockdown here. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAfter India was placed on the UK's travel \"red list\", remind yourself which other locations are subject to travel bans and quarantine.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Tory MP Johnny Mercer says he was \"forced\" to resign as a defence minister over the treatment of veterans who served in Northern Ireland.\nNo 10 confirmed his exit on Tuesday - ahead of the Overseas Operations Bill returning to the Commons on Wednesday.\nThe new law is designed to protect veterans from unfounded prosecutions.\nBut British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland will be excluded from the bill. Mr Mercer called that a \"red line\" for him staying in government.\nIn response, Boris Johnson said the government was \"committed to doing more over the coming months, including for those who have served in Northern Ireland\".\nA No 10 spokesperson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had \"accepted\" Mr Mercer's resignation and thanked him for his service as a minister.\nBut posting a resignation letter on Twitter immediately afterwards, Mr Mercer said he had been \"relieved of my responsibilities in government\".\nThe MP - who is a former Army captain - wrote that the government had \"abandoned people in a way I simply cannot reconcile\" in allowing \"endless investigations\" into historic killings to continue. \nHe added: \"Veterans are being sectioned, drinking themselves to death and dying well before their time, simply because the UK government cannot find the moral strength or courage we asked of them in bringing peace to Northern Ireland in finding a political solution to stop these appalling injustices.\"\nPlans were announced last year by the government to restrict the number of Troubles killings which could be fully investigated under a new approach where \"new, compelling evidence\" would be required.\nBut the Overseas Operations Bill would go further for other veterans, such as those who served in Iraq or Afghanistan, proposing a five-year limit on criminal prosecutions. \nSix former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are currently facing prosecution. \nIn 2019, the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland said of 32 \"legacy cases\" it had ruled on since 2012, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five were connected to the Army.\nIn his letter, Mr Mercer said \"no discernible efforts have been made\" to introduce similar legislation to cover Northern Ireland veterans, despite previous pledges, adding: \"I can see no prospect of this changing.\"\nThe Tory MP said he was \"deeply proud of my predecessors who served in Northern Ireland\", adding they were \"not second-class veterans\" and deserved \"the protection of the Overseas Operations Bill like everyone else\".\nNo 10 later shared a letter from the PM to Mr Mercer, thanking him for \"highlighting the importance of legislating to protect our Armed Forces against vexatious and repeated claims\". \nMr Johnson wrote: \"The conclusion of the enactment of the Overseas Operations Bill is a crucial part of that, addressing veterans who have served overseas. \n\"But we are committed to doing more over the coming months, including for those who have served in Northern Ireland.\"\nWhile the government has not moved on Mr Mercer's calls, it has changed course over another contentious part of the bill, ahead of the debate on Wednesday. \nThe law had come under fierce criticism by human rights groups, former military commanders and lawyers for including a \"presumption against prosecution\" after the five-year time frame for the most serious of crimes - namely torture, genocide and crimes against humanity. \nLabour's Lord Roberts brought an amendment to the bill in the House of Lords to ensure the rule does not apply for those actions, which won the support of peers. \nAnd now, ahead of the debate, the Ministry of Justice has conceded to the amendment, promising to exclude torture, genocide and crimes against humanity from the rule.\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said: \"Whilst we maintain nothing in this bill prevents those accused of breaking the law from being prosecuted, we have listened to concerns, and in order to send a powerful message to the international community, amendments will be made to the Overseas Operations Bill.\"\nHowever, the department confirmed it would seek to overturn three other amendments agreed by peers earlier this month.

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Welsh Parliament election 2021,Welsh Conservatives,Income tax",
      "text": "The Welsh Conservatives have vowed to cut income tax if a target to create 65,000 new jobs is met by 2025.\nThe party said it would cut the basic rate by 1% before the next Senedd election in five years time.\nIt comes as the Tories launched their Senedd election manifesto in Wrexham. Pledges include an M4 relief road and ending business rates for small firms.\nSenedd group leader Andrew RT Davies said Wales needed a \"critical national mission\" for the economy.\nThe Welsh Conservatives will be defending 11 seats when voters go to the polls on 6 May.\nIt was the third-largest party at the previous Senedd election, but at the UK general election in December 2019 it gained six constituencies from Labour, giving the party the best result in Wales since the days of Margaret Thatcher.\nThe party also promised to build five new or upgraded hospitals, 100,000 new homes and provide extra funding for the NHS every year.\nA \u00a310 minimum wage for social care workers is pledged, Natural Resources Wales would be scrapped and Cardiff Airport sold off.\nWALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nThe Conservatives' manifesto says it would be the party's \"national mission\" to create 65,000 new jobs.\nThe document says the party would cut the basic rate of tax once the new jobs had been created, but does not specify the size of a cut. \nA press release for the party says it would be a 1p cut in the \u00a31 on the basic rate - currently a total of 20% for earnings between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270 a year.\nThere were 2.1m basic rate taxpayers in 2020/21.\nAsked how the tax cut would be funded, a party spokesman said: \"By having more people paying into the pot, we can reduce the amount of money everyone puts in, so that people can spend more money in their local economy, creating more jobs in return.\"\nThe policy suggests the Conservatives would make the tax cut in the last financial year before the next Senedd election in 2026, provided the jobs target is met.\nManifesto pledges on tax include a freeze for council tax for at least the next two years, and cutting the Welsh version of stamp duty, called land transaction tax (LTT).\nThe changes would mean first time buyers would not pay LTT, while the threshold for others would be raised to \u00a3250,000.\nSince 2019 Welsh ministers have been able to vary income tax rates from those set by the UK government by up to 10p in the pound.\nThis money, along with some other taxes collected in Wales and cash from Westminster, funds Welsh public services run from Cardiff.\nThe income tax powers have so far not been used.\nLabour, which has been leading the Welsh government since the start of devolution, vowed at the last election not to raise taxes.\nIn its manifesto this year the party changed tack, only ruling out a tax rise until the economy recovered from the impact of Covid.\nGuto Ifan from Cardiff University estimated that in 2025 a cut of 1p to the basic rate would cost around \u00a3220m.\n\"There are huge post-pandemic spending pressures and UK gov spending plans have already been reined back significantly. There are difficult trade-offs facing the next Welsh Government, and tax cuts will need to be balanced against these,\" he tweeted.\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nThe Conservatives said they would invest \u00a32bn to create modern infrastructure for Wales, including the M4 relief road which was scrapped by the Welsh government in 2019 and was then estimated to cost \u00a31.6bn.\nThe cash would also be used to upgrade the A55 and A40 and to create 20,000 charging points for electric vehicles.\nOn Radio Wales Breakfast Mr Davies denied there was a contradiction between his road plans and the UK government's plans to accelerate cuts in carbon emissions.\n\"The carbon engine is disappearing out of the transport system,\" he said, \"because by 2030 it will be illegal to sell petrol and diesel engines and they'll be phased out by 2035.\"\n\"So we're moving to an environmentally friendly mode of transport here in Wales and indeed across the United Kingdom, and it's incumbent on any government to make sure we put that investment in the green infrastructure.\"\n\"It's really important that we have a big sign that says open for business to people so that we can create these 65,000 jobs that ultimately would be rewarded with a tax cut at the end of the parliament,\" he said.\nHe said 15,000 of the 65,000 jobs would be in \"green jobs\".\n\"Many of those jobs would be engineering jobs,\" he said, in installing charging points, and in \"developing green energy projects and concepts around Wales\".\nOther pledges include: \nThe Conservatives are the only party in this election that is proposing cutting the Welsh rate of income tax.\nBut it's actually less of a cut than what the party suggested back in 2016, when Andrew RT Davies said the Tories would aim for cutting the basic rate by 2p.\nTuesday's plan also depends on a rise in the number of jobs, and it's also not baked into the manifesto itself.\nIt might be surprising how limited it is when Mr Davies had, years ago, sacked some of his frontbench because they disagreed with the powers being devolved to do this.\nBut it perhaps reflects how difficult it is in 2021 to promise tax cuts.\nEspecially when Mr Davies' party colleagues at the other end of the M4 are suggesting the opposite, with a million more across the UK expected to enter the basic tax bracket in the next five years.\nLeaders debate:  If you would like to be part of the virtual audience for the BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders Debate on 29 April, please email us your details to waleslive@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "tags": "Fifa,Companies",
      "text": "Sports fans love a bit of jeopardy - a nail biting contest which can end in glory or defeat. But business owners generally hate all of that. \nOwners and business managers of football clubs have a peculiar problem.\nAs one former chief executive of a Premier League club told me: \"I won't know till the last day of the season if my budget for next year is going to be \u00a3170m or \u00a370m.\"\nThat is not only almost impossible to manage, it has another very important consequence. Businesses with steady revenues are worth a lot more than ones with erratic earnings.\nIn business terms it's known as getting a higher \"multiple\" - volatile businesses are worth as little as five times average annual earnings, whereas steady ones are worth up to 20 times or more.\nThis is what the European Super League is all about - making the clubs involved worth more by eliminating the jeopardy of being relegated or missing out on Champions League qualification.\nThis is the moment many football team owners have been waiting for - particularly the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal - who know for themselves how much more stable and therefore valuable are the earnings of American sports teams. \nThe backers of the Super League say that the existing Champions League was a poor product - too many meaningless one sided games between minnows and giants of European football before it got interesting.\nThey also argue that a more stable financial top to the football pyramid is needed to ensure the cascade or trickle down to the smaller clubs that they promise will increase as a result of this.\nBut many sports fans would argue the prospect of a romantic giant killing in Real Madrid's Bernabeau stadium or Old Trafford is an essential part of the game - while regular meetings between the great clubs normalise and make humdrum what was once an exotic and rare event.\nThe backers have told the BBC this is not another extreme form of negotiation to make Uefa cave to the big clubs' long-standing demands for more control of the world's most prestigious club event - \"this is really happening, it's on, even if Uefa backs down\".\nIf it does it will have far reaching implications for the existing leagues around Europe. \nFinishing in the top four of the Premier League is the biggest prize in English football. The six teams joining the Super League have realised that six doesn't go into four - two miss out every year.\nNot any more. An insider at the Super League admitted that the plan will seriously dilute the value of the Premier League as a product - the race which is one of its key attractions will be meaningless.\nWe have been down this road before and the former Premier League chief executive suggested that the pandemic had provided a window of opportunity for a very radical proposal that would not have a chance of succeeding in normal times.\n\"There is a cynical opportunism to this,\" he said. \"They realise that things are chaotic right now and that in many ways - anything goes.\"\nBut he added: \"Football is about two groups of people. Players and fans. You upset them at your peril.\n\"If fans decide to boycott the matches, that will be a financial disaster, and if Fifa threatens to ban participating players from representing their country in the World Cup - they won't go for it.\" \nIf you like jeopardy, the stakes don't get much higher than this."

However, the cow wheat shieldbug survives where the plant grows in sheltered grassy or wooded areas with a warm micro-climate.\nGenevieve Tompkins, a field worker from the Rare Invertebrates in the Cairngorms partnership project, found the Strathspey bug.\nShe said: \"Insects are hugely under-recorded, but give us vital clues as to the health of our habitats. \n\"It is sad that this bug has suffered from a decline in traditional woodland management. \n\"However, there is hope, with diverse woodlands once more becoming a key feature of the Cairngorms National Park.\""

      "tags": "Chad,Idriss Deby",
      "text": "Chad's President Idriss D\u00e9by has died of his injuries following clashes with rebels in the north of the country at the weekend, the army has said.\nThe announcement came a day after provisional election results projected he would win a sixth term in office.\nThe government and parliament have been dissolved. A curfew has also been imposed and the borders have been shut.\nD\u00e9by, 68, spent more than three decades in power and was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. \nAn army officer by training, he came to power in 1990 through an armed uprising. He was a long-time ally of France and other Western powers in the battle against jihadist groups in the Sahel region of Africa. \nD\u00e9by \"breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield\", an army general said on state TV on Tuesday.\nHe had gone to the front line, several hundred kilometres north of the capital, N'Djamena, at the weekend to visit troops battling rebels belonging to a group calling itself Fact (the Front for Change and Concord in Chad).\nA state funeral is due to take place on Friday.\nA military council led by D\u00e9by's son, a 37-year-old four star general, will govern for the next 18 months.\nMahamat Idriss D\u00e9by Itno will lead the council, but \"free and democratic\" elections will be held once the transition period is over, the army said in its statement.\nHe later issued a statement naming the 14 other generals who will make up the new governing body.\nA BBC Monitoring journalist tweeted a copy of the notice:\nExperts have told the BBC and other broadcasters that the move is unconstitutional, and that the speaker of parliament should take over when a sitting president dies before organising elections.\nAhead of the election on 11 April, D\u00e9by campaigned on a platform of bringing peace and security to the region. Provisional results showed he had 80% of the vote.\nBut there had been growing unhappiness over his government's management of Chad's oil resources. \nIdriss D\u00e9by was known as that rare thing - a true warrior president. The former rebel and trained pilot was the opposite of an armchair general.\nFor 30 years, he clung to power in Chad - a vast nation that straddles the Sahara and is surrounded by some of the continent's most protracted conflicts.\nAnd D\u00e9by had a hand in every one of them - from Darfur to Libya, Mali, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. His troops were among the most battle-hardened on the planet.\nDomestically, he had become an increasingly autocratic figure. His latest election victory saw him claim nearly 80% of the vote.\nIt is unclear if the poor, feuding, brittle state he leaves behind can manage a smooth transition.\nAnd there are wider concerns too. For years, President D\u00e9by was the West's indispensable ally in the war against Islamist militants - in Mali, Niger and beyond.\nHis death leaves a vacuum that many may now fight to fill.\nIn a statement, the French presidency described Mr D\u00e9by as a \"brave friend\" and said it affirmed its attachment to the stability of Chad. Over the years, France has deployed troops and fighter jets to push back Mr D\u00e9by's opponents.\nChadian forces are considered to be the most effective of the Western-backed \"G5\" countries fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel region. \nAnd it has often proved to be the more stable country in a region that includes Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic - where armed groups roam freely and trade in weapons and lucrative resources that fuel conflict, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga.\nFounded in 2016 by disillusioned former army officers, the rebel Fact group accuses President D\u00e9by of repression in the run-up to the election.\nThey built up their base in Libya in the Tibesti mountains, which straddle northern Chad and part of southern Libya.\nOn election day, the group mounted an attack on a border post and gradually advanced on N'Djamena. \nThe latest clashes began on Saturday. The army says that 300 insurgents were killed and 150 captured. Five government soldiers were killed and 36 injured, it says. The figures could not immediately be verified. \nSome foreign embassies in the capital have urged their staff to leave.\nA former BBC journalist in N'Djamena says the situation there seemed relatively calm:\n\"The news is filtering through to people, but the city is calm and people are just shocked to hear that actually, because many people didn't even know that he [President D\u00e9by] was wounded or that he was at the frontline,\" said Mahamat Adamou.\n\"In the street in downtown, there are armoured vehicles that are posted at key road junctions. Of course, there is a sense of 'What is going to happen?'. But not more than that.\"\nN'Djamena has come under rebel attack before and there was panic in the city on Monday, with parents taking their children home from school, when tanks were deployed along the main roads.\n1) It is named after Lake Chad. This is the second-largest lake in Africa, but has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s. Its basin covers parts of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and is a water source for between 20 million and 30 million people.\n2) The Sahara Desert roughly covers one third of the country. Much of the north is desert and home to a mere 1% of Chad's population. The south has large expanses of wooded savannahs and woodlands.\n3) Remains of a seven-million-year-old human-like creature - or hominid - known as \"Toumai\" were unearthed in 2001. Its discoverers argued that Toumai was the oldest hominid known to science.\n4) Chad became an oil-producing nation in 2003, with the completion of a $4bn (\u00a32.87bn) pipeline linking its oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast. The industry has been plagued by allegations of corruption.\n5) Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for most people - cotton is grown in the south, and exported to Europe and the US. "

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) is predicting a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic.\nTotal energy emissions for 2021 will still be slightly lower than in 2019, the agency says.\nBut CO2 will rise by the second largest annual amount on record. \nThe use of coal in Asia is expected to be key: the IEA says it will push global demand up by 4.5%, taking it close to the global peak seen in 2014. \nHowever, renewable energy is also booming, with green sources set to supply 30% of electricity this year.\nThe empty roads, high streets and airports that marked the global response to coronavirus saw the biggest fall in demand for energy since World War Two. \nThat decline saw carbon emissions tumble by around 6% in 2020, as the more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal and oil were hardest hit by restrictions. \nMany hoped that these changes in energy use would be sustained in the recovery from the pandemic, but these latest predictions from the IEA indicate that is not likely to be the case. \nEnergy demand is booming in the developing world, with a rise of 3.4% predicted for this year - this contrasts with richer economies, where overall energy use is expected to still be 3% below 2019. \nIn the places where energy demand is growing, coal is playing a key role. \nOverall global use declined by around 4% in 2020, but is expected to rise by 4.5% this year.\nThis is mainly happening in Asia, where China is leading the way and expected to account for more than half of the global coal growth this year.\nBut even in the US and EU, where coal has been on the back foot for some time, demand is expected to rise - although it will still likely remain below 2019 levels in these regions.\nAccording to the IEA, coal demand is likely to be close to the global peak seen in 2014 - and that has implications for efforts to rein in climate change. \n\"Global carbon emissions are set to jump by 1.5 billion tonnes this year - driven by the resurgence of coal use in the power sector,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director.\n\"This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate.\"\nThe emissions predictions for 2021 would be even worse, according to the IEA, if demand for oil increased to pre-covid levels. \nBy the end of this year, oil use for aviation is still expected to be 20% below 2019 levels.\nHowever there are some strong positives for renewable energy in the IEA report. Wind, solar and other sustainable forms grew 3% during 2020, and in the power sector they are expected to grow by 8% this year. \nOverall green energy sources will provide 30% of electricity generation, the highest level since the beginning of the industrial revolution.\nReflecting the complexities of the global energy picture, China is likely to account for almost half the global increase in renewable electricity this year. \n\"As we have seen at the country-level in the past 15 years, the countries that succeed to cut their emissions are those where renewable energy replaces fossil energy,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, who has studied the factors that drive countries to change their power systems. \n\"What seems to be happening now is that we have a massive deployment of renewable energy, which is good for tackling climate change, but this is occurring alongside massive investments in coal and gas.\"\n\"Stimulus spending post-Covid-19 worldwide is still largely funding activities that lock us into high CO2 emissions for decades.\"\nLater this week, President Biden will host a climate summit, with around 40 presidents and prime ministers expected to take part virtually. \nThe US is also expected to announce a significantly improved emissions cutting target for 2030.\nAccording to the IEA, these actions can't come quickly enough if emissions are to be reined in to keep the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement within sight. \n\"Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022,\" said Dr Birol from the IEA.\n\"The leaders' summit on climate hosted by US President Joe Biden this week is a critical moment to commit to clear and immediate action ahead of COP26 in Glasgow.\" \nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "Apple is to allow the controversial social media app Parler, a popular platform with far-right supporters, back onto its App Store. \nThe app was pulled following the deadly US Capitol riots on 6 January.\nIn a letter to two Republican lawmakers on Monday, Apple said Parler had made updates to its app and content moderation policy that would lead to it being reinstated. \nIt is not yet clear when Parler will return to the App Store. \nThe platform is favoured in the US by right-wing conservatives and supporters of former President Donald Trump. \nThe app itself is very similar to Twitter in design, however it brands itself as a \"free speech\" alternative. \nIt has previously faced a barrage of criticism for hosting hate speech and fake news.\nIn the letter, Apple's director of government affairs, Timothy Powderly, said Parler had violated its guidelines - including hosting posts that \"encouraged violence, denigrated various ethnic groups, races and religions\". \nHe also said posts on the app had \"glorified Nazism\". \nHowever, since Apple took the decision to remove Parler from its App Store, Mr Powderly says Parler has worked to comply with its rules.\nThe letter, which was first reported by CNN, was addressed to two Republican lawmakers, Senator Mike Lee and Representative Ken Buck.\nIt is not yet clear what Parler has agreed to, or how the platform will be moderated in the future. \nParler was banned from both Google and Apple's app stores after extreme and far-right groups broke into the US Capitol building in Washington DC earlier this year.\nAmazon also pulled its web-hosting service days after the riots for similar reasons. In February, the platform managed to get back online, however it has not been downloadable as an app. \nParler's chief executive Mark Meckler had previously said the decision by Big Tech to cut ties with Parler had been taken \"by those who desire to silence tens of millions of Americans\".\nJames Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "Tensions are high in Minnesota this week as the jury in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin prepares to deliver its verdict.\nMr Chauvin faces two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May in Minneapolis.\nProtesters crowded the streets in Mr Floyd's name in cities across the US and around the world over the summer.\nThe trial is being viewed as a referendum on policing in the US.\nAn African-American political hopeful, a Minnesota resident and a retired police veteran shared their thoughts with the BBC when the trial began in late March.\nWe reached out to them again and they told us what stood out to them over the past three weeks.\nA community activist, an entrepreneur and a father of two, Curtis went viral last year for his impassioned message about the generational injustices African Americans have suffered. He is now running for city council in his hometown of Charlotte.\nWhat did you make of the cases presented by each side?\nThe state brought a very solid case, with very credible witnesses. I do believe the defence \"won\" a couple of days, but the prosecution held steady and remained strong throughout the whole case.\nAt the end, the defence tried to throw a wrench in there with the opinion that carbon monoxide may have been a factor in Floyd's death. I feel like they were scrambling to convince the jury or give them some sense of doubt. Their case was basically speculation and opinion of what they think might have happened, and they never had hardcore facts.\nWhat moments stood out to you the most?\nWhen it comes to an officer of the law, one would think that the police protect police and any investigations they conduct are basically of themselves. Every moment when an officer of the law got up there and testified against Chauvin - that was a moment of great bravery, for themselves and for the departments that they serve.\nPeople wanted to see if the police chief and all these other officers were going to hold this man accountable for what he did, and I believe that all of those moments were very significant. Police in uniform said that the force was unnecessary and that's what Chauvin was on trial for: he killed this man for no reason. \nWhat do you think the outcome of this trial will be?\nThe evidence is there. The facts are there. The testimonies are there. Everything is there and we need to come out with a conviction for sure. I hope the jury is going to come back with the fastest verdict in history and find him guilty of the highest charges.\nHopefully this is a teaching moment for police in America. It is time to protect and serve. Hopefully they start putting police in neighbourhoods that can actually police those neighbourhoods. A problem we are facing is that we are hiring police who have not had any interaction with individuals who live in these neighbourhoods and they don't know how to react or de-escalate or don't want to handle situations appropriately.\nMelissa is a mixed-race resident of the Minneapolis-St Paul area and a mother of two. With the trial unfolding in her backyard, she is keeping a close eye on it and hopes to see some accountability\nWhat did you make of the cases presented by each side?\nI think the state laid out a good case. They brought witnesses with details, and a lot of experts. They did a good job. And they faced a competent defence. This has been a fair trial, which is important, whether I agree with the defence or not.\nThe defence tried to argue that their police officers became distracted by the bystanders, who they tried to portray as a threatening crowd. I imagined myself there and I didn't think they looked threatening. They looked extremely concerned, extremely upset and were pleading.\nWhat moments stood out to you the most?\nListening to the testimony of the bystanders, understanding how desperate they were and \"calling the police on the police\" was very moving testimony for me.\nI keep thinking about the fire department EMT [paramedic] - the woman who wanted them to check for a pulse. She was desperate to provide medical care. It was painful to watch her testimony, but I have to say all of the witnesses are sticking in my memory.\nIt's heart-breaking. The whole thing was heart-breaking last year. The testimony of the witnesses was very upsetting. The whole thing didn't have to happen. You feel a sense of hopelessness and helplessness because it's an overwhelming problem.\nWhat do you think the outcome of this trial will be?\nI think Derek Chauvin should be found guilty. He's got three different charges against him and I don't know the nuances of these different charges, but it's up to the jury to find the perfect charge to find him guilty.\nI still believe that if George Floyd had not encountered the police that day, he would still be alive, despite all his health issues and other stuff mentioned. I haven't talked to anybody who doesn't think the police were responsible for his death. There will be an outpouring of emotion in this community.\nA retired police lieutenant who spent 34 years on the force in two states, Randy trained law enforcement for over three decades and founded The Wounded Blue, a national organisation that assists injured and disabled officers.\nWhat did you make of the cases presented by each side?\nThe cases presented the arguments as expected.\nIt's pretty frustrating to be a police officer or a police veteran these days. It is guilt presumed before innocence, which is backwards to how the United States was established to be in its delivery of justice.\nRecruitment of officers is down, and is in crisis. Who would want to be a police officer under these conditions? Not many.\nWhat moments stood out to you the most?\nThe testimony that George Floyd had no carotid artery damage was very compelling to me. This would indicate that he was not suffocated via the neck.\nAnd the evidence of the fentanyl in the back seat of the car was also an indicator that he was in fact on fentanyl as the autopsy showed. Fentanyl causes severe breathing difficulties.\nWhat do you think the outcome of this trial will be?\nIt's difficult to predict, given the political correctness and extraordinary amount of pressure this jury is under. \nThe unfortunate reality I think the country is facing is that anything short of first degree murder will bring riots.\n[Note: Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder, not first.]"

      "text": "A US police officer who died after January's Capitol riot had two strokes and died from natural causes, the chief medical examiner for Washington DC has ruled.\nTwo men are accused of using a type of pepper spray on Officer Brian Sicknick.\nHowever, the ruling means they are now unlikely to be charged with homicide.\nThe autopsy found no evidence of an allergic reaction to chemicals, nor of internal or external injuries, Dr Francisco Diaz said.\nOfficer Sicknick, 42, was defending the Capitol building from supporters of then President Donald Trump who stormed it on 6 January. He collapsed after returning to his office during the siege, and died the next day in hospital.\nIn his ruling, Dr Diaz found Officer Sicknick died of a medical condition which was not brought on by an injury. \nDue to privacy laws, Dr Diaz is unable to say whether the officer had any pre-existing medical conditions. However, he did acknowledge the policeman's role in the events, telling the Washington Post: \"All that transpired played a role in his condition.\"\nSpeculation over Officer Sicknick's death was the source of widespread misinformation after the New York Times reported erroneously that protesters had bludgeoned him with a fire extinguisher - a claim the newspaper later retracted.\nFour other people died in the Capitol riot - all pro-Trump protesters: unarmed Ashli Babbitt was shot at point blank range by a Capitol Police officer; two others died of heart failure and one from an amphetamine overdose.\nJulian Elie Khater, 32, and George Pierre Tanios, 39, were arrested in March accused of assaulting Officer Sicknick with a chemical spray. The pair, who reportedly grew up together in New Jersey, were \"working in concert and had a plan to use the toxic spray against law enforcement\", according to court documents. \nThe documents allege that Mr Khater was recorded on video asking Mr Tanios for the spray - known as bear spray - near the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, where Officer Sicknick and other police were standing guard.\nMinutes later, Mr Khater is seen on video discharging a canister of the spray into the faces of three officers, who were were temporarily blinded and incapacitated for more than 20 minutes, according to investigators.\nThe men have been charged with nine counts and face up to 20 years in prison. Their lawyers had no comment on the chief medical examiner's ruling, AP reports.\nMore than 540 suspects have been identified, and investigators have charged some 400 people in connection with the Capitol siege so far, which led to Mr Trump's second impeachment.\nExactly 100 days after the riot, prosecutors got their first guilty plea, as Jon Schaffer, 53, a member of the Oath Keepers militia group and a heavy metal guitarist admitted to two charges - obstructing an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a dangerous weapon."

      "title": "Super League: Why have the plans collapsed?",
      "text": "Plans for a new football European Super League (ESL) have collapsed, following the withdrawal of most of the teams involved. \nThe decision follows a massive backlash against the league, which had the support of some of the world's biggest clubs. \nSix English Premier League teams had signed up to the ESL - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. \nThey joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid as founder members.\nThe idea was for the clubs to remain in their national leagues, but also to play each other in a new midweek European competition, which would have rivalled the Champions League. \nThe ESL would have had 20 teams, of which 15 founding members would be permanent and never face relegation. Five other sides would qualify each year. \nAll six English Premier League clubs dropped out of the project on Tuesday night.\nThey have now been followed by Atletico Madrid in Spain and Italian team Inter Milan.\nOne of the chief movers behind the ESL, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, has now admitted that the ESL is not likely to go ahead. \n\"I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,\" he said. \"But evidently no, I don't think that project is now still up and running.\"\nWith 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics said it would have devalued the game because it was unfair and uncompetitive.\nFor instance, Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League since the 2016-17 season, but they would have been guaranteed a place - regardless of how they performed in the domestic league.\nHowever, a future winner of the Premier League would not necessarily have qualified for the ESL if they were not a permanent member.\nIf this were the case, that team would miss out on millions of pounds in revenue.\nThe ESL attracted widespread criticism from pundits, players, MPs and most football bodies not involved. \nFans of the clubs involved held several protests outside their grounds. \nIt appears they were taken aback by the strength of criticism. \nArsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had \"made a mistake\", adding they were withdrawing after listening to supporters and the \"wider football community\".\nTottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the \"anxiety and upset\" caused by the proposal.\nManchester United said they had \"listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders,\" in making their decision.\nReal Madrid president Florentino Perez had claimed it would \"save football\", at a time when young people are \"no longer interested\" because of \"a lot of poor quality games\".\nThe founding clubs were promised a share of a \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a33bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan.\nMost are in considerable debt, made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators.\nBig clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries.\nIf they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses. \nThe 20-team league would have been split into two groups of 10, playing each other at home and away.\nThe top three in each group would have qualified for the quarter-finals, with the fourth and fifth-placed teams competing in a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots.\nIt would then have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May.\nThe president of Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations), Aleksander Ceferin, had warned that participating clubs could be banned from European competition, and their players prevented from appearing at the Euros and the World Cup.\nMr Ceferin welcomed the English clubs' reversal, saying, \"the important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this, and move forward together\".\nAfter the collapse of plans for a super league, the BBC discusses the future of football with current and former club bosses, fans and sport business experts in a special Wake Up To Money Business of Sport Podcast.

      "title": "Derek Chauvin trial: What we learnt and key questions answered",
      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former US police officer accused of killing George Floyd last year, will soon come to a close. \nThe case has attracted huge global attention and after three weeks of witness and expert testimony, the jury will meet to decide the outcome on Monday. \nHere we explain what's happened so far, and BBC correspondent Tara McKelvey - who has been in Minneapolis throughout the trial - answers questions from BBC audiences about the case that led to protests around the world. \nA reminder of the background to the case; white police officer Derek Chauvin, now 45, is on trial in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd in May last year. \nDuring Mr Floyd's arrest on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 note at a food store, Mr Chauvin knelt on his neck in the street for more than nine minutes. After repeating \"I can't breathe\" more than 20 times, Mr Floyd, who was 46, died.\nVideo recorded by eyewitnesses sparked global protests over racial injustice and violent policing.\nMr Chauvin was later charged with third-degree murder, second-degree murder and manslaughter. \nA jury of 12 people, who have been hearing arguments since 29 March, must decide if Mr Chauvin will face time in jail or be acquitted.\nProsecution lawyers have claimed that Mr Chauvin used excessive and deadly force without justification. They say that Mr Floyd died from being subdued and not from drug use or ill health, as the defence has argued. \nThe top homicide investigator in Minneapolis testified that Mr Chauvin used \"totally unnecessary\" force.\nThe defence argued that Mr Chauvin's use of force against Mr Floyd was justified because he faced an \"imminent threat\" from the suspect.\nExperts called by Mr Chauvin's legal team said the former officer's behaviour did not deviate from Minneapolis police department policy and law enforcement standards.\nOn Thursday, Mr Chauvin declined to give testimony, citing his constitutional right to remain silent.\nReaders have asked about what Mr Chauvin is charged with and what the prosecution have to prove in each case. \nBBC correspondent Tara McKelvey explains the three charges of manslaughter, second-degree murder and third-degree murder. \nManslaughter is when someone unintentionally causes another person's death. \nIn second-degree murder, the act that led to someone's death could have been intentional or unintentional. The maximum sentence is 40 years in prison.\nThird-degree murder means an individual has acted in a way that endangered one or more people, ending in death. This charge was added later and experts say it is easier to prove in court, but the jail sentence would be lower.\nPolice officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial is being widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future.\nYes, from Monday, explains Tara McKelvey. Being sequestered means they will be isolated from contact with the outside world, including TV and other media. \nThe jurors will arrive at the courthouse on Monday morning, with suitcases packed. \nThe lawyers from the defence team and the prosecution will make their closing arguments, summarising key points of their case, and then the judge will explain to the jury important legal aspects they should consider. \nThen, the jurors will be taken to a hotel, where they will remain during their deliberations.\nA lawyer arguing for Mr Chauvin asked the judge to sequester the jury earlier in the trial following the high-profile shooting by a police officer in Minneapolis of 20-year-old black man Daunte Wright. The judge denied the request.\nSeveral readers asked if the charges would be dropped if the 12 jury members fail to reach a unanimous decision.\nAll the jurors have to agree in order to reach a verdict, explains Tara McKelvey. If they do not, there will be a \"hung jury\", which means the jurors were unable to reach a conclusion. \nAt that point, the judge could declare a mistrial. A second trial would then have to take place, and the process would start again.\nThe other former officers, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J Alexander Kueng, who were with Mr Chauvin during Mr Floyd's arrest, have been charged with aiding and abetting. \nThey are due to face trial in August.\nSeveral readers asked questions about the debate over whether the field of forensic science has a racial bias. It comes after the Journal of Forensic Sciences published a study which showed that medically irrelevant information like the victim's race can sway the decisions of forensic pathologists.\nDuring the trial, medical experts testified about Mr Floyd's cause of death, including forensic pathologist David Fowler, who was a witness for the defence.\nMr Fowler was formerly a chief medical examiner in the US state of Maryland. He has also taught classes at the University of Maryland School of Medicine as an adjunct associate professor. \nHis work for the state of Maryland was controversial, and the American Civil Liberties Union has criticised his tenure, stating that his office was \"complicit in creating false narratives about what kills black people in police encounters\"."

We'd gone down there about half an hour after it happened. t's a good 40m wide, but it's hard to tell.\"\nJoan Coppin, who lives near the beach, said: \"It's taken land from the bottom of holiday homes on Rhodfar Mor - we have got local people to the right of those and they are in quite a precarious place, I would say.\n\"Us locals don't go there when the tide is coming in. The whole of the area - about two-and-a-half miles - has coastal erosion.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nSix people from any households will be able to meet outdoors in Wales from Saturday, and in beer gardens once pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen next Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford says the lower risk of catching Covid outdoors allows for the further easing of restrictions. However, Conservatives accused his Labour administration of \"playing politics\", given it's the second time lockdown plans have changed during the Senedd election campaign.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm the most significant stage in lockdown easing later. The reopening of hospitality, gyms and non-essential shops is scheduled from Monday, while travel between Scotland, England and Wales could also be allowed for the first time this year. The government's \"route map\" also allows for up to six people from two households to socialise indoors in a public place and the conditional reopening of hospitality venues.\nThe UK unemployment rate fell to 4.9% in the three months to February, according to official figures. The fall - down from 5% in the three months to January - came despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown restrictions for at least some of the period. The Office for National Statistics says the jobs market is \"broadly stable\" but \"remains subdued\", with five million people still furloughed and more than 800,000 fewer employees than before the pandemic.\nPolice officers have sometimes struggled to enforce coronavirus restrictions because of a lack of clarity from ministers, according to analysis by a policing watchdog. Chief constables heard about new restrictions from the government's television briefings, the report says. Confusion led to mistakes, putting confidence at risk, but forces in England and Wales learned from mistakes, the report by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) says.\nThere can't be many positive by-products of a global pandemic but UK consumers can, perhaps, enjoy cheaper car insurance. The average cost has fallen by \u00a387 in 12 months due to lower risk of accidents, according to price comparison website Confused.com.

      "tags": "Minnesota,Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has said he is praying for the \"right verdict\" in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis ex-policeman accused of killing George Floyd last year.\nMr Biden, who spoke to Mr Floyd's family on Monday, implied he felt the evidence was \"overwhelming\".\nHis comments came as the jury meets for a second day to consider its verdict.\nMr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May.\nHe is on trial for charges including second-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism. Cities around the US are bracing for renewed protests regardless of the verdict.\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president spoke to Mr Floyd's family on Monday to \"check in with them and also share that the family was in his prayers\".\n\"The jury is sequestered... he certainly is not looking to influence [the trial],\" she added.\nMr Biden spoke in more detail about the call at the White House on Tuesday. \"I can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they are feeling,\" he said of the family.\n\"I waited until the jury was sequestered and I called [them],\" he said. \"They're calling for peace... no matter what that verdict is.\"\n\"I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict,\" Mr Biden added. \"I think it's overwhelming in my view.\"\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mr Floyd's younger brother confirmed that he had spoken to the president.\n\"[Mr Biden] knows how it is to lose a family member, and he knows the process of what we're going through,\" Philonise Floyd told NBC News. \"He was just letting us know that he was praying for us.\"\nMr Biden lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident in 1972. In 2015, his son Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46.\nThis afternoon I asked Press Secretary Jen Psaki what Biden saw as his responsibility, as president, at the conclusion of the trial. \nShe said this is an \"extremely painful moment\" for people \"who are tired of seeing one person after another lose their life at the hands of law enforcement\". \n\"He's aware of that,\" she added, \"and the need for reform.\" \nThat may be the case, but Biden just positioned himself into the middle of a social and political tinder-box just a day after the presiding judge in the trial warned politicians to \"stop talking about the case\" and that their failure to do so was \"abhorrent\".\nThat tinder-box could explode depending on the outcome of the trial, and Biden will be judged on how he handles the resulting fallout. \nBy effectively taking sides, his ability to serve as a leader for this divided nation may prove all the more challenging.\nThe jury has retired to consider testimony from 45 witnesses, including doctors, use-of-force experts, police officers, bystanders and people who were close to Mr Floyd.\nMr Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge - second-degree murder.\nA conviction on any of the counts against him will require the jury to return a unanimous verdict. A single juror holding out would result in a mistrial, but the state could then try Mr Chauvin again.\nOf the 12 jurors, six are white, four are black and two are multiracial. Seven are women and five are men.\nOn Monday, the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, requested security assistance from the states of Ohio and Nebraska ahead of the verdict.\nThe prosecution and defence made their closing statements on Monday following a trial that lasted three weeks\nMr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson argued that his client did what any \"reasonable police officer\" would have done after finding himself in a \"dynamic\" and \"fluid\" situation involving a large man scuffling with three officers.\nThe defence has sought to show that drugs may have caused Mr Floyd's death.\nMr Nelson argued that Mr Floyd's drug use was \"significant\" because the body reacts to opioid use, specifically in the case of someone who had been diagnosed with hypertension and high blood pressure.\nThe lawyer also argued that his client was unlikely to have intentionally violated use-of-force rules as he would have been aware that the whole interaction was being recorded.\nProsecutors have tried to prove Mr Chauvin's use of force resulted in Mr Floyd's death.\nProsecutor Steve Schleicher urged jurors to \"use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,\" referring to the video showing Mr Chauvin kneeling on Mr Floyd.\n\"This wasn't policing; this was murder,\" he added.\nProsecutor Jerry Blackwell had the final word on Monday. He said the matter was \"so simple that a child can understand it\".\n\"In fact, a child did understand it, when the nine-year-old girl said, 'Get off of him,'\" Mr Blackwell said, referring to a young onlooker who objected. \"That's how simple it was. 'Get off of him.' Common sense.\""

      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed the most significant stage in Scotland's lockdown easing will go ahead as planned on Monday.\nThe biggest changes since the country went into lockdown on Boxing Day will include the reopening of hospitality, gyms and non-essential shops.\nNon-essential travel with England, Wales and Northern Ireland will also be allowed for the first time this year.\nMainland Scotland will move down from level four to three restrictions.\nMs Sturgeon said that if the data continued to improve, the whole of Scotland would move to level two on 17 May. \nThis would allow people to meet indoors in small numbers and see a further easing of hospitality restrictions.\nThe first minister said she hoped that the country would move to level one on 7 June, and then to level zero later that month.\nShe said life should look \"much more like normality\" during July.\n\"We are hopeful, very hopeful, of seeing sustained progress in the weeks and months ahead,\" she said.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that travel restrictions between parts of Scotland and other parts of the UK could be introduced to deal with local outbreaks.\nShe also announced that from Monday lateral flow tests would be available to anyone in the country. The kits can be ordered online or picked up at testing centres in the afternoon and early evening.\nMs Sturgeon encouraged everyone to take advantage of the offer, especially those planning to visit Scotland's islands.\nWhen Scotland moves down to level three restrictions on Monday, it will be possible for: \nFrom this date, takeaways can be collected indoors, non-essential childcare will be allowed, non-essential work can be carried out inside houses and driving lessons and tests can take place again.\nThe first minister said people would be looking forward to doing things they have been unable to do for some time.\nBut she added: \"We must remember that the virus we are dealing with now is much more infectious than it was when bars and cafes were last open so it is really important that as we enjoy these new restored freedoms we continue to be really careful and take all of the required precautions.\"\nHowever, many in the hospitality sector are unhappy with draft guidance.\nThey expected 1m (3ft) social distancing to be in place between tables, but the proposals want people from different households to observe social distancing at tables.\nBut during the briefing Ms Sturgeon said this guidance had not changed since last year.\nThe easing of restrictions on 17 May should enable pubs to open indoors until 22:30 and allow contact sports and some small-scale events to take place.\nFrom that date, up to four people from two households will also be able to meet indoors.\nOther changes could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with indoor group exercise.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said all the public health evidence suggests the country is getting on top of the virus but the government should \"safely and cautiously look to ease these restrictions a little bit quicker.\"\nMr Ross added he would like gyms to open before Monday and he would also have liked more freedom for hospitality from 26 April.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it was right the government took a careful, phased approach to easing restrictions, backed up by data.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"The last thing we need is another lockdown. We have to make sure this is the last one.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton welcomed the developments but called for the country's test and trace system to be \"beefed up\".\nHe added: \"If new strains arrive in the Scotland we must have the resources in place to swiftly crush them before they can spread.\"\nAnd Scottish Greens co-convenor Alison Johnstone said ministers should avoid the temptation to act with haste and continue to listen to the best scientific advice.\nShe also called for the government to be more proactive in terms of quarantine and said people should stay in Scotland for their holidays.\nDr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, called for additional support and compensation for businesses which have not yet been allowed to reopen.\nShe added: \"To translate hope into reality, the business community needs the Scottish government to empower businesses to re-open with sensible guidelines that enable us to get back on our feet.\"\nDavid Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, estimates non-essential stores lost out on \u00a34bn of sales during the first 12 months of the pandemic.\nHe said: \"Re-opening alone isn't a silver bullet which will save Scotland's shops. \n\"While we do expect a level of pent-up demand to return, shopper footfall is likely to be constrained for some weeks yet by the later re-opening of much of hospitality, tourism, and offices in our city centres.\" "

      "tags": "Oliver Dowden",
      "text": "The government has said it will do \"whatever it takes\" to prevent a breakaway European Super League involving six leading English clubs. \nBoris Johnson said ministers would be working to make sure the league did not go ahead in the way being proposed.\nThe Duke of Cambridge also said he shared fans' concerns about \"the damage it risks causing to the game we love\".\nBut the president of Real Madrid told a Spanish TV show: \"We are doing this to save football at this critical moment.\"\nFlorentino Perez, president of Real Madrid, said the decision to create the new league was in part taken because \"young people are no longer interested\" in the game.\nSpeaking for the first time since the league was announced, Mr Perez said: \"Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt.\"\nThe 12 founding members of the league, which includes Real Madrid plus three yet to join - would be permanent and never face relegation.\nSix English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league\nThey would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan.\nThe competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition.\nMatches would take place midweek and rival the existing Champions League.\nBut the president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, warned players who play for teams in the ESL would be \"banned from the World Cup and the Euros\".\nAs opposition to the plans gathered momentum, Prince William, President of the Football Association, said in a tweet: \"Now, more than ever, we must protect the entire football community - from the top level to the grassroots - and the values of competition and fairness at its core.\"\nAnd broadcaster Sky Sports said: \"We have not been involved in any discussions with the proposed breakaway European Super League.\"\n\"We are completely focused on supporting our long term football partners in the UK and in Europe, already providing fans with the best live action from the best football competitions in the world,\" the company added.\nIn a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden criticised the so-called \"big six\" English clubs for going \"against the very spirit of the game\".\nHe added club owners \"should remember that they are only temporary custodians of these clubs and that they forget fans at their peril\".\nMr Dowden said he had spoken to Uefa and the Football Association, who both oppose the move by the 12 clubs, adding that, \"if they can't act, we will\".\n\"We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening,\" he told MPs. \n\"We are examining every option from governance reform to competition law and mechanisms that allow football to take place.\n\"We will be reviewing everything Government does to support these clubs to play. We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game.\"\nA fan-led review, due to take place after the pandemic, has been brought forward because of the ESL announcement, Mr Dowden said. \nIt will be led by former sports minister Tracey Crouch and consider how fans can have an even greater say in the oversight of the game.\nThe review will also look at the finances of the men's and women's game, its governance and whether an independent football regulator should be set up.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was \"going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this (plan) doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed\".\nDowning Street said ministers were looking at a \"range of options\", including a German-style system of fan ownership of clubs and clawing back coronavirus support loans.\nBut Labour urged ministers to do more, with shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens saying it was \"time for the government to get off the subs bench and show some leadership on the pitch because we need reform of football\".\nShe added: \"It's not as if there's been a blockage here in Parliament preventing the government from taking action to sort the problems out.\"\nFans and pundits have expressed revulsion at what they claim would be an unfair competition that would lock many teams out of top European football.\nMatch of the Day host and former England footballer Gary Lineker said it was \"a time of great concern\", adding that if the ESL went ahead as planned, it would have \"massive ramifications\" on the domestic game.\n\"It will wreck the pyramid system (of leagues, promotion and relegation) that has been so important to local football clubs, communities and teams, and it takes out the competition.\" \nAround 68% of football fans strongly oppose the creation of the ESL, while only 14% support it, according to a YouGov survey of 1,730 fans. \nSome 700 football supporters gathered outside Leeds United's Elland Road ground ahead of the club's Premier League game against Liverpool to protest against the proposed new league. \n A Liverpool shirt was burned and a plane flew over the stadium displaying an anti-Super League message.\nInside the stadium Leeds players wore T-shirts saying 'Earn it' next to the Champions League logo and 'Football is for the fans'. A banner behind one goal had the same message.\nLaunching their plan, the 12 founding members of the ESL said the pandemic had \"accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model\".\nThey said there was a \"need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid\".\nBBC's Sports Editor Dan Roan said leading figures were insisting the Super League would generate much more money, not just for the clubs involved, but for the rest of the \"football family\". \nHe added they seemed \"very confident\" they were on a strong legal footing when it came to blocking any punishments threatened by bodies such as Uefa.\nEarlier, Manchester United's shares rose within minutes of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where they are traded.\nFifteen minutes after the trading day began, they were up around 8.5%. \nMeanwhile, Juventus's share price jumped by more than 14% on Monday morning.\nBut Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said he remained opposed to the idea of the league - despite his club agreeing to join it. \n\"I like the competitive aspect of football. I like that West Ham might play in the Champions League,\" he said, adding that he and his players did not know about the move before it happened. "

      "text": "A bomb left near a police officer's car outside her home in County Londonderry was an attempt to kill her and her young daughter, police have said.\nThe explosive was attached to a container of flammable liquid next to her car in Dungiven on Monday.\n\"This was designed to cause a fireball which would have engulfed the victim's car and anyone in it or close by,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan.\nPolice believe the dissident republican group the New IRA was responsible.\n\"What is really distressing here is the terrorists placed the bomb at the rear of the car directly at the point where the victim's three-year-old daughter sits,\" said ACC McEwan of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\n\"This demonstrates the complete and utter disregard for the life of a mother and her toddler - this simply beggars belief.\"\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have described the attempted attack as \"reprehensible\".\n\"I do give thanks that she has survived this dreadful murder attempt,\" said Mrs Foster, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader.\n\"When I spoke to this lady earlier I gave her my prayerful support and indeed solidarity at this difficult time.\"\n\"To the republicans who sought to murder this young mother, your campaign is futile, you will never succeed.\"\nACC McEwan said dissident republicans were \"still intent on recklessly targeting honest hardworking members of our community\".\n\"They have no concern at all for those that are killed or harmed in the process,\" he said.\n\"It's time for people to examine their own conscience and ask themselves whether they support groups who are attempting to kill a three-year-old child and her mother.\n\"We will be unrelenting in our efforts to bring these people to justice.\"\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne said it was an \"outrageous attack\" on the officer and her family.\nPart of Ballyquin Road, which had been closed while police examined the scene, reopened on Tuesday evening.\nThis sounds like some kind of supercharged incendiary bomb. \nIt maybe has echoes of more of the improvised devices of the Troubles than what we have come to associate with New IRA attacks of recent years. \nIn this instance, the police have not disclosed how this bomb was to have been triggered. That is not unusual. They can often hold certain information back and it remains unclear how this bomb was to have been set off. \nBut for the PSNI this is a secondary fact. They say it was designed create a huge fireball smothering those in its vicinity in flames.\nLast summer we saw the alleged leadership of the New IRA arrested following an MI5 bugging operation. Ten people were remanded in custody, accused of 50 serious offences under the Terrorism Act. \nHowever, the group has been re-organising and despite that setback has remained dangerous. The threat level has stayed at severe and in its recent Easter message the New IRA vowed to continue its campaign. \nBut until today you had to go back more than a year since the last New IRA attack on police. \nWhile the guard has not been down, the PSNI will undoubtedly be concerned the organisation has resurfaced in terms of attacks on its officers.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described the attempted attack as a \"shocking and deplorable attempt on the life of a police officer that will rightly be reviled across the community\".\n\"Those behind this reckless attack have absolutely nothing to offer society and have shown a callous disregard for the entire community,\" said the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president.\n\"They seek only to drag our communities backwards; they have no place in our society and they should disband.\"\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said it was a \"despicable and cowardly act\". \nThe Alliance Party leader added: \"When a device explodes, it does not discriminate. It does not pick and choose who it injures or who it kills. \n\"The people who sneaked around in the dark to plant this device have shown an utter disregard for human life, not only for this officer but for others living in the area or who may have been passing by.\"\nThe Police Federation for Northern Ireland said the officer's dedication \"to serving the community\" was in stark contrast \"to those who offer nothing but death and destruction\".\n\"Society has moved on and those engaged in such activity need to be consigned to the past,\" the federation added.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: \"I want to convey my support for the officer concerned.\n\"Those who try to attack public servants have nothing to offer the communities they claim to represent.\"\nUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said it was a \"cowardly attempt on the life of someone who is courageously putting her selflessness to the good of all of our community\".\nSDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said the attempted attack was disgraceful.\n\"Those responsible and their warped agenda are putting police officers and our community in danger,\" he added."

      "text": "Most curbs to people's daily lives have been lifted as Wales moves to the lowest level of Covid rules.\nRules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have been removed, while nightclubs are able to reopen for the first time since measures brought in to tackle the spread of Omicron were introduced after Christmas.\nSocial distancing rules were also scrapped as Wales moved into alert level zero on 28 January.\nPeople who test positive for Covid must now isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nHowever masks are still required to be worn in most public places in Wales, including shops, hospitals and on public transport. \nBut they are no longer needed for bars and restaurants, and changes to rules due to be announced later, mean they will also no longer be needed when visiting someone in their own room at a care home.\nWhat do the changes mean for people and businesses in Wales, and what can you do and when?\nChanges to rules have been made over the last two weeks, after First Minister Mark Drakeford laid out his plan to ease restrictions by the end of January.\nThe changes saw:\nFrom Thursday, 10 February Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero\nThe lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic, we were last in alert level zero at Christmas.\nUnder it most curbs to our daily life are removed, all businesses are allowed to reopen, but people still have to wear face masks in many public places, and self isolation rules still apply.\nSince 22 December, fully vaccinated adults, children aged between five and 18 and vaccine clinical trial participants identified as a close contact of a positive case of Covid-19 in Wales do not need to self-isolate. \nInstead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "tags": "Department for Transport,Grant Shapps,Road safety",
      "text": "No more smart motorways without hard shoulders will be able to open without additional safety measures in place, the government has said. \nIt said any new \"all lane running\" roads would need radar technology installed first to detect stopped cars.\nSmart motorways use technology and other measures to cut congestion, such as opening the hard shoulder. \nBut there are fears about their safety after fatal accidents involving stationary cars being hit from behind.\nIn a written statement to Parliament, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that for every hundred million miles driven there were fewer deaths on all-lane motorways than conventional ones.\nBut he added: \"We are determined to do all we can to help drivers feel safer and be safer on our roads - all our roads.\"\nHe said Highways England would now accelerate the introduction of a number of safety measures set out last year.  \n\"Most significantly, radar-based stopped vehicle detection technology will now be installed on all operational all lane running (ALR) motorways by September 2022, six months earlier than planned,\" he said. \n\"Highways England has also made a commitment that no ALR motorways will open without radar technology to spot stopped vehicles, enable lanes to be closed where necessary and get help to drivers quickly.\"\nOther measures include upgrading cameras so motorists ignoring closed lanes indicated by red X signs can be caught and prosecuted, and putting more signs up about distances to emergency refuge areas.\nThe RAC's head of roads policy, Nicholas Lyes, said the motoring organisation was \"concerned that drivers will still need to wait up to 18 months before all cameras are enforcing red X lane closed signs\".\nHe said: \"Enforcement is vital in getting all drivers to obey these signs as anyone who disregards them is at a much greater risk of being in collision with a stranded vehicle.\"\nSmart motorways, which use technology to maintain the flow of traffic and give information on overhead displays, have existed in England since 2002.\nThe \"all lane running\" versions - which involves opening the hard shoulder permanently to drivers - began in 2014. \nBut a coroner in Sheffield found in January that such roads \"present an ongoing risk of future deaths\" after two people were killed when a lorry ploughed into their vehicles while they were stationary on the M1 in South Yorkshire.\nClaire Mercer, whose husband Jason Mercer died in the accident in June 2019, and who now campaigns against smart motorways, said: \"It's all compromises. Nothing is new. Nothing short of giving back the hard shoulder in every single instance will be acceptable.\"\nShe said she was sitting in a coffee shop with her husband Jason just before he was killed.\n\"We were sat chatting. At 8 o'clock he got up to leave, kissed me goodbye, told me he loved me, and apparently he was dead by 8:15,\" she said.\nHer husband and another motorist, Alexandru Murgeanu, had stopped after a minor collision.\nShe said over the past few months support for her campaign had grown exponentially.\n\"I just don't understand why they [the government] are digging in against accepting public opinion... People are starting to get really angry about being ignored.\"\nIn 2019, 15 people were killed on \"all lane running\" and \"dynamic hard shoulder\" motorways. This is four more deaths than in 2018.\nThe number of people being killed on motorways without hard shoulders increased each year from 2015 to 2019, and totalled 39 deaths.\nBy contrast, on so-called \"controlled motorways\" - a type of smart motorway which have variable speed limits and a hard shoulder - there were 24 deaths in that period.\nOn conventional motorways, which cover more of the UK than smart motorways, there were 368 fatalities from 2015 to 2019.\nThe Highways England report found that crashes between moving and stationary vehicles were more likely on such motorways.\nBut collisions between two or more moving vehicles - which is how more people die - were less likely due to speed regulation.\nThe Commons' Transport Select Committee has launched an inquiry into smart motorways, with chairman and Tory MP Huw Merriman warning there are \"genuine worries\" about the roads. \nAnd the AA and RAC have raised concerns that vehicles that break down on sections of road with no hard shoulder face greater dangers than before.\nReacting to the Department for Transport's update, AA president Edmund King said: \"It is encouraging that progress has been made on our demands to make 'smart' motorways safer. The objective should be to create the safest roads we can. \n\"The number one improvement advocated by the AA and our members is to increase the number of emergency refuge areas (ERAs) and retrofit them to older schemes to ensure they are placed at approximately 0.75 miles apart. \n\"More ERAs, together with improving the accuracy of stopped vehicle detection radar, should be the urgent priorities.\"\nThere are plans for about 800 miles of smart motorway in the UK by 2025 - up from just under 500 miles currently. \nAt the moment parts of the smart motorway network are not monitored by radar technology, but by human observation from watch centres.\nIt's the nightmare scenario. Breaking down on a motorway, without a hard shoulder to take refuge on, and with cars and lorries whizzing past inches away.\nThe government says smart motorways are safer than conventional ones. And it points out that hard shoulders themselves are far from safe. People get killed waiting there, too.\nMany motorists will find all this hard to accept, especially when they see other drivers ignoring speed limits or lane closures when incidents occur.\nBut the government needs to convince them. It's cheaper to have smart motorways than bigger roads. \nThat's why it says it's going all out to improve safety on roads it claims are already very safe. It wants to reassure people.\nThe question is, will critics be persuaded?"

We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt.\"\nThe president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, has warned players who play for teams in the ESL that they would be \"banned from the World Cup and the Euros\".\nBut in a letter to Uefa and Fifa, seen by the BBC, lawyers for the ESL say they have filed injunctions to prevent player and club bans, saying they consider such actions to be \"unlawful\".\nAn insider at the ESL said they had prepared themselves for a huge backlash, and thought they were on firm legal ground with respect to competition law. \n\"I think in the cold light of day, they are looking at this and the reality is dawning that this is happening and it's perfectly legal,\" they told the BBC.\nA Spanish court has temporarily blocked any attempt by Uefa or Fifa to ban clubs or players from leagues or competitions, in an interim ruling to prevent any bans before the legal basis of this can be tested. \nESL insiders said \"this looks aggressive but we had to take defensive action in the face of threats from Uefa and Fifa - our hope is we can ultimately resolve this in negotiations\".\nThe 14 Premier League clubs not participating in the new venture \"unanimously and vigorously\" rejected the plans for the competition and are \"considering all actions available to prevent it from progressing\".\nA statement released on Tuesday said they \"call on those clubs involved in the proposed competition to cease their involvement immediately\".\nOne of these, Everton, released a statement criticising the \"preposterous arrogance\" of the clubs involved.\nDowning Street said the prime minister told his meeting with FA and Premier League officials that the government \"will not stand by while a small handful of owners create a closed shop\".\nBoris Johnson reiterated his \"unwavering support for the football authorities and confirmed they have the government's full backing to take whatever action necessary to put a stop to these plans\", a statement said.\nHe also made it clear \"that no action is off the table and the government is exploring every possibility, including legislative options, to ensure these proposals are stopped\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said among the measures under consideration were preventing players of the clubs involved getting work visas and the withdrawal of police funding for match days.\nChief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, Kevin Miles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: \"The mood music from the government was they would do what was required to make sure that the measures to exclude those [ESL] clubs from competitions would not fall foul of competition law, and that they would amend the law if necessary.\"\nUK watchdog the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be \"carefully considering any competition aspects of these proposals\".\nThe proposed league has united MPs from every party against it. Suggestions from MPs on action the government could take include governance reform, changes to competition law, changes to taxpayer support for clubs and border controls on arrivals into the UK.\nThe Arsenal Supporters' Trust said it was \"delighted\" to hear the government's promise of action, adding that the PM vowed the football governance review led by Conservative MP and former sports minister Tracey Crouch would be \"swift\".\nThere have been protests by fans across the country against the proposed league, including outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground on Tuesday. \nSix English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league.\nThey would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan.\nThe competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition.\nMatches would take place midweek in an attempt to have more matches between the big-name clubs and rival the existing Champions League.\nThe plans revealed on Sunday that the 12 founding football clubs would be permanent members and never face relegation. \nCritics say the new league could supplant the existing Champions League and disrupt the current football \"pyramid\" that sees teams rise or fall on merit.\nRead more here.\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer told BBC Breakfast the six English clubs should be expelled from the Premier League, which they have said they aim to remain in while also playing in the European Super League.\n\"It's not right what they are doing, it's not competitive, it's a closed shop - you can't have a competition where no one else is allowed in,\" he said.\n\"You can hear, feel and see the anger from almost everyone in football.\"\nChairman of the Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Julian Knight, said restricting work visas for footballers who play in the proposed ESL could be one way the government could pull levers to stop the league going ahead.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said other options were a windfall tax on clubs and long-term reform giving fans much greater power on football club boards.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he thought the \"threat of legislation will have an effect\" but the government needed to act quickly. \nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called for \"real action\" from the government, suggesting a new law requiring owners to ballot season ticket holders before committing clubs to newly formed competitions. \nAnd on Monday, the Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the Football Association, said he shared fans' concerns about \"the damage it risks causing to the game we love\".\nGianni Infantino, president of the world football's governing body Fifa, said he \"strongly disapproves\" of the plans.\n\"If some elect to go their own way, they must live with the consequences of their choice. They are responsible for their choice completely. This means you are either in or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out.\"\nSky Sports confirmed it had \"not been involved in any discussions\" about the breakaway league."

      "text": "British motorists are facing the biggest drop in car insurance costs in almost six years, a price comparison website has found.\nConfused.com says the average cost of car insurance has fallen by \u00a387 in 12 months due to lower risk of accidents. \nThis comes as average mileage dropped by 43% during the pandemic as driving habits changed.\nThe cost of insurance for men fell by \u00a391, a 14% fall year-on-year, while female drivers are saving \u00a382.  \nConfused.com's latest Car Insurance Price Index, in partnership with global insurance broker Willis Towers Watson, tracked six million insurance quotes during the first quarter of 2021.\nThe data showed motorists in the UK can now expect to pay an average of \u00a3538 on car insurance for the next year.\nYet if you've received your car insurance renewal in the last three months, you might have seen your insurance premium go up by an average of \u00a345 - an amount derived from the insurance quotes tracked. \nThe price comparison site says this shows motorists are likely to pay more if they opt to stick with their current insurer.\nConsumer group Which? says that while it is good news that prices are coming down, this doesn't necessarily mean that you are guaranteed to get a price reduction on your car insurance quote.\n\"The reduction in premiums is clearly a reflection in quite a radical change in driver behaviour, and people being on the road less as a result of the pandemic, but in order for consumers to get the best deal on their car insurance, they should spend time on price comparison sites,\" said Which?'s head of money Gareth Shaw.\nHe added that the quote an insurer gives you depends on a set of personalised circumstances, including the type of car you drive, where you live, your driving history, your no-claims bonuses, the technology that might be in your car, the age of your car, or even your relationship status.\n\"It might be an option but it really depends on where you are in your contract and whether it's cost effective to switch,\" said Mr Shaw.

      "tags": "Unemployment,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. \nIn the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. \nThe data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. \nThis was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market \"remains subdued\", with five million people employed but still on furlough. \nHead of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Suren\u202fThiru, said:\u202f \"Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. \n\"Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery.\" \nOverall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. \nBut the ONS said younger people were suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. \nPeople aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. \nGerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a \"post-pandemic low\". \n\"This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme.\"\nIt would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s.\nBut the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. \nThis provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. \nThe ONS said the overall jobs market had been \"broadly stable\" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. \nONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market \"remains subdued\" but that there were positive signs. \n\"With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality.\"\nThe Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the \"evolution of the pandemic\".\nHannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy. \n\"We expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months with the reopening of hospitality and retail, provided the government's roadmap to reopening the economy continues to go to plan.\"  "

      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

I see shops reopening and close contact services reopening in tiny shops... it's frustrating. \n\"I've been closed [for] four months now. It's annoying that Welsh government are making changes all the time.\"\nMichaela Breeze, a Commonwealth Games weightlifting champion who owns her own gym in Swansea, said the news was \"fantastic\" but she was \"pulling my hair out in despair\" because she had already spent money planning to open on the previous date.\n\"That decision has cost me several thousands of pounds,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We are trying to run businesses here - it requires time, it requires practice and it requires planning to notify members.\"\nDylan Allsopp, a personal trainer in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: \"It's great we have been given the opportunity to open early, but realistically we are still back of the queue with no data to back it up.\n\"When you look at the data and you see gyms contribute to two cases in 100,000 visits, you wonder why you aren't being allowed to open.\"\nAlthough she admitted to not being an avid user of gyms, molecular epidemiologist Dr Helen Wimalarathna said there was a risk to reopening them, but this needed to be balanced against the benefit to people's health.\n\"It's a question of ventilation and how much people exhale in a gym environment,\" she said.\n\"Getting hot and sweaty and breathing out over the equipment, then there's a high degree of sanitisation that needs to take place afterwards before it is safe for someone else to use that space.\n\"But obviously exercise is really important for people, physically and mentally, and we know that physical health and underlying factors like obesity have really contributed to the worst of this pandemic, so it is good to give people the opportunity to keep in shape.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmed that lockdown changes which had been planned for 12 April would go ahead. \nThis means, from Monday, all remaining children will return to school for face-to-face learning, non-essential shops will reopen, and close-contact services, such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen. \nNon-essential retailers have been closed since Wales went into lockdown on 20 December. \nTravel across the border between Wales and England will also be permitted from Monday. \nWales' \"stay local\" rule was removed on 27 March, allowing people to travel anywhere within its borders, but the changes will allow travel across the whole of the UK. \nThe decision follows a rapid drop in the number of new coronavirus cases in Wales. \nDates for the reopening of the hospitality industry in Wales have not changed, despite the other alterations to lockdown easing dates. \nPubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open outdoors from 26 April and indoor service could be allowed from the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. \nPubs in England can reopen outdoors from Monday. \nWales' case rate, which measures the number of infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, stands at 21, compared to 37 last week.\nConfirmed cases in hospital beds are 26% lower than last Thursday, the lowest number since 22 September.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Last week, we set out our programme to further reopen the economy and relax the restrictions we have lived with for so long, as part of our careful, step-by-step approach to keeping everyone safe. \n\"This week, because of the improvements we continue to see, we can bring forward some of our plans. This is only possible because of the efforts everyone is making to protect themselves and their loved ones.\"\nAny of the changes proposed after 6 May could depend on the outcome of the Senedd elections and which party is in power.\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"Plaid Cymru has been pressing the case for gyms to reopen as quickly and as safely as is possible because they are crucial for people's mental health and well-being. This new date, whilst welcome, is still not early enough. \n\"The scenes of unregulated drinking over recent days has been a serious cause of concern and many will question the Labour government's decision not to move the reopening of outdoor hospitality forward. A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option.\"\nAndrew RT Davies, the Senedd leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"The great British vaccination programme protects more and more lives every day and gives us the ability to restore freedoms in a safe but accelerated manner.\n\"Pressure from the public and Welsh Conservatives have forced Labour ministers to act, but there is still more they can do in accelerating the roadmap with the safe resumption of activities such as outdoor hospitality and gyms.\"\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: \"This is welcome news. Gyms and fitness centres play an important part in both the physical and mental health of so many people across Wales. Everyone who has abided by the rules has played a part in bringing this announcement forward.\n\"The public must remember however that the virus has not gone away and they need to stick to the rules including with regard to social distancing.\""

      "text": "A majority of people on both sides of the Irish border believes Northern Ireland will have left the UK within 25 years, a poll suggests.\nMost respondents said they thought NI would still be part of the UK in 10 years time, but not in 25 years.\nIn NI, 49% of people said if there was a border poll today they would vote to remain in the UK, with 43% backing a united Ireland and 8% undecided.\nThe poll was commissioned by BBC NI's Spotlight programme.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, where a vote would have to be held in parallel with any border poll in Northern Ireland, 51%  said they would vote for a United Ireland, 27% would vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK and 22% were not sure. \nWhen asked if they thought NI woud be part of the UK in 10 years, 55% in NI and 59% in the Republic of Ireland said they thought it would be.\nBut when asked if this would be the case in 25 years, 51% of people in NI and 54% in the Republic said NI would have left the UK.\nThe poll also suggested that only 40% of people in Northern Ireland saw its formation 100 years ago as a cause for celebration.\nMost people on both sides of the Irish border believed there was a potential for a return to political violence in Northern Ireland, according to the poll.\nThe poll was carried out over the Easter period when clashes were taking place in a number of areas across Northern Ireland, sparked by loyalist anger over the Northern Ireland trade protocol and the Police Service of Northern Ireland's handling of a republican funeral during the pandemic. \nOf those surveyed in Northern Ireland, 76% agreed with the proposition that \"the dispute over Northern Ireland's status remains unresolved and there is still a potential for violence in the future\".\nIn the Republic, an even higher proportion, 87%, echoed that view. \nA total of 48% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters they want the controversial trade protocol introduced as part of the UK's EU Withdrawal Agreement scrapped, in line with demands from the DUP and other unionist parties, while 46% wanted the protocol to be retained. \nUnionists have claimed the protocol, which requires checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. \nInterviewed for the Spotlight programme, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin insisted the protocol was not tearing the UK apart, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was working to \"sandpaper\" away what he described as the \"ludicrous barriers\" to trade across the Irish Sea.  \nIn the Republic, a majority of those surveyed supported the Irish government's defence of the trade protocol, with 74% saying it should not be scrapped.   \nAlthough within Northern Ireland a larger number of people rejected the trade protocol than backed it, the poll also provided an indication that a majority wants to retain some form of economic link with the EU. \nSome 56% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters that they wanted their assembly members (MLAs) to vote to stay within the EU Single Market when the matter is put to a vote at Stormont in three years' time. \nOnly 38% indicated they wanted to leave the EU Single Market. \nIn Northern Ireland 37% of people surveyed told the pollsters they would like to see a border poll within the next five years, whilst a further 29% want it to happen at some point after that. \nHowever the prime minister told the Spotlight programme that he cannot see any Northern Ireland secretary considering a border poll for a \"very, very long time to come\". \nThe prime minister told BBC Northern Ireland that as \"a proud unionist\" he views the centenary of Northern Ireland's formation as a cause for celebration. \nHowever only 40% of the people surveyed agreed with the proposition that \"the formation of Northern Ireland 100 years ago was an achievement which should be celebrated\", while 45% disagreed with the statement.\nOutright celebration of the centenary turned out to be the least popular of five options included in the survey. \nIn Northern Ireland, 48% agreed that the partition of Ireland and the creation of a land border 100 years ago was \"a negative development which should be regretted\".\nA total of 50% wanted to concentrate on current challenges such as the Covid pandemic rather than the centenary, whilst 61% backed marking Northern Ireland's formation in a neutral manner acknowledging the differing opinions on the subject. \nThe same proportion, 61%, agreed with the statement \"Northern Ireland's history is not just about constitutional politics and the centenary should provide an opportunity to showcase its sporting, business, scientific and cultural achievements\". \nIn the Republic, celebrating the formation of Northern Ireland was even more unpopular with just 12% agreeing with the proposition. \nThe most popular options were marking this year's centenary in a neutral manner, which was favoured by 74% of those surveyed and regretting partition - a view 71% agreed with.\nThe poll commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme was carried out by the NI Pollsters LucidTalk and the Irish polling firm Ireland Thinks. \nThe margin of error is +/- 2.5%.\nThe results from a number of other questions in the survey regarding what should happen to the Irish flag, national anthem, the Stormont Executive and the health service in the event of a United Ireland will be released on BBC Northern Ireland's political programme The View on Thursday night.  \nFull details of the poll will be available via the BBC NI news website and other BBC news and current affairs programmes during the course of the week. \nView the full, detailed results for Northern Ireland here and the Republic of Ireland here.\nYou can watch Spotlight - A Contested Centenary and The View on the BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "Downing Street has scrapped plans to launch new White House-style press conferences after spending \u00a32.6m on a venue to host them.\nThe PM's media chief Allegra Stratton - who had been due to front the briefings - has confirmed the move to the BBC.\nShe will instead become the spokeswoman for the COP26 climate summit.\nThe government was criticised for the price tag of its new facilities at 9 Downing Street, which will now be used by the prime minister and officials.\nResponding to the news, Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner accused Boris Johnson of \"running scared of scrutiny\".\nShe added: \"Instead of wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on a pointless vanity project, the prime minister should have used the money to give our NHS heroes a pay rise.\" \nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden insisted the venue was \"not a waste of money\" adding that the room previously used for press conferences had been too small and was \"not fit for purpose\".\nHe said the \"modern press facility\" was similar to what other leaders around the world have and would be used by future governments, not just the current one. \nMr Johnson used the room to host a Covid press conference on Tuesday.\nThe plan to hold televised press conferences, similar to those seen in the United States, was announced by Mr Johnson in July last year.\nHe said the daily televised coronavirus briefings being held at the time showed the public wanted \"more direct, detailed information from the government\".\nI lived through a million daily televised briefings by the European Commission, when I worked at the BBC's Brussels bureau. \nI saw how much work officials did to prepare them and how much time was wasted by journalists trying to get spokespeople to deviate from the prepared script. \nI assumed something similar would happen when Westminster got its own version. \nThere have long been rumours that some in Number 10 thought the same way and it seems that they've won the internal argument. \nIt's also surely no coincidence that Downing Street has just appointed a new director of communications, who seems to have a more traditional view of how the government should interact with the media than some previous staffers in Number 10. \nThe total cost of the refit of the briefing room was revealed by a Freedom of Information request from the Press Association - \u00a32,607,767.67, largely excluding VAT.\nCosts included \u00a31,848,695 for the \"main works\", \u00a3198,024 on \"long lead items\", and \u00a333,395 on broadband equipment.\nLabour attacked it as a \"vanity project\" which threatened to \"unbalance\" British politics, and the party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the opposition should be given a right of reply.\nThe briefings fronted by Ms Stratton had been due to start in October last year, but the government said they had been delayed because ministers were continuing to hold coronavirus briefings.\nMs Stratton has been given the job of the government's spokeswoman for COP26 - a UN climate change conference due to take place in November in Glasgow, chaired by former business secretary Alok Sharma.\nShe said: \"I am delighted to be starting this new role.\n\"The COP26 climate conference is a unique opportunity to deliver a cleaner, greener world and I'm looking forward to working with the prime minister and Alok Sharma to ensure it is a success.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed the most significant stage in Scotland's lockdown easing will go ahead as planned on Monday.\nThe biggest changes since the country went into lockdown on Boxing Day will include the reopening of hospitality, gyms and non-essential shops.\nNon-essential travel with England, Wales and Northern Ireland will also be allowed for the first time this year.\nMainland Scotland will move down from level four to three restrictions.\nMs Sturgeon said that if the data continued to improve, the whole of Scotland would move to level two on 17 May. \nThis would allow people to meet indoors in small numbers and see a further easing of hospitality restrictions.\nThe first minister said she hoped that the country would move to level one on 7 June, and then to level zero later that month.\nShe said life should look \"much more like normality\" during July.\n\"We are hopeful, very hopeful, of seeing sustained progress in the weeks and months ahead,\" she said.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that travel restrictions between parts of Scotland and other parts of the UK could be introduced to deal with local outbreaks.\nShe also announced that from Monday lateral flow tests would be available to anyone in the country. The kits can be ordered online or picked up at testing centres in the afternoon and early evening.\nMs Sturgeon encouraged everyone to take advantage of the offer, especially those planning to visit Scotland's islands.\nWhen Scotland moves down to level three restrictions on Monday, it will be possible for: \nFrom this date, takeaways can be collected indoors, non-essential childcare will be allowed, non-essential work can be carried out inside houses and driving lessons and tests can take place again.\nThe first minister said people would be looking forward to doing things they have been unable to do for some time.\nBut she added: \"We must remember that the virus we are dealing with now is much more infectious than it was when bars and cafes were last open so it is really important that as we enjoy these new restored freedoms we continue to be really careful and take all of the required precautions.\"\nHowever, many in the hospitality sector are unhappy with draft guidance.\nThey expected 1m (3ft) social distancing to be in place between tables, but the proposals want people from different households to observe social distancing at tables.\nBut during the briefing Ms Sturgeon said this guidance had not changed since last year.\nThe easing of restrictions on 17 May should enable pubs to open indoors until 22:30 and allow contact sports and some small-scale events to take place.\nFrom that date, up to four people from two households will also be able to meet indoors.\nOther changes could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with indoor group exercise.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said all the public health evidence suggests the country is getting on top of the virus but the government should \"safely and cautiously look to ease these restrictions a little bit quicker.\"\nMr Ross added he would like gyms to open before Monday and he would also have liked more freedom for hospitality from 26 April.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it was right the government took a careful, phased approach to easing restrictions, backed up by data.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"The last thing we need is another lockdown. We have to make sure this is the last one.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton welcomed the developments but called for the country's test and trace system to be \"beefed up\".\nHe added: \"If new strains arrive in the Scotland we must have the resources in place to swiftly crush them before they can spread.\"\nAnd Scottish Greens co-convenor Alison Johnstone said ministers should avoid the temptation to act with haste and continue to listen to the best scientific advice.\nShe also called for the government to be more proactive in terms of quarantine and said people should stay in Scotland for their holidays.\nDr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, called for additional support and compensation for businesses which have not yet been allowed to reopen.\nShe added: \"To translate hope into reality, the business community needs the Scottish government to empower businesses to re-open with sensible guidelines that enable us to get back on our feet.\"\nDavid Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, estimates non-essential stores lost out on \u00a34bn of sales during the first 12 months of the pandemic.\nHe said: \"Re-opening alone isn't a silver bullet which will save Scotland's shops. \n\"While we do expect a level of pent-up demand to return, shopper footfall is likely to be constrained for some weeks yet by the later re-opening of much of hospitality, tourism, and offices in our city centres.\" "

NDAs are unacceptable. I am just horrified by that and horrified by the fact of racism,\" he said. \nTogether with the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, he has written to senior members of the Church, telling them confidentiality agreements are no longer to be used. \nThe Church of England is releasing a report later this week, which it says will include plans to address racism within its own ranks. \nDr Elizabeth Henry, the Church's former adviser on race relations, quit her job last year because she said she felt disillusioned. \n\"I felt frustrated by the lack of progress with issues of racism,\" she told Panorama.\nShe said one incident from 2019 particularly stood out. \n\"A really shocking incident was a young black man who received a picture of a banana. But that banana had his head superimposed upon it - and underneath it said: Banana Man. That is a deeply offensive and deeply racist image,\" she said.\n\"He took it to HR [human resources department] and he did file a grievance. And the decision was that it wasn't racist. \n\"That person left, and he received a very small compensation - however he was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\"\nThat agreement means the BBC cannot say where the incident took place. The total number of non-disclosure agreements is also unknown.\nThe Church told Panorama that while it cannot comment on individual cases, \"any [racist] behaviour of the sort described by Dr Henry is unacceptable\"."

      "tags": "Department for Transport,Grant Shapps,Road safety",
      "text": "No more smart motorways without hard shoulders will be able to open without additional safety measures in place, the government has said. \nIt said any new \"all lane running\" roads would need radar technology installed first to detect stopped cars.\nSmart motorways use technology and other measures to cut congestion, such as opening the hard shoulder. \nBut there are fears about their safety after fatal accidents involving stationary cars being hit from behind.\nIn a written statement to Parliament, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that for every hundred million miles driven there were fewer deaths on all-lane motorways than conventional ones.\nBut he added: \"We are determined to do all we can to help drivers feel safer and be safer on our roads - all our roads.\"\nHe said Highways England would now accelerate the introduction of a number of safety measures set out last year.  \n\"Most significantly, radar-based stopped vehicle detection technology will now be installed on all operational all lane running (ALR) motorways by September 2022, six months earlier than planned,\" he said. \n\"Highways England has also made a commitment that no ALR motorways will open without radar technology to spot stopped vehicles, enable lanes to be closed where necessary and get help to drivers quickly.\"\nOther measures include upgrading cameras so motorists ignoring closed lanes indicated by red X signs can be caught and prosecuted, and putting more signs up about distances to emergency refuge areas.\nThe RAC's head of roads policy, Nicholas Lyes, said the motoring organisation was \"concerned that drivers will still need to wait up to 18 months before all cameras are enforcing red X lane closed signs\".\nHe said: \"Enforcement is vital in getting all drivers to obey these signs as anyone who disregards them is at a much greater risk of being in collision with a stranded vehicle.\"\nSmart motorways, which use technology to maintain the flow of traffic and give information on overhead displays, have existed in England since 2002.\nThe \"all lane running\" versions - which involves opening the hard shoulder permanently to drivers - began in 2014. \nBut a coroner in Sheffield found in January that such roads \"present an ongoing risk of future deaths\" after two people were killed when a lorry ploughed into their vehicles while they were stationary on the M1 in South Yorkshire.\nClaire Mercer, whose husband Jason Mercer died in the accident in June 2019, and who now campaigns against smart motorways, said: \"It's all compromises. Nothing is new. Nothing short of giving back the hard shoulder in every single instance will be acceptable.\"\nShe said she was sitting in a coffee shop with her husband Jason just before he was killed.\n\"We were sat chatting. At 8 o'clock he got up to leave, kissed me goodbye, told me he loved me, and apparently he was dead by 8:15,\" she said.\nHer husband and another motorist, Alexandru Murgeanu, had stopped after a minor collision.\nShe said over the past few months support for her campaign had grown exponentially.\n\"I just don't understand why they [the government] are digging in against accepting public opinion... People are starting to get really angry about being ignored.\"\nIn 2019, 15 people were killed on \"all lane running\" and \"dynamic hard shoulder\" motorways. This is four more deaths than in 2018.\nThe number of people being killed on motorways without hard shoulders increased each year from 2015 to 2019, and totalled 39 deaths.\nBy contrast, on so-called \"controlled motorways\" - a type of smart motorway which have variable speed limits and a hard shoulder - there were 24 deaths in that period.\nOn conventional motorways, which cover more of the UK than smart motorways, there were 368 fatalities from 2015 to 2019.\nThe Highways England report found that crashes between moving and stationary vehicles were more likely on such motorways.\nBut collisions between two or more moving vehicles - which is how more people die - were less likely due to speed regulation.\nThe Commons' Transport Select Committee has launched an inquiry into smart motorways, with chairman and Tory MP Huw Merriman warning there are \"genuine worries\" about the roads. \nAnd the AA and RAC have raised concerns that vehicles that break down on sections of road with no hard shoulder face greater dangers than before.\nReacting to the Department for Transport's update, AA president Edmund King said: \"It is encouraging that progress has been made on our demands to make 'smart' motorways safer. The objective should be to create the safest roads we can. \n\"The number one improvement advocated by the AA and our members is to increase the number of emergency refuge areas (ERAs) and retrofit them to older schemes to ensure they are placed at approximately 0.75 miles apart. \n\"More ERAs, together with improving the accuracy of stopped vehicle detection radar, should be the urgent priorities.\"\nThere are plans for about 800 miles of smart motorway in the UK by 2025 - up from just under 500 miles currently. \nAt the moment parts of the smart motorway network are not monitored by radar technology, but by human observation from watch centres.\nIt's the nightmare scenario. Breaking down on a motorway, without a hard shoulder to take refuge on, and with cars and lorries whizzing past inches away.\nThe government says smart motorways are safer than conventional ones. And it points out that hard shoulders themselves are far from safe. People get killed waiting there, too.\nMany motorists will find all this hard to accept, especially when they see other drivers ignoring speed limits or lane closures when incidents occur.\nBut the government needs to convince them. It's cheaper to have smart motorways than bigger roads. \nThat's why it says it's going all out to improve safety on roads it claims are already very safe. It wants to reassure people.\nThe question is, will critics be persuaded?"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Wales business,Welsh government,Welsh Parliament election 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Six people from six households will be able to meet outdoors in Wales from Saturday.\nThe easing of the lockdown rules also mean that from next week pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to re-open to serve customers al-fresco.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was guided by the fact there is lower risk of catching Covid outdoors.\nIt comes after the Welsh government announced gyms could reopen earlier than previously planned.\nCurrently, up to six people from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet outdoors, although children under the age of 11 or carers do not count in the total.\nThe new rule means any six people can meet outdoors, with children under 11 and carers exempt from the rule.\nIt brings Wales roughly in line with England and Scotland, although England does not allow an exemption for children.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Because meeting outdoors continues to be lower risk than meeting indoors, we are able to bring forward changes to allow any six people to meet outdoors.\n\"This will provide more opportunities for people, especially young people, to meet outdoors with their friends. This will undoubtedly have a significant positive impact on people's well-being.\"\nKelly Jolliffe, landlady of the Greyhound Inn and Hotel in Usk, said she was \"very excited\" to re-open, adding she can seat 160 people in her beer garden.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Ms Jolliffe said: \"We don't make masses of profit, but it's about getting people back in here. \n\"Getting the team kind of match fit, if you like, ready to be able to open indoors as well, because it takes probably four to six weeks to get us all back up and running properly.\"\nShe said the phone had been \"ringing off the hook\" with customers wanting to make bookings.\n\"People have just been so supportive and also they're being flexible. What's fabulous is they're phoning and saying, 'Whenever you can fit us in. We know you're going to be busy, so it doesn't have to be a certain time, doesn't have to be a certain table, just fit us in when it suits you'.\"\nDavid Morgan, landlord of the Cross Inn in Maesteg, said that while the new rules were a positive move, but he still had concerns.\nHe said: \"Everything's still vague. We know six people can meet outside -- we found that on Wales Online this morning and the pubs are definitely opening. \n\"What about the other regulations? Do we still do track and trace? We know nothing and we won't find out anything until Thursday. \n\"I've been phoning my main suppliers and the rep there, she's been giving me all of the information. There's other independent brewers I've been picking stuff up off. We've had very little from the government and the council.\n\"We're apprehensive. It all depends on if people come out, when they come out, how they're going to react to coming out because they've been taught how to drink in the house with cheap booze.\"\nEarlier this month, Mr Drakeford announced gyms would reopen earlier than planned - on 3 May instead of 10 May.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the move should have happened \"weeks ago and would've happened in the Welsh Conservative roadmap out of lockdown\".\n\"Labour's insistence on playing politics, rather than following the science, has tragically left Wales with the longest lockdown, worst economic impact and highest death rate in the UK,\" he said.\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: \"This is obviously good news for the hospitality sector which has been so hard hit by Covid, especially during this current lockdown.\n\"I want the Welsh government to ensure that financial support remains for those bars and restaurants who do not have outdoor seating and am calling for support to be given to those businesses who are only able to partially open.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth added: \"This confirmation will be welcome news for some businesses, but many rely on indoor hospitality for their financial viability.\n\"With favourable prevailing conditions, indoor hospitality should be allowed to reopen on May 17th to put the spring back in the step of Welsh business.\"\nWelsh Labour said it had nothing to add to the Welsh government statement.\nWales' Covid case rate has been the lowest of the UK nations since 26 January. It currently stands at 15.9 cases per 100,000.\nOnly 1.7% of Covid tests now result in a positive result - the lowest in Wales since 3 September.\nThe number of \"active\" Covid patients in hospital on Sunday, 105, is also the lowest since the pandemic began, while numbers in critical care with Covid are in single figures for the first time since early September.\nWales is also ahead of the other UK nations in the proportion of people given first and second doses of a Covid vaccine.

      "tags": "Unemployment,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. \nIn the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. \nThe data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. \nThis was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market \"remains subdued\", with five million people employed but still on furlough. \nHead of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Suren\u202fThiru, said:\u202f \"Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. \n\"Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery.\" \nOverall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. \nBut the ONS said younger people were suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. \nPeople aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. \nGerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a \"post-pandemic low\". \n\"This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme.\"\nIt would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s.\nBut the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. \nThis provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. \nThe ONS said the overall jobs market had been \"broadly stable\" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. \nONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market \"remains subdued\" but that there were positive signs. \n\"With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality.\"\nThe Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the \"evolution of the pandemic\".\nHannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy. \n\"We expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months with the reopening of hospitality and retail, provided the government's roadmap to reopening the economy continues to go to plan.\"  "

      "text": "Disabled residents of Grenfell Tower have told a public inquiry that no-one discussed with them how to escape the 24-storey building in an emergency.\nOne woman said it took her 30 minutes to walk down from her 20th floor flat when lifts were not working.\nLawyers for residents and the bereaved have called the fire in June 2017 \"a landmark act of discrimination\" against disabled people.\nIt killed 72 people, including 41% of the tower's vulnerable adults.\nAs part of phase two of the inquiry, examining how the building was managed, disabled residents told how they had no escape routes in an emergency and how many of them struggled to access their own homes when lifts were broken.\nOn one occasion, Corinne Jones said she had to carry her son on her back, all the way down the stairs from her 17th floor flat.\nMonths earlier she had warned the council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, that her son had mobility issues due to an autoimmune condition - and they had assured her there would always be a working lift available.\nBut she said she did not complain to them or the Tenant Management Organisation which ran the building on the council's behalf, because they had never responded to previous complaints and she found them insensitive.\nEmma O'Connor ticked a box to say she had a disability when she moved into a 20th floor flat in Grenfell Tower in 2012, because she needed support to walk. \nStaff from the Tenant Management Organisation did not discuss how she should evacuate the building in the event of a fire, she said.\nShe said it took her 30 minutes to walk down the stairs and when the lifts were broken she sometimes had to stay with family until they were repaired.\nMs O'Connor said the Tenant Management Organisation only gave them selective information about the refurbishment, were unresponsive to complaints and \"rude\" to residents.\nAt the end of her evidence, she said: \"I don't think it's fair that these corporate companies were given the choice to choose what the price tag on our lives should be.\"\nMahboubeh Jamalvatan, who lived on the third floor, also said she had never been given any instruction on fire safety. On the night of the disaster, she had to slide, step-by-step, down the stairs on her bottom because she was unable to walk.\nMaher Khoudair, who used crutches after contracting polio as a child, said there was no escape route with disabled access from the ninth floor flat where he lived with his wife and three daughters.\nThe only route he could take was the stairs, and no-one explained to him what to do in a fire when he moved in.\nHisam Choucair said his mother, Sirria, lived on the 22nd floor and used a walking stick due to a bad back.\nA personal evacuation plan was never made for her, he said. She died in the fire.\nThe inquiry also heard that as people living in the tower became more frustrated with the poor quality of the refurbishment, in which dangerously flammable cladding was installed, the Tenant Management Organisation decided to scrap regular residents' meetings.\nIn a witness statement, project manager Claire Williams said \"meetings could become difficult with disruptive conduct from a small number of residents\".\nNurse Betty Kasote said she felt she had been branded a \"troublemaker\" when she tried to get leaks in her flat fixed, but she said she did not recall anyone being disruptive.\nRosita Boniface, who lived on the 11th floor of the tower for 36 years, said she had never heard a fire drill there.\nShe said she had not asked the Tenant Management Organisation for an evacuation plan for her husband, who is blind \"because I did not think they would care\".\n\"It was always a struggle to get them to respond to my complaints, so I felt that there was no point going to them for help,\" she said."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,UK government,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The role of a former Tory parliamentary candidate and party donor in a \u00a3100m government deal to buy PPE has been revealed after an apparent admin error.\nThe deal for face masks was signed in July, but the names of those involved were blacked out when the contract was finally published seven months later.\nA second document listed Samir Jassal, an ex-councillor who has campaigned with the PM, as the supplier's contact.\nThe government has said ministers have no part in deciding who gets contracts. \nBut it is the latest in a series of revelations about PPE deals awarded to those with government connections. \nAlthough the deal, for protective masks for hospital workers, was signed last year, the details only came to light in March after a court rebuked the government for failing to publish contracts within the legal time frame. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was found to have acted unlawfully for this failure. \nEven when the deal involving Mr Jassal was finally published, the contact details for the supplier were blacked out. Full contracts are routinely redacted when published by the government.\nHowever, in what appears to have been a clerical error, a separate document published with the contract gives Mr Jassal's name. He is listed as the \"supplier's contact\" to Pharmaceuticals Direct Limited, the company paid to supply the masks.\nHe told the BBC he was a consultant for the firm.\nThe contract was negotiated in the aftermath of the first coronavirus wave in the UK. \nAt the time, with a rising global demand for PPE, the government directly awarded contracts under emergency terms, which meant it didn't have to spend time following the usual tendering process.\nHowever, this has led to concerns over why particular suppliers were chosen and accusations of favouring firms with political connections to the Conservative Party.\nMr Jassal, a former Conservative Party councillor, appears well connected to the government.\nHe joined the prime minister on an official trip to a recycling plant in west London last October, and accompanied him on a campaign visit to a Sikh temple during the 2019 general election campaign. \nMr Jassal himself stood as a Conservative candidate in two general elections and he is standing as a councillor again in Gravesham Borough Council in next month's local elections. \nHis LinkedIn profile claims he worked as an adviser to the now Home Secretary Priti Patel between 2014 and 2015. The BBC understands this was unpaid. He describes her as a \"good friend\" on social media. In 2016, he donated \u00a34,000 to the party.\nAt the height of the UK pandemic in 2020, the government set up a \"high-priority lane\" for businesses endorsed by Whitehall officials or politicians, to fast-track PPE orders. Ministers have refused to reveal the full list of firms that went through this fast lane.\nIn November, the spending watchdog found these companies were 10 times more likely to win contracts than suppliers that came through the normal route. \nMr Jassal's involvement in the \u00a3100m face masks contract was uncovered by the Good Law Project, a campaign group which took the government to court over not publishing PPE contracts. It is now seeking to bring a case against the government in relation to this contract.\n\"It's of profound public importance that we discover who has benefited from the special arrangements put in place, who has benefited from the billions of public money spent, and at whose direction,\" Gemma Abbott, the group's legal director told the BBC.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) declined to answer whether Pharmaceutical Direct Limited's (PDL) contract was processed as part of the high-priority lane.\nMr Jassal says PDL has 20 years' experience in the healthcare sector and it asked to supply PPE via an online government portal. The company, he said, had supplied PPE to various outlets for many years. \nDespite costing more than \u00a3100m, at least two hospital trusts have reported issues with the fit of the model of masks supplied under the contract\nMr Jassal said the masks \"successfully entered the NHS supply chain in a timely manner\" and they met \"all technical standards which were rigorously vetted and approved by the Health and Safety Executive, the DHSC and the NHS\".\nPDL said it had engaged its own independent expert consultants to test and certify that all masks were fully compliant. It said, to the best of its knowledge, all masks supplied had been distributed to, and put to use by the NHS. \nA Department of Health spokesperson said: \"The first duty of any government in a national crisis is to protect the public and save lives, and to do that when confronted with this global pandemic we had to rapidly procure and produce PPE.\n\"This involved setting up a new logistics network from scratch and expanding our PPE supply chain from 226 NHS Trusts in England to more than 58,000 different settings, all of which was taking place at a time when global demand was greater than ever before.\n\"All PPE procurement went through the same assurance process. Due diligence has been carried out on every contract and Ministers have no involvement in deciding who is awarded contracts.\"\n Follow Phil Kemp on Twitter"

      "tags": "Johnson & Johnson,Coronavirus vaccines,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The EU's drugs regulator has said that blood clots should be listed as a \"very rare\" side effect of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe European Medicines Agency said in a statement that it had found a \"possible link\" between the jab and clots.\nBut it added that the benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine outweighed the risks.\nOut of more than seven million people who have received the jab in the US, eight people developed rare blood clots, including one person who died.\nEarlier this month, the EMA made the same recommendation for the Covid-19 vaccine produced by Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nThat recommendation, made on 7 April, came after 86 out of 25 million Europeans administered with the jab developed the unusual blood clots.\nThe UK then stopped administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to people under 30 years old.\nLast week, the EU, the US and South Africa paused the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson jab in response to the reports of rare blood clotting.\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, the EMA recommended that blood clots should be listed as a \"very rare\" side effect of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (also known as the Janssen vaccine).\nThe cases of clotting in the US \"occurred in people under 60 years of age within three weeks after vaccination, the majority in women\", the regulator said.\n\"One plausible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin called heparin induced thrombocytopenia, HIT,\" it said.\nHeparin is a blood thinner given to people with clotting disorders.\nBut the risks associated with the virus itself are still higher than the vaccine, it added.\n\"Covid-19 is associated with a risk of hospitalisation and death,\" the EMA said. \"The reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, and the overall benefits of [the Johnson & Johnson] Covid-19 vaccine in preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.\"\nThese possible side effects seen with the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine and now the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson shot are very rare.\nIt doesn't mean either are no good or unsafe to use in vaccination programmes. \nExperts say, for most individuals, the benefits of getting immunised clearly outweigh any potential risks. \nCovid infection can be extremely dangerous and cause harmful blood clots at a much higher frequency than these ultra-unusual events that have been linked to vaccination. \nAny approved treatment or vaccine will have some side effects and these are listed on or in the pack. \nThe EMA's safety committee says a warning about rare blood clots should be added to the Janssen vaccine's product information. \nExperts are still exploring the link but say it might be related to an unusual immune response in some individuals. \nWhile the risk of developing a blood clot is extremely low, and the risks associated with Covid-19 itself are still greater, the EMA is warning people to be aware of the symptoms of clots if they're getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe symptoms to be aware of after getting the vaccine are:\nIf a person develops any of these symptoms within three weeks of getting the jab, they should seek urgent medical attention."
