      "tags": "China,Shanghai,Art",
      "text": "An art gallery in the Chinese city of Shanghai has apologised for promoting an exhibit that ranked images of women from \"prettiest to ugliest\".\nThe video artwork \"Uglier and Uglier\", by male artist Song Ta, featured about 5,000 images and videos of women in real life on a university campus.\nThe artist then ranked them according to how attractive he found them.\nAfter an outcry on social media, the OCAT Shanghai gallery said it had removed the exhibit.\n\"After receiving criticism, we re-evaluated the content of this artwork and the artist's explanation, we found it disrespected women, and the way it was shot has copyright infringement issues,\" the museum said on China's Weibo social media platform.\n\"As a museum that supports diversity, we will take this as a warning, improve our services and treat everyone with empathy.\"\nOCAT - the OCT Contemporary Art Terminal - is a division of the He Xiangning Art Museum.\nSong created the controversial exhibit in 2013 and it has appeared in several shows since then. \nIn his introduction to the project, he says he recorded the women as they passed by him on a university campus, the South China Post reported. Then he numbered them according to how attractive he found them - from prettiest to ugliest - to create the seven-hour long video. \n\"So if you want to see the campus queen, you have to go to the museum as early as possible. Otherwise, as dusk comes, it will become a living hell in this place,\" he said. \nIn a 2019 interview with Vice magazine, Song said he and a team of assistants had digitally sorted the images under titles such as \"forgivably ugly\" and \"unforgivably ugly\".\nHe defended the work saying: \"I think I have the right to tell the truth.\"\nMany commentators on Weibo were outraged that the gallery had displayed and advertised the \"misogynistic\" and \"intrusive\" artwork.\n\"It's already 2021, how can you still objectify women so boldly, without any shame?\" one said.\n\"This artwork is not only insulting but infringes on individuals' portrait rights, and these women didn't even know they were being filmed,\" another wrote.

      "tags": "Wembley Stadium",
      "text": "Crowds gathered in London's Leicester Square and George Square in Glasgow following Scotland's 0-0 draw with England. \nScotland fans have been celebrating the result, which keeps alive hopes they could still qualify for the next round of the Euro 2020 tournament. \nThere was large police presence in both cities, and in London 30 people were arrested, the Met Police said.  \nMost arrests were made in central London and near Wembley Stadium.\nThe force said offences included violence and disorder, possession of drugs, possession of an offensive weapon, racial aggravation, drunk and disorderly behaviour and assault of a police officer, who suffered minor injuries.\nWhen a \"large\" crowd gathered in Leicester Square, flares were set off as fans, many wearing kilts and draped in Scotland flags, sang Flower of Scotland and chanted \"No Scotland, no party\".\nThe Met Police said at 00:45 BST officers encouraged people still in Leicester Square to leave, finally clearing the area by 01:15 BST.\nTV coverage of the game drew an average audience of 13.1 million, a peak of 20 million and a 79% audience share across ITV and STV. The match set a new streaming record for the channel with 4.8 million streams across ITV Hub and STV Player.\nIt also becomes the most-watched football match in terms of peak viewing numbers since ITV's coverage of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia in 2018, which earned 27.5 million viewers.\nThousands of supporters travelled south for the match despite being urged not to unless they had a ticket or had organised somewhere to watch the game. \nEarlier a dispersal order was issued for central London, giving police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress.\nThere was no indication of disorder in George Square but unauthorised large gatherings are prohibited in Scotland under Covid rules. \nScotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had urged fans to \"be respectful to our hosts\" in London and not to behave in any way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. \nThe 3,000 strong crowd of supporters watching the match at Glasgow's fan zone erupted into huge cheers when the final whistle went on the 0-0 draw. \nAnd at Wembley the Scotland players lapped up the applause of the Tartan Army who stayed behind to celebrate the result as the England fans left. \nA fan zone in Trafalgar Square - where Scotland fans traditionally congregate when their team faces the Auld Enemy - was reserved for 750 key workers. \nMalcolm Gillespie, from Falkirk but living in London, was one of those who managed to secure a space in the area.\nHe said the draw was an \"amazing\" result for Scotland.\nThe 41-year-old, who attended with his son Santiago, eight, said: \"I'm happy but I definitely think we could have edged a win. They've played really well.\n\"It's been fantastic, a really nice atmosphere. I spoke to some English fans who were really friendly. We've loved every minute of it.\"\nMark Cumberworth, 58 and from Essex, said he was disappointed with the result, adding: \"It's almost like we've settled for a draw, which isn't the worst result in the world.\n\"Scotland have played well. England have no chance [of winning the Euros] playing like this.\" \nThe Scotland National Team tweeted that it had been a \"monumental\" effort from \"every one\" of the team. \nAnd Mrs Sturgeon tweeted: \"Yes, sir, you all boogied.\" \nIt was a reference to a video of ecstatic Scotland players dancing to the 1970s disco classic that went viral when they clinched qualification for the tournament by defeating Serbia on penalties in November.\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford tweeted: \"An excellent performance by #Sco - desire, application, organisation and a decent amount of skilful invention.\n\"On another night we might have taken three points not one. Win on Tuesday and we can stay in #EURO2020 Well done @ScotlandNT. You have done Scotland proud.\" \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who attended the match at Wembley, tweeted: \"A fair result given the determination on both sides.\n\"Scotland held that line and made us work for the point.\" \nThe result comes off the back of Scotland's 2-0 loss to the Czech Republic on Monday and England defeating Croatia 1-0 the previous day. \nScotland will face Croatia at Hampden at 20:00 BST on 22 June, while England will play the Czech Republic at Wembley at the same time.\nWembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic.\nScotland's men have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. \nWembley was open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry.\nThe Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. \nIn the absence of access to the stadium or official fan zones, many supporters instead booked to watch the match from pubs and bars across London.\nSome gathered in Hyde Park and Leicester Square throughout the day, with police moving Scotland fans on from the square during the second half of the match. \nIt is understood it came after an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans.

      "tags": "Tesco,Economics,Retailing,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Retail sales fell by 1.4% between April and May as people chose to visit reopened bars and restaurants instead of buying food at supermarkets.\nThe Office for National Statistics said sales fell most significantly at food stores as consumers took advantage of Covid restrictions being lifted in the hospitality sector to eat out.\nIn contrast, sales at non-food shops rose on demand for outdoor furniture. \nThe proportion of online sales dipped as people returned to physical shops. \nIt is the third month in a row that the proportion of online sales has fallen, but the ONS said they \"remain nearly 60% higher than the level seen in February 2020\" before the pandemic.\nThe ONS said that the volume of food sales dropped by 5.7% between April and May.\nNew figures from Tesco for the three months to 29 May appear to follow the trend. It said like-for-like sales grew strongly in March before \"moderating\" in April and May.\nTesco said that compared to the same period last year - when supermarkets experienced a rush in trade during the first lockdown - sales across the group rose by 1%.In the UK alone, trade rose by 0.5%.\nCompared with the first quarter of 2019 before the pandemic, Tesco said sales were up by 8.1%.\nONS data shows that sales at non-food shops grew by 2.3% between April and May although there were \"contrasting pictures within the sector\".\nShops selling households goods reported a sharp rise in sales with anecdotal evidence suggesting \"increased spending on outdoor garden furniture in preparation for the summer and the relaxation of social gathering rules\".\nToy and sports equipment retailers also saw a rise in trade.\nConversely, sales fell for both clothing and department stores, but the ONS said this followed strong growth in previous months and compared to May last year clothing shop sales rose 28.9% and department stores increased by 12.6%.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said that while the 1.4% fall in retail sales was \"disappointing\",  he said it \"may not mean that overall consumer spending is much weaker than we have been expecting if there was just a bigger shift in spending from the shops to the pubs as indoor hospitality reopened in mid-May\".\nWe did more socialising and less shopping last month. Tesco only managed to eke out sales growth of 0.5% in the UK for its first quarter of the year. But the business has now started to come up against some tough comparisons with the start of the pandemic last year when supermarket sales went through the roof as shoppers stockpiled and the first lockdown began.\nIt's going to be hard going for all our supermarkets to deliver much growth this year given the stonking sales they enjoyed last year. \nTesco's boss, Ken Murphy, says customer behaviour is also starting to normalise with smaller shopping baskets and people making frequent trips to the aisles.\nBut Tesco's online sales remain strong with some 1.3 million orders being fulfilled every week. Like a number of other businesses, it's also experiencing a shortage in HGV drivers but Mr Murphy thinks this is something that Tesco can manage.\nHowever, Pantheon Macroeconomics said more up-to-date data \"tentatively suggest(s) that the recovery in households' spending is struggling to progress\". \nThe Bank of England said that credit and debit card payments in the seven days to 10 June were 5% lower compared to February last year before the pandemic. This is worse than the 1.5% decline recorded in May when compared to February 2020.\nIt also said figures from restaurant reservation firm OpenTable indicated that \"restaurant diner numbers peaked in the second half of May and subsequently have nearly returned to normal levels for the time of the year\".\nPantheon's chief UK economist, Samuel Tombs, said: \"We continue to think that the recovery in households' spending will lose momentum as it approaches its pre-Covid level later this year.\n\"Households' real disposable income looks set to fall in the fourth quarter, as the end of the furlough scheme reduces employment and inflation rises to match wage growth.\""

His wife, 61, pleaded guilty to misdemeanour harassment and was fined $2,000. \nBecause the charges are misdemeanours, the personal injury lawyers can keep their law licences and continue to own firearms. \nJudge David Mason accepted their guilty pleas, but rejected their request to donate Mr McCloskey's rifle in a fundraiser, US media said. \nA grand jury had indicted the couple on felony charges, which would have sent them to jail if convicted. But special prosecutor Richard Callahan said in a statement he opted for misdemeanour charges for a series of factors including \"the age and lack of a criminal record for the McCloskeys, the fact they initially called the police, and the fact that no-one was hurt and no shots were fired\". \nMr Callahan described the demonstrators as a \"racially mixed and peaceful group, including women and children\", who had made a wrong turn on the way to their protest. There was no evidence the group was armed, he said. \nParticipants had marched past the couple's $1.15m mansion on their way to the home of then-St Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. \nThe protest came weeks after George Floyd's death while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His murder incited a wave of demonstrations worldwide, with participants demanding racial equality and an end to police brutality. \nThe McCloskeys have since branded themselves as conservative defenders against left-wing rioters. \nIn May, Mr McCloskey announced he would run as a Republican in a bid for a US Senate seat in Missouri.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is already under way leaving Wales facing a \"serious public health situation\", the first minister said.\nMark Drakeford said Wales may be two or three weeks behind England and Scotland in rising case numbers.\nHe confirmed his decision to pause making major relaxations to coronavirus rules for four weeks.\nOfficials plan to offer a further 500,000 jabs during that time, which will largely be second doses.\nThere had been a \"sustained, week-on-week increase\" in the rate of Covid-19 in Wales, Mr Drakeford said, with the Delta variant originally found in India \"taking hold\".\nMr Drakeford said there was a \"particularly sharp rise\" in people aged under 25.\nWelsh government ministers were considering allowing more people to meet indoors in private homes, before delaying the plans because of the rise in cases.\nThe first minister said the \"job\" of the next few weeks will be \"to do everything we can to prevent\" having to impose lockdown rules again.\nHowever Mr Drakeford is making small changes to wedding reception rules, allowing venues to host as many people as they can safely.\nThe Conservatives called for \"light at the end of the tunnel\" from the first minister, while Plaid Cymru said more support was needed for businesses and those self-isolating.\nWales' Covid infection rate on Friday was 23.6 per 100,000 of the population, compared with 10 a fortnight ago - the first minister said the pattern was being driven by the more transmissible Delta variant.\nMeanwhile, the rate of tests coming back positive has more than doubled to 2.4%.\n\"Our scientific advisers believe the UK is now in the pre-peak stage of a third wave of the pandemic,\" he told a press conference.\n\"Wales may be two to three weeks behind what is happening in England and in Scotland, where tens of thousands of cases have been confirmed, there is widespread transmission and reports of increased hospital admissions as well.\"\nCases in Wales are higher in Conwy and Denbighshire than elsewhere - at 71.7 and 64.8 cases per 100,000 respectively.\nOf all Wales' cases over the last week, 23% were in those two areas.\nNearly half of all cases (47%) in Wales currently involve the under 25s, and more than half (52%) of cases in Conwy and Denbighshire involve this same group.\nCases in the two counties from the age group account for more than 10% of all cases in Wales.\nA total of 74% of local communities have had two or fewer Covid positives in the last seven days.\nHospital numbers remain low although there has been a slight uptick in Covid admissions in Betsi Cadwaladr to nine on Thursday. Only one patient was in critical care with Covid, across Wales, in Cardiff. \nMr Drakeford's decision to delay moving to Wales' lowest levels of coronavirus rules follows decisions taken in Scotland and England to hold off their own plans to ease restrictions - both in response to rising cases driven by the Delta variant.\nHe said Wales was currently \"nowhere near\" needing to impose stricter Covid lockdown rules again in response to concerns about rising transmission.\nThe first minister said the Welsh government was \"pausing\" the relaxation of restrictions \"because we don't want to add fresh risk in to what has become a more risky context\".\nHe said officials were \"not clear\" about \"the full extent to which vaccination has altered the link between falling ill with coronavirus and needing hospital treatment\".\n\"The more people we can vaccinate the stronger the defence will be, and the more certain we will become that we don't need to put anything in reverse,\" added Mr Drakeford.\nMeanwhile Wales' vaccination programme will \"switch into a new emphasis on double doses\" over the next four weeks.\nMr Drakeford said the focus would \"move down the age ranges\" as full vaccination rates were high for older members of the population, 88% for the over 60s, for example.\nHe added the Welsh government will be getting advice \"shortly\" from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on an \"autumn booster campaign\" of Covid jabs.\nDespite the rise in coronavirus rates, the first minister announced a series of small measures he said were designed \"to make those regulations easier to understand and to apply to everyday life\".\nThey included:\nRules in Wales will be reviewed again on 15 July.\nThe Welsh government is also looking at whether rules on face masks in schools could be relaxed.\nThe current rule in Wales is that face coverings should be worn in all areas, including the classroom.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said there will be no immediate change, \"but we will work with schools, local authorities and teaching unions to find ways for the future that they do not need to be worn in every classroom, every day\".\nMeanwhile Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething suggested officials were looking at a pilot for increasing payment for people self-isolating.\nBut he told BBC Radio Wales: \"The challenge is that many good ideas require practical means to deliver them and, in this case, it is the budget we have got with different demands upon it.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives called for Mr Drakeford to give more clarity on when restrictions would be eased further.\nJames Evans, the party's shadow minister for mental health and well-being, said: \"We do have to be cautious with the Delta variant spreading across Wales and the UK. However I would like some light at the end of the tunnel from the first minister.\n\"Hospitalisations are 95% lower than their previous peak, deaths are 99% lower then their previous peak. Eighty per cent have antibodies, 96% of those of the over-65s and in the vulnerable groups have antibodies.\n\"And I think in Wales we do need to have some idea of Freedom Day - the vaccine programme is working, we just need a bit of light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nPlaid Cymru said the pause of easing restrictions \"made sense\", but called for greater support for those directly affected.\nSian Gwenllian, the party's deputy leader in the Senedd, said: \"We don't know how much pressure this will put on our hospitals, so keeping the status quo for a further four weeks does make complete sense, as does the focus on vaccination to maximise protection.\n\"But I do think we need clarity from Welsh government on support measures, for businesses, for those needing to self-isolate, and for the track and trace work of local authorities.\""

      "title": "Why are rape prosecutions falling?",
      "tags": "Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Reality Check",
      "text": " Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has apologised to rape victims for low conviction rates in England and Wales. \nOver the past five years, cases reported to police - and initially recorded as rape - have risen sharply.\nHowever, the proportion making it to court (prosecutions) in that time has more than halved.\nIn the year to the end of March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and Wales. \nThese led to just 2,102 prosecutions, compared with 3,043 in the previous 12 months. \n\"This is devastating news for victims and survivors of rape, and all forms of sexual violence and abuse. There is no disputing how dismal these figures are,\" said Katie Russell from the charity Rape Crisis. \nFrom the point that a crime is reported to the police, to a decision being made in court, there are a number of hurdles that have to be overcome. \nAnd at each stage in the criminal justice system, cases are dropped. \nAs a result, rape prosecutions represent a small percentage of all reported rapes. And an even smaller proportion lead to a conviction - when someone is found guilty. \nSo, what is going on?\nThe police have to gather enough evidence in order to refer a case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) -  the body that conducts criminal prosecutions in England and Wales. \nBut there has been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media. This has made these cases more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims.\nVictims' commissioner Dame Vera Baird said in her annual report that the level of prosecutions has got so low that \"what we are witnessing is the de-criminalisation of rape\". \nShe said that some victims withdrew their complaints because \"they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy\". \n\"This is because many will be required to handover their mobile phones, so that the data can be downloaded to see if it has any bearing on a possible criminal prosecution.\" \nIn July 2020, the CPS and police scrapped the digital consent form that people alleging rape had been asked to sign. This form gave full access to their mobile phone data.\nIt followed a court case brought by the Centre for Women's Justice and an investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office.\nThe government review recommends that \"no victim is left without a phone for more than 24 hours, with an ambition that victims have their own phones returned within this period, with replacement phones being provided in a minority of cases\". \nOnce a case is referred to it by the police, the CPS decides whether there is enough evidence to charge a suspect with a crime. Only after this can it go to court.\nIn the year to March 2020, just 1.4% of rape cases recorded by police resulted in a suspect being charged (or receiving a summons).\nThe CPS has been bringing fewer rape prosecutions over the past few years, which is partly due to fewer referrals by police. This is thought to be in part a reaction to a fall in the number of successful convictions.\nThe victims' commissioner's report says: \"Anecdotally, some police officers say the reason they made fewer referrals was precisely because they knew that CPS were prosecuting fewer cases after 2017.\"\nIn November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had previously had a secret conviction rate target, introduced in 2016 - that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. It was suggested this may have led prosecutors to drop weaker or more challenging cases.  \nThe CPS called it an \"ambition\" or \"benchmark\" and said it had stopped using it in 2018. \nThe End Violence Against Women Coalition brought a legal challenge, arguing the approach had been unlawful, but it was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 15 March. \nThe CPS has launched a five-year blueprint to make sure offenders of sexual violence are brought to justice.\nMax Hill, director of public prosecutions said: \"It is clear that more needs to be done both to encourage victims to come forward with confidence, and to support them through the criminal justice process so the gap between reports of rape and cases that reach the courts can be closed.\"\nIn Scotland, there was a 43% increase in convictions for rape and attempted rape between 2017-18 and 2018-19.\nIn Northern Ireland the number of crown court cases for rape fell by about a quarter from 2017-18 to 2018-19, although the number of defendants convicted of at least one offence was almost the same.\nThe Justice Secretary was asked about whether government cuts were a factor. \nRobert Buckland said: \"Like all parts of public service, big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case.\" \nThe Institute for Government estimated that the budget of the CPS was cut by 28% between 2009-10 and 2018-19 after adjusting for inflation. \nCPS staff numbers fell too:\nIn August 2019, the government announced an extra \u00a385m funding for the CPS to help it investigate violent crime and deal with the \"explosion in digital evidence\". \nAt the time, the FDA union - which represents CPS lawyers - welcomed the investment but warned that \"it is not enough to undo all the damage that has been done by years of cuts\".\nThis piece was originally published in April 2019, but has been updated to include the latest statistics. It was altered on 24 June 2021 to clarify that the CPS is not funded as part of the Ministry of Justice.    \nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Foreign spectators have already been banned.\nThe Olympics, originally meant to happen last year, will open on 23 July.\nThe report by the Japanese medical experts, led by top health adviser Shigeru Omi, was issued on Friday.\nIt said that holding the Games without spectators was the \"least risky\" option and the desirable one.\nHowever, the experts also floated an option that Olympic venues could each hold up to 10,000 spectators.\nThe president of Japan's organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, agreed that a \"no fans\" approach would reduce infections. \nBut she added that she would still explore ways to allow spectators.\nThe final decision is expected on Monday.\nIn a separate development on Friday, officials and volunteers working on the Games started receiving vaccinations.\nPfizer are providing enough doses for 40,000 people, in an effort separate to Japan's national vaccination drive. \nThe Olympics are scheduled to go ahead despite a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases in Japan in recent months.\nA state of emergency in Tokyo is set to be lifted on Sunday, but polls in local media suggest public scepticism to the Games going ahead remains high amid a slow vaccine roll-out.  \nOnly about 16% of the country's population have received one Covid-19 dose so far, according to Reuters news agency.\nThe vaccine doses allocated for Games officials have been supplied by Pfizer as part of a deal agreed with the International Olympic Committee and the Japanese government.\nThose being vaccinated include volunteers and staff working at the athletes village and members of the media covering the Games. \n\"Now that I will be vaccinated, I will feel a little more reassured doing my job,\" Chika Hirai, director of doping control for Tokyo 2020, was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying."

      "text": "Police in the UK are being given new powers to crack down on people flying drones irresponsibly or illegally, with dedicated teams on the lookout for those breaking the rules.\nLast week a drone user was fined more than \u00a35,000 for flying illegally over MI6's building in central London.\nPolice working for Operation Foreverwing can now confiscate drones being flown dangerously.\nThey will also be able to issue on-the-spot fines.\nThe Home Office, which worked closely with the police in setting up Operation Foreverwing in March, said that officers will be given \"the tools needed to tackle drone misuse\".\nThis will include specialist equipment, vehicles and training.\n\"This represents a landmark moment for the UK in tackling this new and developing threat,\" said Shaun Hipgrave, Home Office director responsible for counter-drones.\nUnder the rules, anyone operating a drone that either weighs 250 grams or more, or one fitted with a camera, has to register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Those with drones weighing more than 250 grams must also pass a test on the CAA website.\n\"We've had 200,000 registrations since the system was set up in November 2019 but we think that there are many more out there unregistered, potentially tens of thousands,\" said Jonathan Nicholson, from the CAA.\n\"Our prime concern is about aviation safety and how aircraft and drones can legally share airspace. So the emphasis is on the drone user, because it is much more likely they will see a helicopter or light aircraft, than the pilot of those will see a drone.\"\nHe said that the rules for registered, larger drones were \"common sense\" and include:\nThose flouting the rules face fines, and anyone endangering aircraft could receive a prison sentence of up to five years.\nAs well as safety and privacy issues, the police are also concerned about the use of drones for illegal activities such as smuggling drugs into prisons.\nPolice will be on the lookout for drones, amid some high-profile events happening in the UK, including the current Euro 2020 football competition, and the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November."

      "tags": "Criminal justice system",
      "text": "Rape victims in England and Wales should be able to pre-record evidence and cross-examinations so that they do not have to face perpetrators in court, the victims' commissioner has said.\nIn a new report, Dame Vera Baird has called for the practice to be rolled out \"as soon as practically possible\". \nIt would also reduce stressful waits in the run-up to trials, she told the BBC.\nThe BBC understands the government is considering the move, but it is not clear how it would be implemented.\nA plan will be laid out in a government review due to be published next month.\nIn a review of the provision for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in courts, Dame Vera said pre-recording interviews would relieve unnecessary stress for those who had experienced sexual assault.\n\"We've found that almost everybody who was asked had heard victims say how frightened they were to come to court,\" she said.\nThey did not want to come face-to-face with the defendant or their \"supporters\", she said, nor did they want people in the public gallery.\nShe also said the practice would reduce the wait between the witness giving initial evidence to police and being cross-examined in court, which can sometimes be two years because of backlogs made worse by the pandemic.\nInstead, the evidence and cross-examination could both be filmed soon after the alleged offence, and played to a jury in court once the case reached trial, without any further involvement from the victim. \nDame Vera said this would mean the complainant could give their account \"whilst their memory is good\" then move on - and, if they choose, get therapy without fear that their notes could then be used by the defence.\nShe said asking people alleging rape to wait for years before being cross-examined \"preserves the traumatisation\" and can lead to them withdrawing from prosecution altogether.\nAround 43% of rape complainants dropped out of prosecutions in the nine months to December 2020, according to Home Office figures.\nThose who do proceed can give up if their case is listed for a certain date but cancelled last minute, Dame Vera said, adding: \"It's a torture you don't have to put anyone through.\"\nThe law in England and Wales says that under \"special measures\", witnesses who are classed as vulnerable or intimidated are eligible to pre-record their initial evidence and cross-examination.\nThis practice was rolled out for all vulnerable witnesses - which includes all children - last year. However, it is not currently used for intimidated witnesses, which includes those who allege sexual offences.\nA pilot was introduced in three courts September 2019 and an evaluation has not yet been published.\nThe victims' commissioner's report found that the guilty plea rate was \"notably higher\" when evidence was pre-recorded and the process was less traumatic for witnesses.\nIt also said, more broadly, that too often \"special measures\" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to those who were entitled to them. \nThese measures include the provision of screens to shield witnesses from the defendant in court, and the option to appear in court from a separate room via television link. \nAmong its recommendations is a call for the government to make sure that separate entrances and waiting rooms are available for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and to make greater use of remote centres where witnesses can give evidence without attending court.\nThe BBC understands that a government review to be published next month will also include plans to ask judges to bar the public from courts more often and to ensure mobile phones are returned to victims within 24 hours.\nKatie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales,  told the BBC that these measures, as well as pre-recording evidence, would have the \"potential to improve the unacceptably low levels of criminal justice\" that rape and sexual violence complainants receive.\n\"All sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors have been subjected to trauma and deserve trauma-informed and sensitive treatment,\" she said.\nShe also said the \"significant length of time\" that mobile phones were kept for had been \"a cause for concern for some time\".\n\"Being disconnected from friends, family and support networks at such a difficult and stressful time can undoubtedly be distressing,\" she said.\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: \"We understand how traumatic the court process can be and despite the pandemic we are continuing to improve the support provided for victims.\"\n\"This includes protective screens and video links in every criminal court, more separate waiting rooms as well as piloting the pre-recording of cross-examination for rape victims to help further reduce the stress of attending court,\" it added.\n\"At the same time, a new Victims' Bill - set out in the Queen's Speech - will strengthen the rights of victims at every stage of the justice system.\"\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this video, you can find help and support from BBC Action Line."

      "tags": "Greece,Athens",
      "text": "A 32-year-old pilot has confessed to the killing of his young British wife, Caroline Crouch, police say, in a crime that shocked Greece.\nBabis Anagnostopoulos was picked up after attending his late wife's memorial service on the island of Alonnisos, where she grew up.\nHe had claimed three robbers had broken into the couple's home in Glyka Nera, near Athens, and tied him up on 11 May.\nBut after a lengthy investigation, police said his story did not add up.\nThey found no trace of the gang he claimed had tied him up, suffocated his wife and stolen \u20ac15,000 (\u00a313,000; $18,000) in cash.\nThen they checked a range of technical devices to corroborate his account. Caroline Crouch's biometric watch revealed her pulse readings on the day she died. Babis Anagnostopoulos's movements were also tracked via his mobile phone, and the couple's surveillance system also highlighted discrepancies.\nAlthough the suspect said he had been tied up, police said he had managed to use his phone at the time.\nCrouch, 20, was born in the UK and moved with her parents to the picturesque Aegean island of Alonnisos as a child. She was living with her husband and baby in Glyka Nera when she was attacked.\nIt was ultimately a data trail left by 21st-Century tech that led the police to this breakthrough. \nCaroline Crouch's smart watch showed that her heart was still beating at the time her husband claimed she was murdered. The activity tracker on his phone showed him moving around the house while he said he was tied up; and the recorded time at which data cards were removed from the home security camera also told a different story to his version of events.\nIn a world where we are all generating acres of personal data, all the time, about our health and movements, there are concerns about how secure that information is and whether it could fall into the wrong hands. \nIn this case, however, it has accurately signposted a young woman's final moments.\nPolice initially posted a \u20ac300,000 reward for information in finding the killers, condemning the \"barbarity\" of the crime. \nFive days after his wife's death, the pilot posted an Instagram picture from their wedding with the message: \"Always together. Farewell my love.\"\nDetectives approached him after the memorial service on Alonnisos on Thursday, asking him to go with them to Athens, saying there had been a breakthrough in the inquiry and they wanted to identify a suspect. It was only when he arrived in the capital he was told that he was the suspect.\nHe confessed after eight hours of questioning, they said. Greek reports said he told police the couple had often argued in recent months.\nThe killing has become a cause celebre in Greece. Initially it raised concerns about possible domestic security, and the husband had alleged that a foreign gang had carried out the attack. A Georgian man was arrested in the early days of the inquiry as he crossed into neighbouring Bulgaria.\nNational TV interrupted coverage of the Euro 2020 football championships on Thursday night to bring details of the confession. \nCars and passers by stopped outside cafes in Athens to see the latest development, BBC reporter Kostas Koukoumakas reports."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

Seafood or intelligent marine life?\nA group of Conservative MPs think it's the latter and argue they should be included in a law to protect animals. \nThe Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill recognises animal sentience - which is the capacity of animals to have feelings, including pain and suffering. \nIt currently says fish, and other vertebrates which feel pain, should be protected as much as possible.\nAnimals like lobsters and octopus are not currently protected by the bill because as invertebrates, their body is different to ours, so they aren't thought to have those complex feelings, says a report by the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF).\nThe report says arguments against recognising these species focuses on physical differences between these animals and humans - but this fails to understand what it means for an animal to have feelings.\nIt says those species \"undoubtedly experience the world in extremely different ways to ourselves,\" but what matters is whether they feel pleasure and pain.\n\"Animals have helped us quite a lot, so we should return the favour and help them,\" marine biologist Emily Sullivan tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nThe 25-year-old manages the research aquarium at the Marine Biological Association, which means she's worked with lots of invertebrates such as octopus, lobster, crabs, crayfish and cuttlefish.\nShe feels they should be recognised in the bill - which is currently in the House of Lords.\nThere are already regulations around using animals in scientific research, including octopus and squid - though not all species. \n\"The aim of that is to minimise pain, stress and suffering in research,\" Emily says.\n\"I personally do think they can recognise and feel pain, so should be protected more.\" \nHaving interacted with lots of these species, Emily feels they are self-aware and understand what's around them.\n\"It definitely varies between species, and it's not the same level for all of them. But for example cuttlefish, related to octopus, are very intelligent,\" she says.\n\"The ones we have here, when you walk past their tank they come up and have a look, see what you're doing and definitely respond. You can see them watching you.\"\nEmily feels it's clear when they feel pain or suffering \"because their behaviour changes a lot\".\n\"They become quite lethargic and their appetite changes. That's true for a lot of the animals, including crabs and lobsters.\"\nEmily says including them in the bill will have a big impact on the animals themselves because \"they aren't really protected or regulated much\".\nThe report found the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million of species such as squid, octopus, crabs and lobsters each year, and says \"with so many individuals at stake\", it's important to be cautious even if there's not complete certainty these animals are sentient.\nThe new animal welfare legislation will mean any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy. \nThat will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field. \nA spokeswoman from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Newsbeat the UK was \"proud to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world\".\n\"We are fully committed to strengthening them further to ensure all animals avoid any unnecessary pain, distress or suffering,\" she said.\nShe added there is already a review on the feelings of species such as octopus, cuttlefish and squid and the government will \"carefully consider the results\" of this.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "People in Hong Kong have queued up to buy copies of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily a day after its newsroom was raided by police. \nThe front page carried a message of defiance, reading: \"We must press on.\"\nThe paper typically prints about 80,000 copies but increased that to 500,000 to meet demand. Some news stands sold out. \nThe raid on the newspaper came as two of its executives were charged under Hong Kong's controversial new national security law.\nA total of five executives were arrested. Editor-in-chief Ryan Law and chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung were the two charged. \nThe other three, Chief Operating Officer Chow Tat-kuen, Deputy Chief Editor Chan Pui-man and Chief Executive Editor Cheung Chi-wai remain under investigation, police said.\nMs Chan was released on bail late on Friday. She told reporters outside the police station she was saddened by the charges against two of her colleagues and said she was proud of staff for publishing the newspaper earlier that day.\nMr Chow and Mr Cheung remain in police custody.  \nApple Daily, a tabloid, is known for its bold criticism of the mainland Chinese leadership. \nIts billionaire owner Jimmy Lai, a high-profile supporter of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, is already in jail on a string of controversial charges, including allegedly participating in an unauthorised assembly in 2019.\nMr Lai is one of dozens of prominent activists arrested since Beijing introduced the national security law last year.\nAbout 500 police officers descended on the Apple Daily newsroom on Thursday, carrying away computers and hard-drives. Police also froze HK$18m ($2.3m; \u00a31.64m) of assets owned by three companies linked to the paper. \nThe paper broadcast live footage of the raid on its Facebook account. Police were seen sitting at desks accessing reporters' computers.\nIn a media briefing, police said that since 2019, Apple Daily had published more than 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China.\nThe push to complete Friday's edition became a news story itself, with rival media outlets looking on as editors worked. The front page headline \"we must press on\" were the words Mr Cheung told staff as he was led away in handcuffs.\nIn Mongkok district, Hong Kongers queued in the early hours for the first edition. \"Usually we sell around 60 copies but tonight, we just sold 1,800,\" one news stand owner told AFP news agency.\nApple Daily reported that \"some bought 10 or 100 copies at one go to show their support, taking the stacks of papers with them using a trolley or a car\".\nCustomer Steven Chow, who bought three copies, observed: \"There is no perfect media, but it [Apple Daily] is a unique voice in Hong Kong. You may not like it, but I think you need to let them have their voice and survive, it is important.\"\nIt is unclear how long the paper can keep running after the latest asset freeze. \nThe UN's chief human rights spokesperson, Rupert Colville, said on Friday that the newsroom raid sent \"a further chilling message for media freedom\".\n\"We call on Hong Kong authorities to respect their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in line with the Basic Law, in particular freedom of expression,\" he said.\nMartin Yip, BBC News Chinese, in Hong Kong\n\"I had Apple for breakfast,\" an Instagram friend of mine wrote in a post. \"Ate one early in the morning,\" wrote another. Young people here showed off their copies of the edition. News stand agents told me a lot of young people had come to buy the paper - not their usual customers.\nAnd the older generation did it their way. A pensioner who lives in the Yuen Long district bought 10 copies from a news stand and gave them out to passers-by. \"I want to support Apple Daily, and then to support Hong Kong's press freedom,\" she told me.\nCheung Kim-hung, Apple Daily's chief executive, has told his reporters to \"press on\". But as the government freezes its bank accounts, the paper will find it hard to trade. They might eventually find it a problem just to collect money from newsagents. \nIn the longer run, Apple Daily could be disbanded if it is found guilty on charges against it and its two executives under controversial new national security law.\nA reporter on Thursday asked Hong Kong's secretary for security, John Lee if the government would make sure Apple Daily can no longer publish by 1 July - the anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China.\n\"If the law gives us authority to do whatever things, and it's effective and legal, we would do so,\" said Mr Lee, pledging to tackle any perceived threats to national security \"with the strictest measures\".  \nThat is less than a fortnight away."

      "tags": "Metropolitan Police Service,Daniel Morgan",
      "text": "Last week the Metropolitan Police was labelled \"institutionally corrupt\" in its handling of the killing of Daniel Morgan - Britain's most-investigated, unsolved murder. After five separate police inquiries, spanning more than two decades, Mr Morgan's son has said he does not accept their apology.\n\"My dad had an axe embedded in his skull and was left for dead in a murder that was meant to look like a robbery that was actually an execution. That's quite a hard thing to come to terms with really.\"\nDaniel Morgan was only four when his father - also called Daniel - was killed in the car park of the Golden Lion pub, in Sydenham, south-east London, aged 37.\nSo now he's almost the same age, and has a young son of his own. \nHe has clear memories of his father: playing with him, doing puzzles. \nHe recalls his father, who was from Cwmbran in south Wales, teasing him by telling him traditional stories like the three little pigs, but getting the story wrong, so he would have to correct him.\nFor the last 34 years his uncle Alastair Morgan has been the main voice for the family's campaign for justice, but now Daniel Morgan has decided to speak out too. \nMr Morgan said he was angry with the Metropolitan Police's response to the Independent Panel report. \nIt found the force was corrupt in the way it concealed or denied its failings over the unsolved murder.\nThe Met has apologised to the family. \nCommissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she acknowledged \"the extraordinary resilience and determination of Daniel Morgan's family in their pursuit of the truth and for the conviction of those responsible for his murder\".\nMr Morgan said he did not accept that apology.\n\"I think we've heard enough apologies,\" he told the BBC. \n\"What they've said doesn't give us grounds for confidence that they can approach the follow-up work that's clearly required from a document with such gravity.\"\nThe responses so far from the Met have made him angry. \nThey had not accepted the panel's key findings of \"institutional corruption\", he said.\nMr Morgan said another body, either the Home Office or the mayor of London, should take responsibility for ensuring change in the Met. \nAfter the first inquiry in 1987, there were no charges brought, despite the Morgan family repeatedly pushing for new investigations.\nThere have been six inquiries in all, according to the police account, but no-one was ever convicted. \nA planned trial collapsed in 2011, after a judge ruled so-called supergrass evidence could not be used in the case. \nThe panel's report is 1,200 pages long and makes multiple recommendations. \nDame Cressida said she would \"take the necessary time to consider it and the associated recommendations in their entirety\".\nMr Morgan said everyone should read the panel's report - especially the chapters on corruption and the panel's dealings with the police. The panel had to \"fight, fight, fight\" to get information, he said.\n\"It's a personal tragedy for us and a national shame,\" he said. \n\"It's difficult to feel proud of being a Londoner when the people who protect us have failed, and are allowed to fail and there's no consequence for those failings.\" \nThe family called for a public inquiry, and in 2013 then-Home Secretary Theresa May set up the independent panel.\nIts job was to look at the circumstances of Daniel's death, and explore the part played by police corruption and the failure to confront it.\nIn 2011, the Met admitted that corruption had hampered the first inquiry. The panel said there had been a refusal to confront or investigate that corruption.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has requested a detailed response to the report from the Met.\nShe also asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to consider how best it can look into the issues raised.\nMr Morgan said he believed a culture change was needed.\nHe has called on the commissioner to consider her position, though he acknowledged key events in the case took place \"before her time\".\n\"A lot of this happened way before she was ever the commissioner but she is a continuation of the same culture, I'm afraid,\" he said.\n\"The culture of the Metropolitan Police is cancerous and I think the only way you get rid of cancer is you cut it out.\" \nMr Morgan added: \"My son, I don't want his London to be wrapped up in these failings anymore.\"\nSo far, he has declined to have his photograph taken, or do a TV interview. \nHe still lives in the area where his father was murdered, occasionally passing through Sydenham station, just half a mile from the Golden Lion pub. \n\"I quite like a level of anonymity,\" he said.\n\"I want to be able to walk down the street tomorrow and for people not to feel sorry for me, to look at me and say, 'You're that guy whose dad was horrifically murdered.' \n\"Can you imagine what that would be like? Can you imagine?\""

      "text": "Battered and bruised, the DUP has just stepped out of the ring not sure what just happened.\nThe political heavyweight has staggered through the past seven weeks, taking punches from within and not sure how to hit back.\nFrom the first blow to the last, the party was exposed like never before, and the man who will take the blame threw in the towel last night after a verbal punch-up with party officers.\nEdwin Poots masterminded the plot which brutally removed Arlene Foster but he never recovered from the fallout.\nHe had a plan to oust the leader but not to deal with the aftermath.\nFrom day one, his leadership was unravelling. \nHe was on the back foot scrambling to get a grip of the party he helped fracture.\nHe backed down over Arlene Foster's departure date, insisting first it was a matter for the party then allowing his predecessor to set her own timeline.\nHer long goodbye left him a leader in limbo.\nMrs Foster only left the political stage on Monday and her successor just lasted three days free from her shadow.\nHe spent his three weeks as leader looking over his shoulder, lurching from one internal crisis to another.\nFrom stormy party meetings, councillor resignations, a U-turn on north south meetings, allegations of bullying and the Paisley/Morrison anti-Swann stage show. \nBut the fatal blow to his leadership was self inflicted. \nHe promised to be a listening leader, unlike Arlene Foster he said he would never leave his colleagues without a say in big calls. \nThat pledge disappeared on Thursday as he marched out of the DUP meeting with his colleagues pleading with him to change course. \nHe ignored those voices and missed the damning vote, which sealed his fate. \nAs he stood in the assembly chamber nominating his good friend Paul Givan for first minister, others were busy plotting the final push.\nEdwin Poots had run out of \"critical friends\".\nThose including deputy leader Paula Bradley and minister Michelle McIlveen had switched to the other side. \nThe soft support he relied on to get elected leader was gone.\nSo was he, after a four-hour session of hard talking with party officers. \nNo vote of confidence was needed - Edwin Poots had no way back.\nTeam Poots will say that, unlike Arlene Foster, he was removed without a true democratic process, without a vote of no confidence in his leadership. \nSo now the 21 day Poots' reign is over, what next ?\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson is in the wings waiting to take over. \nIt is likely to be a coronation this time, the party can't risk more blood-letting in a contest.\nThe process will run over the next few weeks and already the wagons have been circled.\nThe DUP mobiles, which were so active in the briefings and counter briefings, are no longer being answered.\nThe party is nursing too many wounds which will need some time to heal.\nThat is why Paul Givan will remain as first minister if, as expected, Sir Jeffrey becomes his new boss.\nIt will be his first act of bridge-building but more importantly it will shore up political stability. \nBut long-term, Sir Jeffrey has already indicated that he plans to lead the party from Stormont and may take the job as first minister. \nReshuffling the other Edwin Poots appointed ministers is much easier and less disruptive but don't expect change to happen quickly.\nParty direction didn't change under Edwin Poots.\nHe wasn't there long enough and his leadership take over was all about personalities and not policies. \nBut his short legacy will help his successor. \nLegislating for Irish language at Stormont is now a battle the next leader will not have to fight.\nIt will go through Westminster in the autumn and although the political noise about that prospect will stay with us, the battle is over. \nBut there are many other challenges waiting for the next DUP leader.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol remains top of the in-tray.\nChanging the protocol and renaming it appears to be the party strategy as outlined by Edwin Poots before his departure. \nHis successor may keep to the same path.\nBut dealing with the Irish Sea border will be the easy part for the new DUP leader.\nTackling the border, which runs so deep down the middle of the DUP, might be harder to scrap."

His aides said he did not have Covid-19.\nIn the 1950s, Kaunda was a key figure in what was then Northern Rhodesia's independence movement from Britain.\nHe became president following independence in 1964.\nAs head of the left-leaning United National Independence Party (UNIP), Kaunda then led the country through decades of one-party rule. \nHe stepped down after losing multi-party elections in 1991. \n\"I am sad to inform we have lost Mzee,\" Kaunda's son, Kambarage, wrote on his late father's Facebook page, using a term of respect. \"Let's pray for him.\"\nZambian President Edgar Lungu said the country was mourning \"a true African icon\".\n\"I learnt of your passing this afternoon with great sadness,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"On behalf of the entire nation and on my own behalf I pray that the entire Kaunda family is comforted as we mourn our first president and true African icon.\"\nThe government declared three weeks of national mourning with all forms of entertainment suspended.\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation said Kaunda's contribution to the struggle against colonialism and apartheid would not be forgotten.\nAnother tribute came from Kalusha Bwalya, former captain of the Zambian national football team, who said Kaunda had made \"an immense impact\".\nKaunda - popularly known as KK - was a strong supporter of efforts to end apartheid in South Africa.

      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "The Democratic Unionist Party is to begin the process of finding a new leader following Edwin Poots' resignation after 21 days as leader.\nHe resigned on Thursday night after an internal party revolt over his decision to agree a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in and nominate Paul Givan as first minister. \nA majority of DUP members in the assembly wanted to delay the process.\nIt is believed that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the favourite to succeed Mr Poots.\nThe Lagan Valley MP ran against Mr Poots for the leadership and was narrowly defeated in the wake of Arlene Foster's ousting.   \nMr Poots, who took over as leader in May amid internal tensions about the direction of his leadership and the manner of Mrs Foster's departure, announced his resignation after a meeting of DUP party officers on Thursday night. \nThe BBC understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned at the meeting, but not tabled. \nParty sources described the meeting as \"robust\" and said it had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign.\nThe process to appoint his successor could move \"at pace\", according to one DUP figure.     \nThere are concerns that the instability around Mr Poots' exit could threaten the future of power-sharing at Stormont. \nFocus now turns to who succeeds Edwin Poots, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson will be the popular choice within the party. \nHe will be seen as the man who will possibly be able to heal some of the wounds that have been played out in public. That's not to say that there will not be many who may feel uncomfortable with that, as not everyone voted for him in the recent leadership election. \nThere is a sense, though, that Sir Jeffrey will be coronated - it is unlikely that there will be a leadership contest.\nThe party will want to move pretty quickly now, as it will not want to look back at the sores that were created during Edwin Poots' short reign as leader. \nI think that whoever will take over as leader - most likely Sir Jeffrey - will not want any more political instability.\nSo Paul Givan will probably remain as first minister for now. \nOn Thursday night, Mr Poots said he had asked the party chairman to start the process to elect a new leader, and that he would would remain in post until his successor is elected. \n\"This has been a difficult period for the party and the country and I have conveyed to the chairman my determination to do everything I can to ensure both unionism and Northern Ireland is able to move forward to a stronger place,\" he said.\nA planned North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in Armagh will now not be going ahead on Friday, the Irish government has said. \nThe NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nDUP MLA Jim Wells, a supporter of Mr Poots during the DUP leadership election, described his resignation as sad and \"very unfortunate\".\n\"The DUP did not have a leadership election for 50 years and now we are going to have two in 50 days,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nHe said there were huge issues ahead and the new leader had to have to support of all in the party. \nOn Friday, DUP Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councillor Darren Causby resigned from the party.\nThough he supported Edwin Poots as leader, he disagreed with his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister in defiance of MLAs and MPs.\nHe also does not believe the party will change course under Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\n\"The DUP is not the party I joined and I have been unhappy for some time,\" he said.\n\"We can't allow Sinn F\u00e9in to dictate what happens and that has been the case for some time.\" \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described Thursday as a \"tumultuous\" day. \n\"Clearly the DUP is at a crossroads, and they have a choice to make,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"The choice is to work with the rest of us, to deliver on power-sharing, to deliver rights, or continue to resist those very rights.\"\nShe added that she had not spoken to Mr Givan since Mr Poots resigned. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said there is a crisis within the DUP \"and the brand of unionism that follows them\". \n\"They left the goal open for Sinn F\u00e9in to score. That's why the DUP finds itself in a degree of crisis, whether it's imploding or just a blip, we'll see that in the coming weeks and months,\" Mr Beattie said. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said unionism needed to \"figure out how it wants to engage with the rest of us\".\n\"The last few weeks have been a joke. It has been a real mess for unionism and a mess for all of us,\" he said.\n\"The only way that we can make this place work is to work it together.\"\nAlliance Party MLA Kellie Armstrong said the \"big disaster\" would happen if the new first minister - the DUP's Paul Givan - also resigned. \n\"We have so much to be getting on with. There are ordinary people all over Northern Ireland who still need us to lead. Playing games with politics is just a nonsense,\" said Ms Armstrong. \nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said he was \"astounded\" by the speed with which Mr Poots' leadership came to an end, even though he did not expect it to last.\nHe said Mr Poots had left unionism \"in a weaker position than how he found it\". \nHe said the challenge for unionism was to focus on the main issue, which he said was \"dismantling the protocol and its defeat\".\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that places border in the Irish Sea.\nThere have been growing tensions within unionism and loyalism about the Northern Ireland Protocol, the part of the Brexit deal that created an Irish Sea border.\nUnionists oppose it as they believe it damages the integrity of the UK, and Mr Poots had pledged to get it scrapped as part of his leadership campaign.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it is good that the executive is \"back up and running\". \n\"What we want to do as the UK is ensure we look after the stability of Northern Ireland, the peace process and of course the union,\" he said. \nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said he intends to work collectively with all parties to ensure stability at Stormont.\n\"It will now be a matter for the Democratic Unionist Party to elect a new leader and once that happens we need steady engagement,\" Mr Martin said. \nThis latest issue was sparked after a late-night deal was done between Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP and Secretary of State Brandon Lewis ending a stalemate over Irish language laws to allow for the nomination of a new first minister. \nThe position had become vacant after Mrs Foster formally resigned on Monday, thereby also triggering the resignation of Sinn F\u00e9in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, as it is a joint office. \nMr Poots had named Mr Givan as the DUP's pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach deal that restored power sharing in January 2020.\nThe party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster.\nMr Poots had said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. \nA deal was then struck between the two parties and the secretary of state in the early hours of Thursday morning that would see Westminster legislate for Irish language commitments in October, if Stormont fails to do so beforehand.\nDUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing concern about the deal, ahead of a DUP assembly group meeting which it is understood saw the vast majority of DUP MLAs - 24 to four - oppose Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister as a result of the deal. \nHowever, Mr Poots and Mr Givan left the meeting early, ahead of a special sitting of the assembly which then confirmed Mr Givan and Ms O'Neill as first and deputy first ministers. \nThe Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said the new DUP leader must \"stop the constant flow of concessions to Sinn F\u00e9in\" even if it meant suspending the normal operation of devolution. \nThey urged Westminster to \"retract their ill-thought out and rushed decision to legislate for Irish language at Westminster or risk prompting significant political and community instability\"."

      "tags": "Margate,NHS",
      "text": "An NHS trust has been fined \u00a3733,000 for failures in the case of a baby boy who died seven days after an emergency hospital delivery.\nEast Kent Hospitals had admitted failing to provide safe care and treatment for mother Sarah Richford and her son, Harry, in Margate in 2017.\nThe case followed an inquest that found Harry's death was \"wholly avoidable\".\nThe total \u00a31.1m fine was reduced to \u00a3733,000 due to the guilty plea. The trust apologised to the family. \nThe trust was also told to pay legal costs of \u00a328,000, following the Care Quality Commission (CQC) prosecution.\nAt Folkestone Magistrates' Court, district judge Justin Barron told Mrs Richford and her husband Tom: \"The trust fell far short of the appropriate standards of care and treatment in dealing with you.\" \nHe said the failures led to \"the greatest harm imaginable\".\nHe added the trust was \"very much under the spotlight\" and it was important it took action to restore confidence in its standard of care.\nIn court, Philip Cave, finance director for the trust and a member of the board, acknowledged a series of failures at East Kent Hospitals and apologised to Mr and Mrs Richford.\nHe said: \"I wish to emphasise that the trust does have insight into the failures that led to baby Harry's death and the psychological injury caused to Mrs Richford.\"\nIn April, lawyers for the trust admitted one count of failing to provide safe care and treatment, resulting in avoidable harm to Harry and Sarah Richford.\nIn a statement following the sentencing, the Richford family said: \"Having our lives thrown into the public eye is not what anybody wants to do but sadly this was needed to shine a light on the failings which led to Harry's death in 2017.\"\nThe family said while they welcomed the sanction, they were unsure if the system was suitable for public-funded organisations.\nThey said: \"Taking money away from a financially-challenged resource does seem counterintuitive and we would encourage policymakers to consider any alternative options.\"\nThe family also vowed to support future investigations into maternity safety to ensure \"long-lasting change\".\nBy Mark Norman\nHealth correspondent, BBC South East\nIn every conversation I have had with the Richford family in the past two years they have spoken about three things.  \nTheir concern was initially about finding the truth - until they realised Harry's death might have been avoided if the trust had learned from previous incidents.\nThen, increasingly, the family sought systemic change in the East Kent maternity department so no-one else would experience what they had gone through. \nFor the trust, which successfully cares for hundreds of thousands of patients every year, the Richford case is about reputational damage, and it still isn't over.\nDr Bill Kirkup's investigation into almost 200 births at the trust is not due to report until late in 2022.\nPart of his remit will be to reveal whether or not he believes East Kent Hospitals NHS has learned from this case and potentially hundreds more like it.\nThe inquest last year into baby Harry's death prompted a review after it emerged the trust may have had up to 15 preventable baby deaths.\nDuring the inquest, more than a dozen areas of concern were highlighted over the care of Harry and his mother, including failings in the way an \"inexperienced\" doctor carried out the delivery, followed by delays in resuscitation.\nCoroner Christopher Sutton-Mattocks was told Harry was born not crying, pale, and with no movement in an operating room \"full of panicking people\" at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital (QEQM).\nHe found Harry's death was contributed to by neglect.\nWhen Harry was less than nine hours old he was transferred to a neo-natal intensive care unit in Ashford where he survived for a week with the aid of life support, the inquest heard.\nMrs Richford told the BBC she and her husband were unable to hold him \"until the day that he died\". \nAfter the sentencing, Nigel Acheson, the CQC's deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said: \"The trust's acceptance of responsibility for the errors in Harry and Sarah's care is welcome, but the fact remains that the series of events which led up to Harry's death could and should have been avoided.\"\nHe said: \"In most cases pregnancy and birth are a positive and safe experience for women and their families. But the death or injury of even one new baby or mother is one too many.\"\nSpeaking outside court, Niall Dickson, chairman of the trust, said: \"Harry's parents expected that they would return home with a healthy baby and we failed them. \n\"I know that today we have more senior doctors, more stringent checks on those we employ, we have better training for our maternity staff and better monitoring of babies during labour.\n\"But there is more to do and we will continue to build on the steps that have been taken.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "The study of by-elections is a niche activity. \nBut every now and again one vote comes along that creates a lot of noise. \nThe Liberal Democrats' victory in Chesham and Amersham is one of them. \nIt's a huge win for the smaller party who have been struggling for relevance since the 2019 general election, and arguably since well before that. \nWinning candidate Sarah Green made the most of voters' disquiet over proposed changes to the planning system. \nAnd, while supporting the project nationally, her campaign concentrated on local anxiety about the progress of HS2. \nThe result will give some oxygen to the Lib Dems, perhaps an opportunity for a restart too. \nAnd it's a wallop for the Conservatives, and not just because they have lost a seat in a part of the country they'd expect to colour in blue.\nOn polling day, senior figures in the party expected to shed a load of votes to the Liberal Democrats, but they were not worried that they might actually lose. \nSomething was going on that the Tories' election winning machine didn't fully notice, which may feel like a nasty surprise. \nAnd it underlines some fears among Tory MPs in traditional Conservative areas that \"brand Boris\", with its focus on trying to grab new territory, alienates their core support. \nWhile Mr Johnson was overwhelmingly chosen by party members as their leader, that's not the same as him uniting everyone behind him. \nHe has plenty of detractors inside his own ranks, furious at how provocatively his government has behaved, and frustrated too with some aspects of his political style.\nOverall, the local elections in May were a good set of results in England for a sitting government. \nBut the Tories slipped back in well-heeled parts of the country so, with apologies for introducing another terrible piece of political jargon, were these cracks in the 'Blue Wall'? \nThis by-election result provides more evidence of support sliding around. \nThe Lib Dems were able to benefit from demographic changes, generational changes, and for some voters, a residual concern over Brexit.  \nWith a huge Parliamentary majority still, the Tories aren't going to lose their standing overnight. \nBut the profile of voters in different parts of the country is always on the move. \nOne member of the government worries about how the party can sustain different identities in different places. They say in the south, \"we're like a mid-late term government, in the north we are brand new\".\nBrexit and Boris Johnson reinvented the Conservative Party and made them electable in parts of the country that wouldn't have dreamt of turning blue decades ago. \nSo in reverse, don't be surprised if over time, some parts of the country the Conservatives used to rely on shift away from them too.

      "text": "Some people on furlough are avoiding a return to work because it has been \"great\" for them, former business secretary Dame Andrea Leadsom has said.\nShe said there were some who did not want to go back because they have a garden, have \"great vegetables growing\" and have been able to go walking. \nBut the Conservative MP said there was also a mental health issue about some people fearful of going back.\nThe furlough scheme has helped pay millions of wages during the pandemic.\nA total of 11.5 million jobs have been supported by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and there were 3.4 million people on furlough as of 30 April, according to the latest statistics.\nThere were 5.1 million people on furlough in January.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, Dame Andrea said: \"For some people they're just terrified, so it's like, 'I've been on furlough for so long I really can't quite face going back to the office' and employers are rightly saying, 'well, you need to'.\n\"So there's that issue, the mental health issue, the fear of it.\n\"For other people, it's like, 'well actually being on furlough in lockdown has been great for me - I've got a garden, I've been able to go out walking every day, I've got great vegetables growing, I don't really want to go back to work, maybe I'll think about part-time or I'm going to retire early'.\"\nShe said some businesses in her constituency \"simply can't get people to come back to work\", saying: \"They can't get staff because people have, to be perfectly frank, become used to being on furlough\".\nThe issues \"have very real consequences for our economy\", Dame Andrea said.\n\"If we can't get our economy to bounce back then we can't start to pay this huge bill that we've already incurred for this lockdown, and that's critical at this point.\"\nThe furlough scheme covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.\nAs the economy opens up over the summer, employers who use the scheme have to start paying into it but workers will still receive up to 80% of their pay packet for hours they can't work. The scheme ends on 30 September.\nDame Andrea said on Thursday it was \"disappointing that some staff on furlough have taken on second jobs and then resigned when invited back to work\".\nShe said she asked Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, in the House of Commons what could be done to protect the taxpayer from \"furlough gaming\" and how businesses could be protected.\nReplying, Mr Barclay said it was a \"very important and legitimate point\", saying: \"In terms of the design of the furlough scheme it was designed to operate within the employment law framework, so an employee is able to have a second job whilst on the furlough, providing this is allowed within the terms of their existing employment contract.\n\"But I appreciate the spirit of the point she is raising.\""

      "tags": "Portland",
      "text": "Every member of a police crowd-control unit in the US city of Portland has resigned after one of its officers was indicted on an assault charge.\nThe charge stemmed from violent anti-racism protests that rocked the city, in the state of Oregon, last year. \nProsecutors allege the officer used \"excessive and unlawful use of force\" against a protester in August 2020.\nBut Portland's police union described the decision to prosecute the officer as \"politically driven\".\nThe crowd-control unit, known as the Rapid Response Team (RRT), comprised about 50 police officers. They serve in the team voluntarily and are deployed during events such as riots, large-scale searches or disaster situations.\nIn a statement, Portland police said members had \"left their voluntary positions and no longer comprise a team\". It said the officers would continue in their regular assignments.\nPortland experienced weeks of protests against racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May.\nAmid widespread rioting, vandalism and arson that often took place at night, the RRT was sent in to disperse crowds.\nThe then Trump administration also sent federal security forces to the city in July to protect federal buildings that were being vandalised. However, their deployment exacerbated civil unrest, especially when footage emerged of protesters being grabbed off the street by federal officers and forced into unmarked cars.\nEarlier this week, a grand jury decided to indict Portland police officer Corey Budworth with one count of fourth-degree assault - the first RRT member to face criminal prosecution stemming from the protests.\nVideo of the incident purportedly shows an officer using his baton to push a woman to the ground and then pushing the baton into her face, the New York Times reported.\nThe Portland Police Association said the officer had been \"caught in the crossfire of agenda-driven city leaders and a politicised criminal justice system\".\nActing Portland Police Chief Chris Davis said the mass resignations came after \"a very long complicated history of things that have gone on over the last 14 months\".\n\"I don't think it is just an indictment that caused this to happen,\" he told reporters.\n\"Our entire organisation has been put through something none of us have ever seen through our careers - and at a level and intensity that I don't think any other city in the United States has experienced,\" he added.\nLast October, the then police association president, Daryl Turner, wrote a letter to the city's mayor and police chief asking them to \"stand up and publicly support police bureau members who voluntarily serve on the Rapid Response Team\".\n\"Our RRT members do not volunteer to have Molotov cocktails, fireworks, explosives, rocks, bottles, urine, faeces and other dangerous objects thrown at them,\" he wrote."

      "text": "Iranians have voted to elect a new president, with all but one of the four candidates regarded as hardliners.\nThe winner will replace incumbent Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who has served the maximum two terms.\nDissidents and some reformists have called for a boycott, saying the barring of several contenders has removed any genuine competition.\nThe elections come at a time of widespread discontent among Iranians over economic hardships.\nPolls have now closed, state television reported, although it said voting at some stations has been extended to allow late-comers to cast their ballots. \nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his vote early on Friday morning in Tehran and encouraged people to go the polls. \n\"Each vote counts ... come and vote and choose your president,\" he said. \"This is important for the future of your country.\"\nHowever, there is widespread apathy among voters, after three years of crippling sanctions reinstated by the US when it abandoned a nuclear deal between world powers and Iran.\n\"Whether I vote or not, someone has already been elected,\" a Tehran shopkeeper was quoted by AFP news agency as saying. \"They organise the elections for the media.\"\nAnother, named as Vahid, a woodcraft teacher in the city, told Reuters he would vote \"because my leader [Ayatollah Khamenei] wants me to\".\nThe elections coincide with the latest round of talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the accord, which saw Iran agree to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.\nAlmost 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, registered for the election. \nBut in the end only seven men were approved last month by the 12 jurists and theologians on the hard-line Guardian Council, an unelected body that has the ultimate decision with regard to candidates' qualifications.\nBy Thursday, three of the approved candidates had dropped out.\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first round there will be a run-off election. \nEbrahim Raisi\nThe 60-year-old cleric has served as a prosecutor for most of his career. He was appointed judiciary chief in 2019, two years after he lost by a landslide to Mr Rouhani in the last election.\nMr Raisi has presented himself as the best person to fight corruption and solve Iran's economic problems. \nHowever, many Iranians and human rights activists have expressed concern over his role in the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s.\nAbdolnasser Hemmati \nThe 64-year-old technocrat became governor of the Central Bank of Iran in 2018. He was dismissed from the position after becoming a candidate.\nHis appointments to prominent positions under Mr Rouhani and his hard-line predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are seen as evidence of his ability to work with all factions in Iran.\nBut he faced criticism from the other candidates for failing to mitigate the effects of US sanctions on Iran's currency, whose value has plummeted.\nMohsen Rezai \nThe 66-year-old hardliner is the secretary of the Expediency Council, which advises the Supreme Leader and has ultimate adjudicating power in disputes over legislation.\nHe was commander of the powerful Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and has run for the presidency three times since leaving the force. \nAmirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi\nAmirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi is an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon who has been an MP since 2008 and first deputy speaker since this May.\nThe 50-year-old hardliner is the youngest of the candidates.\nAnalysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian\nThese elections are seen by many Iranians as a brazen power grab by the hardliners who seem to have decided that they can never win free and fair elections, judging by their past performance. With these elections, the hardliners will have all the centres of power in their control. But there will be a downside: greater dissatisfaction among a people already in desperate economic straits, and instability. \nIf Ebrahim Raisi becomes president, the hardliners will want to establish a puritanical system of Islamic government in the vision of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This will bring in more controls on social activities, fewer freedoms and jobs for women, and tighter control of the social media and the press. \nUnder a hardline presidency, Iran would continue to have tense relations with the West. It would continue to push to extend Shia Islam and project power in the region with the help of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major armed, political and economic force in Iran - and its local proxies. Iran would want to cosy up to China in the hope of attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese investment. \nThe election of a hardline president might also adversely affect the current indirect talks between Iran and the US to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement and have the key US sanctions lifted. The hardliners were never happy with the deal in the first place. \nAbout 59 million people are eligible to vote in Iran, which has a population of 80 million.\nTurnout for the last presidential poll in 2017 was 73%, but the most recent survey by the state-backed Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) suggested that it could be only 42% on Friday.\nThat would be a historic low for any election in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and would pose a problem for Iran's leaders, who see turnout as a sign of legitimacy.\nOn Thursday, Mr Rouhani told Iranians not to let the \"shortcomings of an institution or a group\" stop them from voting - an apparent reference to the Guardian Council.\n\"For the time being, let's not think about grievances tomorrow,\" he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is already under way leaving Wales facing a \"serious public health situation\", the first minister said.\nMark Drakeford said Wales may be two or three weeks behind England and Scotland in rising case numbers.\nHe confirmed his decision to pause making major relaxations to coronavirus rules for four weeks.\nOfficials plan to offer a further 500,000 jabs during that time, which will largely be second doses.\nThere had been a \"sustained, week-on-week increase\" in the rate of Covid-19 in Wales, Mr Drakeford said, with the Delta variant originally found in India \"taking hold\".\nMr Drakeford said there was a \"particularly sharp rise\" in people aged under 25.\nWelsh government ministers were considering allowing more people to meet indoors in private homes, before delaying the plans because of the rise in cases.\nThe first minister said the \"job\" of the next few weeks will be \"to do everything we can to prevent\" having to impose lockdown rules again.\nHowever Mr Drakeford is making small changes to wedding reception rules, allowing venues to host as many people as they can safely.\nThe Conservatives called for \"light at the end of the tunnel\" from the first minister, while Plaid Cymru said more support was needed for businesses and those self-isolating.\nWales' Covid infection rate on Friday was 23.6 per 100,000 of the population, compared with 10 a fortnight ago - the first minister said the pattern was being driven by the more transmissible Delta variant.\nMeanwhile, the rate of tests coming back positive has more than doubled to 2.4%.\n\"Our scientific advisers believe the UK is now in the pre-peak stage of a third wave of the pandemic,\" he told a press conference.\n\"Wales may be two to three weeks behind what is happening in England and in Scotland, where tens of thousands of cases have been confirmed, there is widespread transmission and reports of increased hospital admissions as well.\"\nCases in Wales are higher in Conwy and Denbighshire than elsewhere - at 71.7 and 64.8 cases per 100,000 respectively.\nOf all Wales' cases over the last week, 23% were in those two areas.\nNearly half of all cases (47%) in Wales currently involve the under 25s, and more than half (52%) of cases in Conwy and Denbighshire involve this same group.\nCases in the two counties from the age group account for more than 10% of all cases in Wales.\nA total of 74% of local communities have had two or fewer Covid positives in the last seven days.\nHospital numbers remain low although there has been a slight uptick in Covid admissions in Betsi Cadwaladr to nine on Thursday. Only one patient was in critical care with Covid, across Wales, in Cardiff. \nMr Drakeford's decision to delay moving to Wales' lowest levels of coronavirus rules follows decisions taken in Scotland and England to hold off their own plans to ease restrictions - both in response to rising cases driven by the Delta variant.\nHe said Wales was currently \"nowhere near\" needing to impose stricter Covid lockdown rules again in response to concerns about rising transmission.\nThe first minister said the Welsh government was \"pausing\" the relaxation of restrictions \"because we don't want to add fresh risk in to what has become a more risky context\".\nHe said officials were \"not clear\" about \"the full extent to which vaccination has altered the link between falling ill with coronavirus and needing hospital treatment\".\n\"The more people we can vaccinate the stronger the defence will be, and the more certain we will become that we don't need to put anything in reverse,\" added Mr Drakeford.\nMeanwhile Wales' vaccination programme will \"switch into a new emphasis on double doses\" over the next four weeks.\nMr Drakeford said the focus would \"move down the age ranges\" as full vaccination rates were high for older members of the population, 88% for the over 60s, for example.\nHe added the Welsh government will be getting advice \"shortly\" from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on an \"autumn booster campaign\" of Covid jabs.\nDespite the rise in coronavirus rates, the first minister announced a series of small measures he said were designed \"to make those regulations easier to understand and to apply to everyday life\".\nThey included:\nRules in Wales will be reviewed again on 15 July.\nThe Welsh government is also looking at whether rules on face masks in schools could be relaxed.\nThe current rule in Wales is that face coverings should be worn in all areas, including the classroom.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said there will be no immediate change, \"but we will work with schools, local authorities and teaching unions to find ways for the future that they do not need to be worn in every classroom, every day\".\nMeanwhile Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething suggested officials were looking at a pilot for increasing payment for people self-isolating.\nBut he told BBC Radio Wales: \"The challenge is that many good ideas require practical means to deliver them and, in this case, it is the budget we have got with different demands upon it.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives called for Mr Drakeford to give more clarity on when restrictions would be eased further.\nJames Evans, the party's shadow minister for mental health and well-being, said: \"We do have to be cautious with the Delta variant spreading across Wales and the UK. However I would like some light at the end of the tunnel from the first minister.\n\"Hospitalisations are 95% lower than their previous peak, deaths are 99% lower then their previous peak. Eighty per cent have antibodies, 96% of those of the over-65s and in the vulnerable groups have antibodies.\n\"And I think in Wales we do need to have some idea of Freedom Day - the vaccine programme is working, we just need a bit of light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nPlaid Cymru said the pause of easing restrictions \"made sense\", but called for greater support for those directly affected.\nSian Gwenllian, the party's deputy leader in the Senedd, said: \"We don't know how much pressure this will put on our hospitals, so keeping the status quo for a further four weeks does make complete sense, as does the focus on vaccination to maximise protection.\n\"But I do think we need clarity from Welsh government on support measures, for businesses, for those needing to self-isolate, and for the track and trace work of local authorities.\""

      "text": "The Liberal Democrats have pulled off a stunning by-election victory, overturning a 16,000 majority in a seat that has always voted Conservative.\nLeader Sir Ed Davey celebrated by knocking over a wall of blue bricks, claiming his party was now the \"main threat\" to the Tories in many areas. \nThe party's candidate Sarah Green won by 8,028 votes from the Tories, with the Green Party in third place.\nLabour had the worst by-election result in the party's history, with 622 votes.\nThe result is a major boost for the Liberal Democrats after their poor performance at the 2019 general election and brings their total number of MPs at Westminster to 12. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described the result for his party as \"disappointing\".\nAppearing alongside Ms Green at a victory rally in the Buckinghamshire constituency, Sir Ed said: \"This is a great result, a huge swing to us. There are many Conservatives across the country who are now worried.\n\"People have been talking about a red wall, well after Chesham and Amersham and Sarah Green's victory they'll be talking about a blue wall, and how the Lib Dems are the main threat to the Conservatives.\n\"People here felt ignored and taken for granted, and we listened. Sarah Green is going to take these concerns to Parliament and hold this appalling Tory government to account.\"\nIn her victory speech in the early hours of Friday, Ms Green said: \"Tonight the voice of Chesham and Amersham is unmistakable. Together we have said, 'enough is enough, we will be heard and this government will listen'.\"\nLocal opposition to the HS2 rail line, which is being built through the constituency, and the government's planning reforms, which could see more homes being built in rural areas, were major factors in the poll.\nMr Johnson attributed the defeat to local issues and insisted the government was focused on \"uniting and levelling up within regions across the whole country\".\nResponding to suggestions his party's house building plans had led to defeat, he said there had been a \"wilful misunderstanding about the planning reforms\" adding that the government wanted to develop brownfield sites rather than \"build all over the countryside\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, Conservative candidate Peter Fleet warned against reading \"too much\" into his defeat arguing that the result was caused by \"very local circumstances\".\nBut Bob Seely - Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight - told the BBC the government \"badly need to think again about planning\".\n\"This entire system feeds the over-development of the south and the under-development of other areas. It needs to change.\"\nPolling Expert Prof Sir John Curtice said \"in remain-voting middle class seats in the south of England, the Conservative coalition has been weakened to some degree in the wake of Brexit - the Liberal Democrats are best placed to profit from that.\"\nFor the Liberal Democrats, this will be a legendary victory to rank alongside famous by-election upsets of the past.\nWe may be seeing the return of classic Lib Dem \"pavement politics\" - relentlessly campaigning on local issues such as HS2, which the party supports nationally, but opposed locally.  \nMore worrying for the Conservatives, is the apparent backlash against the government's planning reforms.\nBut are there bigger conclusions to be drawn?\nThe Lib Dems claim the political geography of the UK is changing. \nThe party made inroads in some traditional Conservative areas - many of which had majorities for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum -  in the recent local elections in England. \nSome Conservative councillors worried that their party's emphasis on \"levelling up\" and on former Labour seats in northern England could be making some voters in the south feel left behind.\nBut, so far, the Conservatives have been gaining more ground in the north than they have been losing in the south.\nAs for Labour at Chesham and Amersham, their vote collapsed.\nIt's clear that there was tactical voting to oust the Conservatives.\nWhat might be more concerning to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is the sheer extent of this - and that the party's vote was as solid as quicksand.\nThe by-election was caused by the death in April of former Welsh Secretary Dame Cheryl Gillan.\nIn 2019, she retained the seat with more than half of the vote. But the Conservative majority has been steadily decreasing since the 2015 General Election, when it was 23,920, with UKIP coming second.\nIn 2017, it was 22,140 with Labour second with 11,374, and in 2019 the Liberal Democrats got the second-highest number of votes, picking up 13% more than they did in 2017.\nFollowing the by-election, Ben Nunn - director of communications for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - stepped down from his role. He told the BBC it was a \"personal decision\".\nTurnout: 52% (37,954)"

It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 14 other people.\nThere have been a further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, latest daily government figures show.\nAnother 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced.\nLast Friday there were 7,439 cases and six deaths.\nAll adults can now book Covid-19 jabs in England.\nElsewhere in the UK, people aged 30 and over can get their vaccine in Scotland, although in some parts of Glasgow people aged 18 and over can get a first jab.\nIn Wales, people aged 18 and over can get the vaccine, with the Welsh government announcing that all adults had been offered a vaccine earlier this week.\nIn Northern Ireland, people aged 18 and over can book online or call 0300 200 7813.\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency said: \"Cases are rising rapidly across the country and the Delta variant is now dominant. The increase is primarily in younger age groups, a large proportion of which were unvaccinated but are now being invited to receive the vaccine. \n\"It is encouraging to see that hospitalisations and deaths are not rising at the same rate but we will continue to monitor it closely. The vaccination programme and the care that we are all taking to follow the guidance are continuing to save lives.\"\nSarah Crofts from the ONS said: \"Given the recent announcements to delay the easing of lockdown restrictions, it's critical that we are tracking infection rates over the next few weeks and analysing the impact of the Delta variant.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPeople aged 18 and over in England will be invited to book their first Covid-19 jab later, in what the NHS is describing as a \"watershed moment\". About 1.5 million texts are to be sent to people aged 18 to 20 today. \"Offering all adults a jab less than 200 days after the programme launched is one of our country's greatest collective achievements,\" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nRetail sales fell by 1.4% between April and May as people went to reopened bars and restaurants, meaning they spent less at supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says non-food sales were up, with household goods stores reporting strong growth. The proportion of online sales dipped as people returned to physical shops. \nDisruption to surgery in England and Wales during the pandemic will continue to affect millions of patients for years, researchers in Swansea and London say. Hospitals completed 1.5 million fewer surgical procedures in 2020 than would be expected from trends in previous years, a drop of about 33%. The NHS says the shortfall occurred \"because fewer people came forward for care\".\nRules covering indoor wedding and civil partnerships receptions, as well as wakes, in Wales are to change from Monday, with the number who can attend determined by the size of the venue, the Welsh government says. First Minister Mark Drakeford will also announce a four-week pause to further lifting of lockdown rules later, amid concerns over the Delta variant.\nThere was a tearful reunion when twins Minnie Walsh and Patrick Speed were finally able to see each other after a year in different units of the same care home. The pair are able to spend time together again after both received their Covid-19 vaccinations, with Mr Speed saying: \"We were born together and we are back together.\" Ms Walsh says the reunion left them \"full of joy\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\n... the rules on gatherings if you're planning to meet up with mates to watch the England-Scotland match later.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "UK music fans are sitting on hundreds of thousands of tickets for postponed concerts rather than returning them. \nThe latest four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions has pushed an additional 5,000 gigs into doubt. \nArtists such as Rag'n'Bone Man, Olly Murs and Rudimental had scheduled shows between 21 June and 19 July and face a choice of postponing or scrapping gigs.\nIndustry body Live estimates the events scheduled for the next four weeks are worth \u00a3500m to the struggling sector. \nIt also means that fans remain out of pocket to see shows they forked out for many months ago. \nAnn Marshall from Surrey has several tickets booked for concerts such as Michael Bubl\u00e9, Simply Red and Genesis, as well as other events - some of which were postponed from last year.\nShe's hopeful that she will eventually get to attend most of them as these were all to celebrate her 60th birthday last year. \n\"I hate to think how much money I've spent!\" she says.\n\"I'm happy to carry things over as I wanted to see them anyway.\"\nOne of the biggest event agencies in the UK, Ticketmaster, said that 83% of fans are choosing to keep hold of their tickets for rescheduled shows. \n\"Fans are entitled to a refund for any cancelled event and for any rescheduled show if they cannot make the new date,\" said Andrew Parsons, Ticketmaster UK managing director.\n\"But it is great to see an incredibly high amount of fans holding onto their tickets. It just goes to show the unwavering demand from fans to get back to live.\"\nFor lots of people hanging onto gig tickets has been a way of supporting the arts during the pandemic, or provided a little glimmer of hope for their post-lockdown life. Plenty may have forgotten they even had any tickets. \nHowever, lots can change in 16 months, so there's plenty of reasons why gig-goers might not be able to make a new gig date. Similarly, they may have better things to do with that \u00a3100 the ticket company is hanging on to.\nIf an event is cancelled then refunds should be automatic, but if it's postponed then you need to ask. You are entitled to a full refund from the ticket provider, they just don't shout about it. \nIf you bought from a secondary ticket seller like Viagogo or StubHub then check their terms, but you may have to sell the ticket on to get any money back.\nIn automated messages seen by the BBC, gig-goers have been explicitly \"advised\" to keep hold of their tickets to postponed shows by vendor SEE. Neither SEE nor Ticketmaster provide explicit information in messages about applying for refunds. The BBC has approached SEE for comment.\nBut the appetite to keep tickets will be reassuring to an industry crippled by the pandemic. \nGreg Parmley, the chief executive of Live - which represents venues, businesses, crew and artists - said the latest delay to lockdown easing had left businesses and fans unable to enjoy the summer.\nIt also comes in spite of the success of the Events Research Programme, which has enabled trial events to go ahead to examine how large gatherings can take place safely. \n\"The government must now follow its own science if it is to avoid the decline of the UK's world-leading live music industry, which absolutely cannot afford to miss out on another summer of cancelled events after a year on pause,\" said Mr Parmley.

      "tags": "Companies,UK economy,Brexit",
      "text": "UK food and drink exports to the European Union almost halved in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2020. \nThe Food and Drink Federation (FDF) figures show EU sales dropped by 47%.\nThe trade body said the decline was largely due to changes in the UK's trading relationships, but said the pandemic was also a factor.\nThe government said it was \"too early to draw any firm conclusions\" on the long term impact of Brexit.\nIt also said the pandemic had depressed demand.\n\"The most recent ONS trade statistics show that for both March and April, overall exports to the EU have exceeded the average levels across 2020,\" a government spokesperson added.\nRachel Hicks, co-founder and co-distiller at Sky Wave Gin said the \"red tape is strangling\" her business. She said that EU sales \"utterly dropped off a cliff\" in the first quarter, meaning her turnover was down 30%. \n\"The real shame is somewhere like Asia - a fast growing region for gin - is going to potentially snaffle all the markets,\" Ms Hicks said.\n\"We are now unable to quickly send gin to our customers all over Europe and have to wait for HMRC to inspect us every time we send gin abroad.\"  \nGraham Flannigan from Berwick Shellfish in Northumberland, is in a similar position. He said his seafood exports had \"come down drastically\" mainly due to Brexit and the impact of lockdowns.\n\"The logistics systems are moving better now but it's the red tape that is having to be built into the cost of the goods and this is having a knock on effect,\" he added. \nDominic Goudie, the FDF's head of international trade, said the drop in exports his federation had recorded was a \"disaster\" for the industry.\n\"It is a very clear indication of the scale of losses that UK manufacturers face in the longer-term due to new trade barriers with the EU.\"\nNew trade barriers were not the only factor affecting cross channel trade. The FDF said that the Covid-19 outbreak accounted for a decline of some 10-15%. \nFigures for the quarter were also affected by companies stockpiling ahead of the Brexit-related changes. \nThe combination of these factors, the FDF says, led to significant falls in the value of leading exports. \nCompared with the first quarter of 2019 - before Covid became a factor - exports of cheese were down 72%; fish sales were down 52% and chocolate was down 37%.\nExports of food and drink to nearly all EU nations fell significantly in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year.\nWorst hit was trade with Ireland - normally the sector's biggest overseas market. It was down by more than 70%. But sales to Germany, Spain and Italy also more than halved.\nFor decades, the UK has sold more food and drink to the European Union than to the rest of the world combined. \nHowever, the fall in shipments to Europe means that is no longer the case. In the first quarter exports to non-EU nations made up 55% of the total.\nThe FDF said this is the first time this has happened in at least 20 years. \nOverall, sales to non-EU countries rose by 0.3% - although there was a significant increase in shipments to China.\nSales to the region, which fell in the first quarter of last year due to Covid-related lockdowns, recovered to reach \u00a3200m - well above their pre-pandemic level of \u00a3163m.\nOn 31 December, the so-called 'implementation period', in place since Britain left the EU, came to an end.\nThat meant trade across the channel became subject to new post-Brexit regulations and customs formalities for the first time. \nThis FDF says this has had a particularly significant impact on the trade in products of animal origin and other perishable foods, because it led to significant delays while formalities were completed.\n\"Trade that would take 12 hours in the past can now take a day or even a week,\" said Mr Goudie.\n\"If you lose two days or even three days it takes a big chunk out of the of shelf life of the product, which makes the trade itself less viable.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU has lost a legal battle in Brussels to force Anglo-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca to supply 120m doses of Covid-19 vaccine by the end of June. \nIt went to court last month after the company delayed shipment of the vital vaccines, having originally committed to supply 300m doses by the same date.\nHowever, the EU demand was not satisfied by the judge in Brussels.\nBut the judge did impose a deadline on AstraZeneca to supply doses to the EU over the summer or face hefty fines.  \nBoth the EU and the pharmaceutical company talked up Friday's court order, with Brussels saying it confirmed its position and AstraZeneca saying it welcomed the outcome.   \nThe two-dose Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is one of the big three vaccines, along with those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and has by far the greatest global reach.\nThe judge at the Court of First Instance in Brussels ordered that AstraZeneca should deliver a total of 80.2m doses by 27 September.\nIf the company fails to do so, the order says, it must pay a penalty of \u20ac10 (\u00a38.5; $12) per dose not delivered.\nThe EU's demand for 120m doses by the end of this month was not accepted.\nWelcoming the court order, AstraZeneca said it had already supplied more than 70m doses to the EU and would \"substantially exceed\" 80.2m doses by the end of June.\nIt noted that the order acknowledged that \"the difficulties experienced by AstraZeneca in this unprecedented situation\" had had a \"substantial impact on the delay\" of vaccine deliveries.\n\"AstraZeneca now looks forward to renewed collaboration with the European Commission to help combat the pandemic in Europe,\" it added.\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, also welcomed the order but said it confirmed the Commission's view that AstraZeneca had not lived \"up to the commitments it made in the contract\".\n\"It is good to see that an independent judge confirms this,\" she said. \"This shows that our European vaccination campaign not only delivers for our citizens day by day. It also demonstrates, that it was founded on a sound legal basis.\"\nA lawyer representing the EU said the court order meant AstraZeneca must also use a British factory, Oxford Biomedica, to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to the EU if necessary. The factory has been used to supply the vaccine to the UK.\nAmong other things, the court order says: \"The choice to monopolise the Oxford site for the benefit of the UK and in so doing to deprive the EU of an expressly foreseen production site seems even more prejudicial considering its production capacity is twice that of other sites.\"  \nBut AstraZeneca says the legal judgement does not oblige the company to use the Oxford BioMedica plant to fulfil its contract with the EU.\nA further court ruling is expected in September on whether AstraZeneca made its best efforts to fulfil its advance purchase agreement with the EU.\nThe original June target of 300m doses was agreed in negotiations last summer but was then cut by AstraZeneca to 100m because of production problems and export restrictions. That reduction prompted the EU to make its demand for 120m doses."

      "text": "Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers amid an internal Democratic Unionist Party revolt.\nIt comes after a deal was done ending a stalemate over Irish language laws, with the UK government to legislate if Stormont does not.\nThe assembly nominations took place amid opposition from DUP MLAs and MPs.\nA meeting of party officers took place at the DUP headquarters. \nThose attending include deputy leader Paula Bradley, Lord Morrow, Diane Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Sammy Wilson, Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, William Humphrey, Tom Buchanan and Peter Weir.\nLeader Edwin Poots left the meeting in east Belfast shortly after 20:00 BST, but declined to answer questions from the media. \nBBC News NI understands the vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting.  \nSammy Wilson later said the feeling of the party was \"very, very clear\". \n\"What has been done today... shouldn't have been done and the vast majority of people believe that is the case,\" said the East Antrim MP.\nAsked if he had confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said any leader should \"bring people along with them\" and that could not be achieved by \"ignoring the views of a huge number of people\".\n\"A leader who acts without the support of even a marginal majority of his party has to live with the consequences of that,\" he said. \nAsked on his way into the meeting if there will be a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said: \"Wait and see.\"\n\"I think Edwin has got to ask does he have any confidence in the party now? If he decides to ignore the views of the party, maybe he doesn't have any confidence in us,\" he added. \nThe first and deputy first minister nominations followed a late-night deal after talks involving Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis ended a stalemate over Irish language laws, with Mr Lewis declaring legislation would be brought in by Westminster in October if not first introduced at Stormont. \nBut DUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing their concern at the deal, asking him to meet them \"to explain the basis of your agreement with the secretary of state and Sinn F\u00e9in before any further steps are taken in this process, including the nomination of a first minister\". \nSignatories included Sir Jeffrey and Mr Wilson, as well as MPs Gregory Campbell, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Paul Girvan, and Carla Lockhart, along with Lord Morrow, Lord Browne, Lord Hea, Lord McCrea and Lord Dodds. \nSome DUP MPs also joined the MLA meeting to vote on Mr Givan's nomination, but Mr Poots and Mr Givan left before the vote was taken, walking past Mr Wilson while he was speaking, BBC News NI understands.\nMr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was \"very clear\".\n\"It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,\" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme.\nJust over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way.\nThere is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. \nIt would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. \nIf there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. \nIt will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. \nThat has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together. \nWhile a special sitting of the assembly took place at 12:00 BST to nominate the first and deputy first ministers, former first minister Arlene Foster tweeted to say she hoped everyone was enjoying their day.\nOfficially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. \nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. \nAccepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader \"who had a big heart for the people around him\". \nMs O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy.\nWhen Arlene Foster stood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. \nThey then had seven days to nominate replacements. \nMr Poots had named Mr Givan as its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach deal that restored power sharing in January 2020. \nThe party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. \nMr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. \nWhen a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was \"disappointed\" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly.\n\"However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,\" he said.\n\"If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021.\"\nMr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. \n\"Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,\" he said. \n\"Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive.\"\nMr Poots said his party had not been \"shirking away\" from NDNA, and said there was \"a lot in the cultural package for unionism\".\nHe said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented.\n\"If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. \n\"In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19.\"\nMs McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was \"based on inclusion, respect and equality\".\n\"On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn F\u00e9in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,\" she said.\n\"We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists.\" \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. \n\"If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see \"ransom politics\" holding politicians to account.\n\"What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,\" Mr Beattie said. \nAlliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was \"disappointed\" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. \n\"It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,\" said Ms Long. \nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the \"first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership\".\n\"This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn F\u00e9in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,\" he said.\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland.\nLast week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music.\nThe executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictions to an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

      "text": "Thousands of Scotland fans are in London ahead of their Euro 2020 match with England - but the skirl of the bagpipes has largely been drowned out by a 1970s disco classic.  \nVideos of the Tartan Army belting out Yes Sir, I Can Boogie on the streets of the English capital have been all over social media.\nSo how did the song become the country's unofficial national anthem?\nIt started when a video of ecstatic players dancing to the tune went viral after Scotland clinched qualification for the tournament by defeating Serbia on penalties in November.\nThe song by Spanish duo Baccara spent a single week at the top of the UK charts in 1977.\nBut last year it got a fresh lease of life when it was used by the Keeping the Ball on the Ground podcast as a tribute to defender Andrew Considine. \nThe Aberdeen cult hero - who was called up to the Scotland team for the first time last year at the age of 33 - famously starred in a spoof video of the song on his stag do.\nThe player was unrecognisable as he dressed in drag to strut his stuff to the tune alongside friends and his father, with the professionally-produced video being played on his wedding day in 2015. \nConsidine was an unused substitute for the historic match with Serbia, which saw the Scottish men's team dramatically end more than 20 years of hurt by clinching a place at the European Championships.\nBut a video tweeted by the Scotland National Team after the game showed him in the thick of the action as he boogie-woogied with team mates including Kieran Tierney, Scott McTominay, Leigh Griffiths and Callum McGregor. \nThe video immediately caught the imagination of the Tartan Army, with jubilant fans starting a campaign to get the song back to Number One in the charts.\nNot all the team's heroes had been able to get involved, with midfielders John McGinn and Ryan Christie - who scored Scotland's goal in the match - having to take routine drug tests while the party was kicking off in the dressing room. \nLuckily for McGinn and Christie, the boogie-woogieing did indeed continue long into the night - with fresh footage of celebrations at what appears to be the team hotel in Belgrade being tweeted the next morning.\nThis time the soundtrack of choice was Saturday Night by Whigfield as goalkeeper David Marshall led a conga around the room while teammates chanted his name to the 90s hit. \nMarshall had earlier written himself into Scottish football folklore by saving Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty to clinch victory in the shootout.\nSinger Maria Mendiola, who formed Baccara along with Mayte Mateos, later said she was delighted that the song had found a new audience more than 40 years after its release.\nShe told BBC Scotland: \"With this pandemic, I have been sitting at home and this has uplifted me in a way you cannot imagine.\n\"I will always thank the Scottish team and especially Andy Considine for making me so happy after 43 years.\n\"I saw all the articles and everyone was calling me. I was delighted. I thanked the Scotland team and spoke with Andy over Instagram. He had such nice words.\"\nThe boogieing began in earnest once more as Euro 2020 got under way, with the 12,000 fans who were allowed to be inside Hampden belting out the song ahead of Scotland's opening match with the Czech Republic.\nThe game - Scotland's first in a major tournament for 23 years - ended in a 2-0 defeat.\nBut the result didn't appear to have dampened spirits too much ahead of the eagerly awaited clash with the Auld Enemy at Wembley. \nVideos of fans singing the song on planes and trains as they made their way south for the match have been racking up hundreds of thousands of view on social media.\nAnd regardless of what happens in the game, a certain song will keep the Tartan Army boogie-woogieing all night long."

      "text": "This week, President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which establishes a holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the US.\n\"I've only been president for several months, but I think this will go down, for me, as one of the greatest honours I will have had as president,\" Mr Biden said at the signing event on Thursday.\nSo what is Juneteenth, how did it become a holiday and what do people do to celebrate it?\nOn 19 June 1865 - months after the northern US states defeated the South in a civil war fought over slavery - enslaved African-Americans in Galveston, Texas, were told they were free.\nThe day became known as Juneteenth, a word created by joining the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth\" together.\nThe liberation of enslaved people in Texas came more than two and half years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all enslaved people in the rebellious states to be free.\nThe declaration by General Grainger to bring the Emancipation Proclamation into effect in Texas is seen by many as the end of slavery.\nAlready 49 states and Washington DC formally recognise Juneteenth as a state or ceremonial holiday. South Dakota is the last remaining state.\nWhen he was senator of Illinois, Barack Obama co-sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday, but the law was never passed - even after he became president.\nThis year, companies such as Nike, Uber, Twitter and many others have announced they are giving their employees a paid day off for Juneteenth.\nGovernors in some states, including New York and Virginia, have also declared it a holiday for state employees.\nOn Wednesday, the US House of Representatives backed the legislation by 415-14, a day after it was unanimously approved by the Senate. With the signature of President Biden, it has become law.\nFourteen House Republicans voted against the bill. One lawmaker from Montana said the legislation was all about \"identity politics\". A Kentucky opponent of the bill said its establishment will \"create confusion and push Americans to pick one of those two days as their independence day based on their racial identity\".\nIt is the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr Day was established in 1983.\nThe effort to have Juneteenth declared a federal holiday was decades in the making.\nIn 2016, 89-year-old Opal Lee walked from Texas - where Juneteenth has been a state holiday since 1980 - to Washington DC in an effort to encourage lawmakers.\nShe walked 2.5 miles (4km) each day - representing the two and a half years that it took for enslaved people in Texas to learn that they had been freed.\n\"I've got so many different feelings all gurgling up in here,\" Ms Lee said after Congress approved it as a federal holiday. \"I don't know what to call them all. I am so delighted to know that suddenly we've got a Juneteenth. \n\"It's not a Texas thing or a black thing. It's an American thing.\"\nThe ending of slavery did not do away with racism, and in the years after so-called Jim Crow laws were created to separate black people from white society and limit their civil rights.\nThe legacy of those laws is still being dismantled. \nThe death of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African-Americans at the hands of police have led to anti-racism protests by followers of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nIn addition, some Democrats argue that recent Republican state election reforms making it harder to vote are an effort to disenfranchise minority voters who often lean Democratic.\nLast year, former president Donald Trump postponed an election rally originally planned for 19 June after facing criticism amid nationwide anti-racism protests.\nIt also comes as a fierce cultural debate rages over the history of slavery and how it should be taught in American schools. Some Republican-controlled states have sought to have schools teach the \"patriotic education\" favoured by Mr Trump, and limit or prohibit curriculums that seek to re-examine the importance of slavery to the foundation of the country.\nJuneteenth celebrations and traditions vary across the US. In some states there are parades, and people gather for food and to play games.\nAs well as public readings and singing, picnics and church services, in some states rodeos, contests, concerts and parades are also organised.\nFood also plays an important part, with barbecues being one of the most popular ways of marking the day with family and friends.\nThe most famous dish is called \"the Marcus Garvey salad\", named after the black activist and made with red, green, and black beans."

      "tags": "Surgery,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Disruption to surgery in England and Wales during the pandemic will continue to affect millions of patients for many years, researchers say.\nHospitals completed 1.5 million fewer surgical procedures in 2020 than would be expected from trends in previous years, a drop of about 33%, they say.\nThe NHS says the shortfall was \"because fewer people came forward for care\". \nThe figures include 108,000 (13%) fewer emergency operations, such as for heart disease, appendicitis or broken bones.\nIn England some planned, non-urgent surgery was postponed from mid- April 2020 to allow the health service to focus on the pandemic, and again in December 2020 in response to the second wave. A similar picture was seen in Wales.\nThe researchers accept:\nThey found the biggest shortfall in operations - about 900,000 - was in the semi-urgent category, such as gall-bladders operations and reconstructions following burns.\nAnd there were nearly half a million fewer admissions for planned procedures - such as hip and knee replacements - compared with previous years.\nResearcher Tom Dobbs, from Swansea University Medical School, said the interruption of surgical treatment would be felt by millions of patients for many years and called for urgent and major reorganisation of services. \n\"Delays in the diagnosis and surgical management of cancer patients will lead to an increase in deaths, while those waiting for semi-urgent and elective surgery are likely to experience a worsening of their condition,\" he added.\nRoyal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen said the research underscored the gravity of the growing elective backlog.\n\"We have called for the government to commit \u00a31bn for surgery every year for the next five years to bring surgery back up to more sustainable levels,\" he said.\n\"Importantly, capacity needs to be built into the system so that more beds and more surgical staff are available.\"\nSwansea University Medical School and Queen Mary University of London researchers compared hospital data for all adults having surgery in England and Wales in 2020 with the average levels over the past four years, adjusted for an ageing population.\nBut an NHS official said: \"This study is wrong to compare the data in this way, because actually the reduction in this activity occurred because fewer people came forward for care.\n\"This is why the NHS has been running a campaign throughout the pandemic encouraging people to access services when they need to, as normal.\n\"NHS staff have ensured routine operations have rebounded quickly, with 1.1 million people beginning elective treatment in April alone.\n\"And the NHS is supporting hospitals with an extra \u00a31bn to restore care to pre-pandemic levels.\"\nThe study is published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia.\nA separate study in the same journal looked at 2.6 million patients having surgery in England and found 1.1% had been infected with coronavirus around the time of their operation. People with the infection had a higher risk of death in the 90 days following surgery."

      "text": "A man is preparing to have both his kidneys removed after they enlarged to a potentially \"record-breaking\" size.\nWarren Higgs, 54,  from Windsor, has polycystic kidney disease (PKD) that causes small fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. \nHe said his kidneys had grown so large they could kill him.\nMr Higgs has been speaking about his condition in an attempt to raise funds for an electric recumbent tricycle to use following his operation.\nThe father-of-one said his inherited condition first became an issue for him at the age of 35 when it caused an aneurysm leading to a debilitating stroke that left him paralysed on his right side. \nBut five years ago his kidneys started to grow up to their current size - five times bigger than they should be, according to his doctors. \nThe former accountant said: \"Mine are extreme. They just grow continuously.\n\"Considering your kidneys are meant to be the size of a clenched fist, mine are massive.\n\"They're crushing my lungs, crushing my stomach, and I know they've just done a recent scan and they're crushing my heart now.\n\"It's horrible because I can't move. I can't breathe. You just cant do anything.\"\nHis last scan showed his left kidney to be 42cm (16ins) by 27cm (10.6ins), and his right kidney to be potentially record-breaking at 49cm (19.2in) by 28cm (11in). \nHe said doctors believe his kidneys could weigh three-times more than a kidney believed to currently be the heaviest in the world - a 7.4kg (16.3lb) kidney removed in India. \nMr Higgs faces a \"life-saving\" operation next month to fully remove both kidneys, and life on dialysis post-surgery.\nHe said: \"It's not really a record you want to live with, believe me its horrible. PKD has literally taken away my whole life.\"\nHe hopes fundraising will be able to raise enough money for him to pay for an electric recumbent tricycle to increase his fitness and \"get his life back\" following the operation. \nTaxi firm Windsor Cars and charity Driven Forward have set up a Go Fund Me to help him. \nRoyal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead councillor Wisdom Da Costa, who has been involved in the fundraising, said: \"I have been inspired by his kindness, love for life and get up and go, despite suffering increasingly difficult circumstances in life.\n\"How could you not want to support such a shining light.\" \nMr Higgs added: \"I would like to bring my kidney home, but apparently that's not something you're allowed to do. \n\"I want them to go on my fireplace.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Publisher Bloomsbury says vaccines will be compulsory for UK staff returning to its offices when they reopen.\nThe Harry Potter publisher's decision comes as many firms weigh up the necessity of workforce vaccinations. \nThe government has announced that care home workers in England will be required to have a vaccination or risk losing their jobs.\nAlmost 42 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. \nBloomsbury told The Bookseller magazine, which first reported the story, that it had taken both \"medical and scientific advice\".\n\"The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous.\"\nBank of America has also confirmed that all of its vaccinated employees can return to the office in early September, as more than 70,000 staff have voluntarily disclosed their vaccine status. \nPimlico Plumbers meanwhile, said it would require compulsory vaccination for staff, with the company having already said it would not hire anybody new who was not vaccinated.\nBloomsbury, which is due to reopen on 19 July, made employees aware of the policy in an email ahead of the second May Bank Holiday weekend. \nA spokesperson for the company told The Bookseller that \"the wellbeing of our staff has been our overarching concern in all our decisions since the start of the pandemic\".\n\"We recently reported the tragic deaths of two Bloomsbury staff from Covid. We will continue to make our own decisions, conscious of the serious consequences of making the wrong ones.\n\"Inevitably, not everyone will agree. We accept this and, as with so many decisions in the pandemic, we have to do what we believe is right for the wellbeing of all our staff.\"\nBloomsbury closed its offices before the government instruction to work from home last year. \n\"The failure of the government to lockdown earlier is now blamed for thousands of unnecessary deaths and we know we did the right thing,\" the publisher added.\nIn March, a poll of 2,000 workers, conducted by employee review website Glassdoor, found more than half thought there should be a requirement for staff to have had a Covid vaccination before they go back to the office.\nOf the workers polled, one in seven said they would hand in their notice if they were required to return before all employees had been vaccinated.\nThe GMB union's legal director, Susan Harris, told the BBC the way to increase vaccine take up among workers was to \"educate and reassure them\".\n\"Bullying workers into taking a vaccine they are unsure about is cruel, unfair and a recipe for disaster,\" she said. \n\"Any decision on this approach needs full consultation with both employers and workers and is a finely balanced judgement.\n\"Bosses need to think long and hard before they go down this road - because it contains very real dangers of legal implications.\"\nThe CBI business group told the BBC the bar for compulsory vaccination was high and that vaccines were essential to economic recovery. \n\"There will be few industries where this approach would be appropriate, however in some sectors it could prove necessary,\" said Matthew Fell, chief policy director at the CBI. \nIn April, a survey by Arizona State University and the Rockefeller Foundation found that 44% of companies in North America would require vaccinations for workers, while nearly a third said they planned to encourage jabs but wouldn't mandate them."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nUK coronavirus infections rose slightly in the last week, with an estimated 119,000 people testing positive for the virus, up from 110,000. The Office for National Statistics said about one in every 540 people was estimated to be infected with Covid in the week up to 12 June. It comes as new Public Health England data suggests a single vaccine dose reduces a person's chances of catching coronavirus and needing hospital treatment by about 75%, even with the Delta variant circulating in the UK.\nItaly is to introduce a five-day quarantine for travellers from the UK from Saturday amid growing concern about the spread of the Delta variant. Visitors from the UK will also be required to have mandatory Covid tests, the Italian government said. The new measures could affect Welsh football fans making a last-minute trip to Rome to watch Wales play Italy in Euro 2020 on Sunday. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and the Welsh FA have advised fans not to travel to Italy for the game.\nIt comes as Mr Drakeford warned a third wave of the pandemic was now under way in Wales. The first minister confirmed his decision to pause major relaxations to coronavirus rules for four weeks, explaining that the country may be two or three weeks behind England and Scotland in rising case numbers. The government had been considering allowing more people to meet indoors in private homes before the delay was decided. Officials plan to use the delay to offer a further 500,000 jabs, which will largely be second doses.\nStaff at publishers Bloomsbury who return to the office when it reopens will be required to be vaccinated, the firm has said. The company told The Bookseller magazine, which first reported the story, that it had taken both \"medical and scientific advice\". \"The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous,\" the publisher said. It comes as many firms weigh up the necessity of workforce vaccinations. The government has announced that care home workers in England will be required to have a vaccination or risk losing their jobs.\nComposer Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected the prime minister's offer to add his new musical to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. Boris Johnson this week said he was in talks with the theatre impresario about including his production of Cinderella in the scheme. But on Friday Lord Lloyd Webber declined the offer, saying the theatre industry had been treated as \"an afterthought and undervalued\". However, he rowed back on his threat to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. Instead, he confirmed the show would go ahead at 50% capacity, the current legal limit.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThese are the rules on gatherings if you're planning to meet up with mates to watch the England-Scotland match later.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Chesham,Amersham,Green Party (England and Wales),Labour Party,Liberal Democrats,Sarah Green,Ed Davey",
      "text": "The Liberal Democrats have pulled off a stunning by-election victory, overturning a 16,000 majority in a seat that has always voted Conservative.\nLeader Sir Ed Davey celebrated by knocking over a wall of blue bricks, claiming his party was now the \"main threat\" to the Tories in many areas. \nThe party's candidate Sarah Green won by 8,028 votes from the Tories, with the Green Party in third place.\nLabour had the worst by-election result in the party's history, with 622 votes.\nThe result is a major boost for the Liberal Democrats after their poor performance at the 2019 general election and brings their total number of MPs at Westminster to 12. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described the result for his party as \"disappointing\".\nAppearing alongside Ms Green at a victory rally in the Buckinghamshire constituency, Sir Ed said: \"This is a great result, a huge swing to us. There are many Conservatives across the country who are now worried.\n\"People have been talking about a red wall, well after Chesham and Amersham and Sarah Green's victory they'll be talking about a blue wall, and how the Lib Dems are the main threat to the Conservatives.\n\"People here felt ignored and taken for granted, and we listened. Sarah Green is going to take these concerns to Parliament and hold this appalling Tory government to account.\"\nIn her victory speech in the early hours of Friday, Ms Green said: \"Tonight the voice of Chesham and Amersham is unmistakable. Together we have said, 'enough is enough, we will be heard and this government will listen'.\"\nLocal opposition to the HS2 rail line, which is being built through the constituency, and the government's planning reforms, which could see more homes being built in rural areas, were major factors in the poll.\nMr Johnson attributed the defeat to local issues and insisted the government was focused on \"uniting and levelling up within regions across the whole country\".\nResponding to suggestions his party's house building plans had led to defeat, he said there had been a \"wilful misunderstanding about the planning reforms\" adding that the government wanted to develop brownfield sites rather than \"build all over the countryside\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, Conservative candidate Peter Fleet warned against reading \"too much\" into his defeat arguing that the result was caused by \"very local circumstances\".\nBut Bob Seely - Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight - told the BBC the government \"badly need to think again about planning\".\n\"This entire system feeds the over-development of the south and the under-development of other areas. It needs to change.\"\nPolling Expert Prof Sir John Curtice said \"in remain-voting middle class seats in the south of England, the Conservative coalition has been weakened to some degree in the wake of Brexit - the Liberal Democrats are best placed to profit from that.\"\nFor the Liberal Democrats, this will be a legendary victory to rank alongside famous by-election upsets of the past.\nWe may be seeing the return of classic Lib Dem \"pavement politics\" - relentlessly campaigning on local issues such as HS2, which the party supports nationally, but opposed locally.  \nMore worrying for the Conservatives, is the apparent backlash against the government's planning reforms.\nBut are there bigger conclusions to be drawn?\nThe Lib Dems claim the political geography of the UK is changing. \nThe party made inroads in some traditional Conservative areas - many of which had majorities for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum -  in the recent local elections in England. \nSome Conservative councillors worried that their party's emphasis on \"levelling up\" and on former Labour seats in northern England could be making some voters in the south feel left behind.\nBut, so far, the Conservatives have been gaining more ground in the north than they have been losing in the south.\nAs for Labour at Chesham and Amersham, their vote collapsed.\nIt's clear that there was tactical voting to oust the Conservatives.\nWhat might be more concerning to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is the sheer extent of this - and that the party's vote was as solid as quicksand.\nThe by-election was caused by the death in April of former Welsh Secretary Dame Cheryl Gillan.\nIn 2019, she retained the seat with more than half of the vote. But the Conservative majority has been steadily decreasing since the 2015 General Election, when it was 23,920, with UKIP coming second.\nIn 2017, it was 22,140 with Labour second with 11,374, and in 2019 the Liberal Democrats got the second-highest number of votes, picking up 13% more than they did in 2017.\nFollowing the by-election, Ben Nunn - director of communications for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - stepped down from his role. He told the BBC it was a \"personal decision\".\nTurnout: 52% (37,954)"

It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 14 other people.\nThere have been a further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, latest daily government figures show.\nAnother 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced.\nLast Friday there were 7,439 cases and six deaths.\nAll adults can now book Covid-19 jabs in England.\nElsewhere in the UK, people aged 30 and over can get their vaccine in Scotland, although in some parts of Glasgow people aged 18 and over can get a first jab.\nIn Wales, people aged 18 and over can get the vaccine, with the Welsh government announcing that all adults had been offered a vaccine earlier this week.\nIn Northern Ireland, people aged 18 and over can book online or call 0300 200 7813.\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency said: \"Cases are rising rapidly across the country and the Delta variant is now dominant. The increase is primarily in younger age groups, a large proportion of which were unvaccinated but are now being invited to receive the vaccine. \n\"It is encouraging to see that hospitalisations and deaths are not rising at the same rate but we will continue to monitor it closely. The vaccination programme and the care that we are all taking to follow the guidance are continuing to save lives.\"\nSarah Crofts from the ONS said: \"Given the recent announcements to delay the easing of lockdown restrictions, it's critical that we are tracking infection rates over the next few weeks and analysing the impact of the Delta variant.\""

      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "The Democratic Unionist Party is to begin the process of finding a new leader following Edwin Poots' resignation after 21 days as leader.\nHe resigned on Thursday night after an internal party revolt over his decision to agree a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in and nominate Paul Givan as first minister. \nA majority of DUP members in the assembly wanted to delay the process.\nIt is believed that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the favourite to succeed Mr Poots.\nThe Lagan Valley MP ran against Mr Poots for the leadership and was narrowly defeated in the wake of Arlene Foster's ousting.   \nMr Poots, who took over as leader in May amid internal tensions about the direction of his leadership and the manner of Mrs Foster's departure, announced his resignation after a meeting of DUP party officers on Thursday night. \nThe BBC understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned at the meeting, but not tabled. \nParty sources described the meeting as \"robust\" and said it had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign.\nThe process to appoint his successor could move \"at pace\", according to one DUP figure.     \nThere are concerns that the instability around Mr Poots' exit could threaten the future of power-sharing at Stormont. \nFocus now turns to who succeeds Edwin Poots, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson will be the popular choice within the party. \nHe will be seen as the man who will possibly be able to heal some of the wounds that have been played out in public. That's not to say that there will not be many who may feel uncomfortable with that, as not everyone voted for him in the recent leadership election. \nThere is a sense, though, that Sir Jeffrey will be coronated - it is unlikely that there will be a leadership contest.\nThe party will want to move pretty quickly now, as it will not want to look back at the sores that were created during Edwin Poots' short reign as leader. \nI think that whoever will take over as leader - most likely Sir Jeffrey - will not want any more political instability.\nSo Paul Givan will probably remain as first minister for now. \nOn Thursday night, Mr Poots said he had asked the party chairman to start the process to elect a new leader, and that he would would remain in post until his successor is elected. \n\"This has been a difficult period for the party and the country and I have conveyed to the chairman my determination to do everything I can to ensure both unionism and Northern Ireland is able to move forward to a stronger place,\" he said.\nA planned North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in Armagh will now not be going ahead on Friday, the Irish government has said. \nThe NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nDUP MLA Jim Wells, a supporter of Mr Poots during the DUP leadership election, described his resignation as sad and \"very unfortunate\".\n\"The DUP did not have a leadership election for 50 years and now we are going to have two in 50 days,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nHe said there were huge issues ahead and the new leader had to have to support of all in the party. \nOn Friday, DUP Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councillor Darren Causby resigned from the party.\nThough he supported Edwin Poots as leader, he disagreed with his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister in defiance of MLAs and MPs.\nHe also does not believe the party will change course under Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\n\"The DUP is not the party I joined and I have been unhappy for some time,\" he said.\n\"We can't allow Sinn F\u00e9in to dictate what happens and that has been the case for some time.\" \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described Thursday as a \"tumultuous\" day. \n\"Clearly the DUP is at a crossroads, and they have a choice to make,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"The choice is to work with the rest of us, to deliver on power-sharing, to deliver rights, or continue to resist those very rights.\"\nShe added that she had not spoken to Mr Givan since Mr Poots resigned. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said there is a crisis within the DUP \"and the brand of unionism that follows them\". \n\"They left the goal open for Sinn F\u00e9in to score. That's why the DUP finds itself in a degree of crisis, whether it's imploding or just a blip, we'll see that in the coming weeks and months,\" Mr Beattie said. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said unionism needed to \"figure out how it wants to engage with the rest of us\".\n\"The last few weeks have been a joke. It has been a real mess for unionism and a mess for all of us,\" he said.\n\"The only way that we can make this place work is to work it together.\"\nAlliance Party MLA Kellie Armstrong said the \"big disaster\" would happen if the new first minister - the DUP's Paul Givan - also resigned. \n\"We have so much to be getting on with. There are ordinary people all over Northern Ireland who still need us to lead. Playing games with politics is just a nonsense,\" said Ms Armstrong. \nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said he was \"astounded\" by the speed with which Mr Poots' leadership came to an end, even though he did not expect it to last.\nHe said Mr Poots had left unionism \"in a weaker position than how he found it\". \nHe said the challenge for unionism was to focus on the main issue, which he said was \"dismantling the protocol and its defeat\".\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that places border in the Irish Sea.\nThere have been growing tensions within unionism and loyalism about the Northern Ireland Protocol, the part of the Brexit deal that created an Irish Sea border.\nUnionists oppose it as they believe it damages the integrity of the UK, and Mr Poots had pledged to get it scrapped as part of his leadership campaign.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it is good that the executive is \"back up and running\". \n\"What we want to do as the UK is ensure we look after the stability of Northern Ireland, the peace process and of course the union,\" he said. \nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said he intends to work collectively with all parties to ensure stability at Stormont.\n\"It will now be a matter for the Democratic Unionist Party to elect a new leader and once that happens we need steady engagement,\" Mr Martin said. \nThis latest issue was sparked after a late-night deal was done between Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP and Secretary of State Brandon Lewis ending a stalemate over Irish language laws to allow for the nomination of a new first minister. \nThe position had become vacant after Mrs Foster formally resigned on Monday, thereby also triggering the resignation of Sinn F\u00e9in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, as it is a joint office. \nMr Poots had named Mr Givan as the DUP's pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach deal that restored power sharing in January 2020.\nThe party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster.\nMr Poots had said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. \nA deal was then struck between the two parties and the secretary of state in the early hours of Thursday morning that would see Westminster legislate for Irish language commitments in October, if Stormont fails to do so beforehand.\nDUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing concern about the deal, ahead of a DUP assembly group meeting which it is understood saw the vast majority of DUP MLAs - 24 to four - oppose Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister as a result of the deal. \nHowever, Mr Poots and Mr Givan left the meeting early, ahead of a special sitting of the assembly which then confirmed Mr Givan and Ms O'Neill as first and deputy first ministers. \nThe Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said the new DUP leader must \"stop the constant flow of concessions to Sinn F\u00e9in\" even if it meant suspending the normal operation of devolution. \nThey urged Westminster to \"retract their ill-thought out and rushed decision to legislate for Irish language at Westminster or risk prompting significant political and community instability\"."

      "tags": "Tesco,Economics,Retailing,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Retail sales fell by 1.4% between April and May as people chose to visit reopened bars and restaurants instead of buying food at supermarkets.\nThe Office for National Statistics said sales fell most significantly at food stores as consumers took advantage of Covid restrictions being lifted in the hospitality sector to eat out.\nIn contrast, sales at non-food shops rose on demand for outdoor furniture. \nThe proportion of online sales dipped as people returned to physical shops. \nIt is the third month in a row that the proportion of online sales has fallen, but the ONS said they \"remain nearly 60% higher than the level seen in February 2020\" before the pandemic.\nThe ONS said that the volume of food sales dropped by 5.7% between April and May.\nNew figures from Tesco for the three months to 29 May appear to follow the trend. It said like-for-like sales grew strongly in March before \"moderating\" in April and May.\nTesco said that compared to the same period last year - when supermarkets experienced a rush in trade during the first lockdown - sales across the group rose by 1%.In the UK alone, trade rose by 0.5%.\nCompared with the first quarter of 2019 before the pandemic, Tesco said sales were up by 8.1%.\nONS data shows that sales at non-food shops grew by 2.3% between April and May although there were \"contrasting pictures within the sector\".\nShops selling households goods reported a sharp rise in sales with anecdotal evidence suggesting \"increased spending on outdoor garden furniture in preparation for the summer and the relaxation of social gathering rules\".\nToy and sports equipment retailers also saw a rise in trade.\nConversely, sales fell for both clothing and department stores, but the ONS said this followed strong growth in previous months and compared to May last year clothing shop sales rose 28.9% and department stores increased by 12.6%.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said that while the 1.4% fall in retail sales was \"disappointing\",  he said it \"may not mean that overall consumer spending is much weaker than we have been expecting if there was just a bigger shift in spending from the shops to the pubs as indoor hospitality reopened in mid-May\".\nWe did more socialising and less shopping last month. Tesco only managed to eke out sales growth of 0.5% in the UK for its first quarter of the year. But the business has now started to come up against some tough comparisons with the start of the pandemic last year when supermarket sales went through the roof as shoppers stockpiled and the first lockdown began.\nIt's going to be hard going for all our supermarkets to deliver much growth this year given the stonking sales they enjoyed last year. \nTesco's boss, Ken Murphy, says customer behaviour is also starting to normalise with smaller shopping baskets and people making frequent trips to the aisles.\nBut Tesco's online sales remain strong with some 1.3 million orders being fulfilled every week. Like a number of other businesses, it's also experiencing a shortage in HGV drivers but Mr Murphy thinks this is something that Tesco can manage.\nHowever, Pantheon Macroeconomics said more up-to-date data \"tentatively suggest(s) that the recovery in households' spending is struggling to progress\". \nThe Bank of England said that credit and debit card payments in the seven days to 10 June were 5% lower compared to February last year before the pandemic. This is worse than the 1.5% decline recorded in May when compared to February 2020.\nIt also said figures from restaurant reservation firm OpenTable indicated that \"restaurant diner numbers peaked in the second half of May and subsequently have nearly returned to normal levels for the time of the year\".\nPantheon's chief UK economist, Samuel Tombs, said: \"We continue to think that the recovery in households' spending will lose momentum as it approaches its pre-Covid level later this year.\n\"Households' real disposable income looks set to fall in the fourth quarter, as the end of the furlough scheme reduces employment and inflation rises to match wage growth.\""

Whoever you are, wherever you live, if you are aged 18 or older and you are yet to book your Covid jab, today should be the day you make that happen,\" he said.\n\"Only months after delivering the world-first first jab, hardworking NHS staff have given more than 60 million vaccinations in England alone, saving thousands of lives and giving the entire country hope for a brighter future.\"\nAs of Wednesday more than four in five adults have received a first dose of the vaccine, while 58.2% - or 30.68 million people - are now fully vaccinated.\nThe BBC has been told that a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected to make a statement on the matter in the coming days.\nSpeaking at the NHS Confed Conference on Thursday, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said there was currently a \"further surge\" of coronavirus, with the height of it \"still uncertain\".\nHe said he expected a \"further winter surge\" and said he thought new variants may well lead to booster jabs or revaccination being required over the next two to three years.\nCase rates have risen in all regions of England, according to Public Health England's latest survey report, with the North West seeing the highest rate with 196.9 cases per 100,000 people for the week to 13 June.\nThat compares with 152 per 100,000 people the week before.\nRates are highest among young people with 195.9 cases per 100,000 in those aged 20-29, up from 123.6.\nThe second highest rates are among 10 to 19-year-olds, at 143.3 per 100,000 up from 100.3.\nIn England people can book their vaccination appointment online or by calling 119.\nElsewhere in the UK, people aged 30 and over can get their vaccine in Scotland, although in some parts of Glasgow people aged 18 and over can get a first jab.\nIn Wales, people aged 18 and over can get the vaccine, with the Welsh government announcing that all adults had been offered a vaccine earlier this week.  \nIn Northern Ireland, people aged 18 and over can book online or call 0300 200 7813."

      "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has said his country needs to prepare for both \"dialogue and confrontation\" with the US, and \"especially to get fully prepared for confrontation\".\nThis marks the first time Mr Kim has directly commented on President Joe Biden's administration. \nNorth Korea had earlier snubbed efforts by the new US government to establish diplomatic communication.\nThe US has been calling for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\nBut Pyongyang has repeatedly refused, and the United Nations Security Council has imposed strict economic sanctions on the East Asian state for its nuclear tests.\nMr Kim made his latest remarks at a meeting of senior leaders which started this week in the capital Pyongyang.\nHe said they needed \"especially to get fully prepared for confrontation in order to protect the dignity of our state and its interests for independent development\", as well as to guarantee a peaceful environment and North Korea's security, according to state media outlet KCNA.\nHe also said North Korea would \"sharply and promptly\" react to any developments and \"concentrate efforts on taking stable control of the situation on the Korean peninsula\".\nHis latest comments come days after he formally acknowledged that North Korea was facing concerns over food shortages. \nEarlier this week leaders from the G7 nations, including Mr Biden, called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programme and resume dialogue.\nMr Kim's relationship with Mr Biden's administration has so far been fraught with tension. \nPrior to the US election, Mr Biden had called Mr Kim a \"thug\", and days before Mr Biden's inauguration, North Korea put on a show of force with a massive military parade that showcased a new missile.\nIn April Mr Biden referred to North Korea as a \"serious threat\" to global security, prompting an angry response from Pyongyang which said the statement reflected Mr Biden's intent to \"keep enforcing the hostile policy\" towards the country.\nWashington also recently completed a review of its North Korea policy and said that the US would continue to aim for the eventual complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. \nMr Biden has promised an approach marked by diplomacy and \"stern deterrence\".\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said that \"our policy will not focus on achieving a grand bargain, nor will it rely on strategic patience\".\nThe US would instead pursue a \"calibrated practical approach that is open to and will explore diplomacy with\" North Korea, she said, adding it would focus on making \"practical progress\".\nMr Kim had previously met Mr Biden's predecessor Donald Trump on three occasions, but talks on denuclearisation eventually stalled.\nLeif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, summarised Mr Biden's approach as one that coordinates North Korea policy decisions with allies, while conducting \"step-by-step diplomatic engagement\".\n\"The administration has not offered a detailed roadmap because it wants flexibility to engage Pyongyang when and where progress can be made,\" he said. \n\"Meanwhile, Washington will strengthen deterrence by coordinating strategies, military training, and missile defences with allies.\"\nAnalysis by Nari Kim, BBC Korean Service\nKim Jong Un's seemingly mixed message of preparing for \"dialogue and confrontation\" mirrors remarks by President Biden, who characterised the US approach to North Korea as \"diplomacy and stern deterrence\".\nBy sending out both messages, North Korea is sticking to a kind of wait-and-see strategy with regard to the new US administration. But behind the ambiguity of Kim's message is also a signal that North Korea is willing to return to talks. \nAnd although Kim stressed preparation for \"confrontation\", he refrained from direct criticism of the US or other provocative remarks.\nOne key factor behind that might be North Korea's domestic food insecurity and concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. The country's economy has been battered by tough international sanctions over its nuclear programme and strict border closures against the spread of the pandemic.\nSo the message here is really the status quo - North Korea is signalling its openness to dialogue, but it will not accept the complete denuclearisation demanded by the US. And in the short term, the spread of Covid-19 and food insecurity may put its focus much more at home than abroad. "

      "text": "Planning applications are said to be \"at a standstill\" in Wales due to new targets for phosphate pollution in rivers.\nIn January, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) set new targets for phosphate pollution in Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) across the country.\nFrustrated builders and developers say the targets have created a \"complete impasse\" on developments in some areas.\nThe Welsh government said some factors \"must not be jeopardised\".\nAcross Ceredigion, there are 45 applications at a standstill because of the new rules, including 47 dwellings and 22 other applications. \nPhosphates are naturally occurring minerals found in human and animal waste.\nThey aid growth of plants, but can lead to a dramatic growth in algae and deplete oxygen levels when they enter water courses in large quantities.\nMore than 60% of water bodies in affected areas failed the targets set my NRW, including large swathes of the Usk, Wye and Cleddau rivers, and the lower reaches of the Teifi and the Dee.\nIn Llandysul, local builder Dylan Thomas plans to build 12 houses on the site of a former secondary school.\nBut the planning application has stalled after the council said the additional sewage generated would lead to more phosphates reaching the river.\n\"We employ two or three boys and there was work here for them and for several others who would have come to work here,\" Mr Thomas told the Newyddion S4C programme.\n\"We also had two prospective customers, locals who have come to look at the land and the plans and they want to buy houses.\n\"But at the moment, it's all at a stop and we have no idea when we can restart.\"\nCeredigion MP Ben Lake said something needs to be done to resolve the issue and clear the \"log jam\" that has built up since the start of the year.\nThe situation is especially acute in rural areas like Ceredigion which \"are facing a housing crisis,\" Mr Lake said.\n\"We really don't want to see applications rejected unnecessarily,\" he added.\nIn a statement, the Welsh government said: \"While we prioritise building affordable housing at pace in Wales, the resilience of our river ecosystems and the benefits they provide - including top quality drinking and bathing water to benefit our communities, our businesses and our wildlife - must not be jeopardised.\"\nIn Newport, solicitor Rhys Evans is representing several clients affected by the new guidance. \nHe said there is a lack of clear information and guidance for local authorities and developers, and no solutions to allow developments whilst offsetting potential phosphate increases. \n\"It's something quite incredible to just appear overnight. There was no warning, no one said these rules may be implemented in 12 or 24 months,\" he said.\n\"Everyone knew there was an issue, but no-one knew Natural Resources Wales were going to do what they have done without putting work in place beforehand to ensure everyone knows where they stand.\"\nThe problem is \"complicated,\" according to NRW, who said it was working with others to find a solution.\n\"Solutions such as cleaning the phosphates from sewage are available,\" said Rhian Jardine, of head of planning services at NRW.\n\"And some of Welsh Water's treatment works already do so. It isn't true everywhere at the moment.\"\nWelsh Water said it had invested \u00a385m in projects over the past 10 years to remove phosphorous from its wastewater treatment processes, and plans to invest a further \u00a382m by 2025.\n\"It should be noted that there are a number of factors which contribute to phosphate levels in rivers which are beyond the control of the water industry,\" a spokesperson added.\n\"Our modelling on the River Wye, for example, shows that our assets are responsible for between 25% and 33% of the phosphorus in the main water bodies.\n\"The remainder is caused by other factors such as urban surface water drainage, misconnected drains, agricultural run-off and animal faeces.\""

      "text": "Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events.\nThe PM said earlier this week he was in talks with the theatre impresario.\nBut Lord Lloyd-Webber said on Friday the theatre industry had been treated as \"an afterthought and undervalued\".\nLast week, he said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, he has now rowed back on that.\nOn Monday, the government confirmed that it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July.\nAfter rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, Lord Lloyd-Webber confirmed the show would open next week with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit.\nIf he did open with a full theatre, it \"would be very likely that every member of my cast, crew and orchestra, the front and backstage staff, plus our loyal audience members, could be individually fined \u00a3500, which I couldn't possibly risk\", he said.\n\"If it were just me, I would happily risk arrest and fines to make a stand and lead the live music and theatre industry back to the full capacities we so desperately need.\"\nHe said would go ahead with a socially-distanced audience at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London's West End because he was not able to look his \"young cast and crew in the eyes to tell them we were delaying or closing down\".\nHe said he had turned down the pilot because the offer was not open to other performances.\n\"I have made it crystal clear that I would only be able to participate if others were involved and the rest of the industry - theatre and music - were treated equally,\" he said. \"This has not been confirmed to me.\"\nHe continued: \"It has become clear that, while sporting events like Wimbledon had obviously been working with the government for some time on this pilot, and were even able to start selling tickets yesterday, the theatre industry and its audiences is, once again, an afterthought and undervalued.\"\nThe government said it was \"disappointed\" that he had decided not to take part in the official pilot events, which would have allowed him to have the venue 75% full, rising to 100%.\n\"We are disappointed that Lord Lloyd Webber has decided not to take part in the Events Research Programme, having engaged with his team on exactly the same basis as a wide range of other cultural and sporting events,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"We will be setting out details of the next stage of the programme very shortly, once all public health considerations have been finalised, and this will include a number of other theatres. This research will build on successful pilot events in the arts, music and sport sectors.\"\nThe government pointed out that events including outdoor gigs, club nights, the Brit Awards as well as the Crucible theatre had already been part of the scheme.\nLast year, Lord Lloyd Webber said it was economically \"impossible\" to run theatres with social distancing.\nReacting to his latest comments, Greg Parmley, chief executive of live music trade association Live, said: \"The live music industry has spent months participating and paying for pilot events so we could reopen at full capacity safety.\n\"These events were a huge success and show, alongside every other international pilot, that with the right mitigations full capacity live events are safe.\n\"Despite this the government has refused to publish this data, forced us to remain closed and then tried to hand-pick a number of high profile events to go ahead whilst the rest of our industries are devastated.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Abertillery,Swansea,Morriston",
      "text": "Wedding businesses say there is \"no light at the end of the tunnel\" and are relying on personal savings to survive.\nCouples who have planned, cancelled, then re-planned their special day say they are hoping to say \"I do\" instead of \"what can I do?\" as lockdown eases.\nBut with no date set for wedding receptions, there remains confusion over whether plans for 2021 will fall foul of future guidelines.\nThe Welsh government said the law had changed to expand the range of venues.\nA week ago First Minister Mark Drakeford set out how various sectors in society would be reopened - like non-essential shops, hairdressers and outdoor sports - but weddings were not mentioned in his plans. \nOn Friday the Welsh government said as long as case rates remained low and vaccination numbers continued, weddings would be \"considered\" from 22 April.\nAt present receptions are banned and the number of ceremony guests depends on how many people from different households a venue can safely keep 2m apart.\nKris Agland, managing director of venue St Peter's Hall in Cardiff, said the guidance around weddings was \"being handled appallingly\" and called for more dialogue between the hospitality industry and those in power.\n\"There's no clear guidance. It's been a kind of one-size-fits-all approach,\" he said.\n\"Come and see what we're doing - do you feel safe? Why can't someone from the trade be part of their conversations?\"\nHe said he spent about \u00a310,000 making Covid-compliant additions to the venue, which usually hosts 50 to 60 wedding receptions each year.\n\"No-one will book anything until they know what the guidance is,\" he said.\n\"Everything is based on what-ifs. Financially as a business it's crippled it. Personally, it's just got me further and further into debt just like everybody else who owns hospitality businesses. \n\"When things do come back they're going to come back with such a boom that you've got to see yourselves through to that position. But at what stage do people say, 'well I can't see it through'?\"\nWedding photographer Mary Watler-Thomas, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said some ceremonies had been \"surreal\", including couples being told to wear masks during the ceremony.\n\"Last year I was set to cover 20 [weddings] but I had quite a few postponed so ended up doing 10. But this year I'm set to do 27, fingers crossed,\" she said.\n\"When people want to postpone they're worried they won't be able to have all their guests there, they want to postpone but I'm not available for their new date.\n\"Because they haven't given a date for hospitality [couples are] reducing the day to just the ceremony. I've had to reduce the time to two hours where I used to cover 12 hours so it's had a massive impact on income because you're reducing the day by 10 hours.\n\"There's been so much confusion... a lot of questions in the minds of those planning what it'll look like in Wales, so it would be very helpful to have a roadmap in Wales.\"\nClaire Vessey, 46, from Treboeth, Swansea, and her fianc\u00e9e David McQueen, 54, from Morriston, have been together for nine years and put off getting married while caring for Claire's elderly mum, Maureen.\nWhen Maureen, 86, died at the start of the first lockdown, the couple - who had previously had a blessing at the Sacred Heart church in Swansea - decided to make her dream come true.\n\"The wedding would be one thing she would want us to do,\" said Ms Vessey, an administration manager for fire protection services.\n\"Us being happy together, that's what she would have loved. \n\"We incorporated what she would want too, so we can feel like she's there. She loved butterflies so that's part of our theme. She's a massive part of the day.\"\nBut Covid restrictions meant the couple had to plan for various outcomes. They still have not confirmed their guest list.\n\"We booked it for 15 May. It has been so hard with all the restrictions and so many obstacles put in our way,\" said Ms Vessey.\n\"It's like we have been planning two weddings. One for original plans - church wedding with a late reception - and also back-up plans if restrictions do not lift, which is looking like what we will have to go with.\n\"But these plans are all still not confirmed. Everything is up in the air and the weeks are flying by - we never thought it would be so stressful.\"\nDespite the stress, the couple said there were benefits to keeping the wedding simple.\nMs Vessey said: \"When people planned weddings in the past, they planned this big wedding with all these people, but when you break it down it's about two people that really love each other. He's my first real boyfriend and my first love. \n\"It's about David and I now. We've concentrated on what's important for us two, which is what it's really about.\"\nIn Scotland, wedding receptions - but without alcohol - can take place with up to 50 people from 26 April.\nWedding ceremonies in Northern Ireland are currently limited to 25 people and receptions are banned. But dates for lockdown easing reviews are set for 15 April, 13 May and 10 June.\nFrom 29 March in England, weddings can be attended by a maximum of six people. This will rise to 15 after 12 April if Covid rates remain low, increasing to a limit of 30 after 17 May. Receptions are included in the plans, but only in certain venues.\nHelen Pembridge, who runs a bridal boutique in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, said many brides who had already had to cancel appointments three or four times were \"desperate\" to get dresses in case there was another lockdown.\n\"Brides I'm getting calls from are not even getting married until October 2022, but they want to get their dresses now because they're afraid they won't be able to if we have to shut again for a couple of months,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government has already set out different rules for weddings at different alert levels. \nAt alert level four, for instance, receptions are banned but at alert level two a maximum of 30 people can attend an indoors reception and 50 outdoors, and venues are still subject to any additional rules set at that time on hospitality.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We know many couples have made the difficult decision to postpone their wedding because of the ongoing pandemic.\n\"The current restrictions allow for the legal marriage ceremony to take place and we have changed the law to expand the range of venues where ceremonies can be performed.\n\"These are challenging times for everyone, especially those working in the events and hospitality sector, but with everyone's help, better times are ahead of us.\""

      "text": "As players \"take the knee\" before Friday's European championship game at Wembley in a stance against racism, few will realise Scotland was the first international side to field a black player. \nMore than 140 years ago Andrew Watson captained the Scots to a 6-1 victory against England, a record away win. \nBorn in Guyana in 1856, Watson came to Britain with his father who was a wealthy sugar planter.\nAs a student at Glasgow University, he played for a leading Glasgow club - Parkgrove FC, which was a rare example of racial diversity at the birth of the modern game.\nParkgrove, which played close to where Rangers' Ibrox Stadium is now, also featured another black player, Robert Walker and a goalkeeper who was half Chinese. \nWatson was one of its leading administrators, bankrolling the club thanks to a large inheritance on the death of his father.  \nRichard McBrearty, curator of the Scottish Football Museum, said Watson was a top star in the 1870s and 1880s.\n\"Wherever he went, he was box-office attraction. Everybody knew who he was,\" Mr McBrearty said.\n\"You can look at particularly iconic black football players in the 20th Century - and there are great players like Pel\u00e9. Within the 19th Century context Watson should be at that level.\"\nThere are no comments in contemporary reports on the colour of Watson's skin - merely a match report distinguishing him from the other players because he wore brown rather than the usual black boots.\nFootball writer Connor Heffanan said: \"Although it has made the historians' lives particularly difficult, the fact that Watson's skin colour seemed to be of no significance to his peers or the Scottish Football Association is in many ways a cause of celebration.\"\nPlaying for Queens Park, Watson was selected as one of five Spiders players in the Scotland team to play England at The Oval in March 1881, being named captain. \nThe Scots, playing a close passing game compared to England's concentration on individual dribbling, won 6-1 with Watson excelling at full back as the hosts fought back from losing an early goal. \nThe Field, reporting the match, said: \"Another throw-in on behalf of England brought about some sharp work in front of their opponents' fortress, which Watson put an end to with a capital kick.\"\nWatson was selected for Scotland's next two games against Wales, which they won 5-1 in Wrexham and against England in Glasgow in 1882, another 5-1 triumph. \nWatson was born on 24 May 1856, in British Guiana (now Guyana), the son of a sugar planter who was born in Orkney and a local woman. \nWhen Watson's father died in 1869, he and his sister Annetta each inherited a considerable amount.\nAfter school in England, Watson attended Glasgow University where he learned to play football.\nWhile playing for Queen's Park FC, he became club secretary and won the Scottish Cup in 1881, 1882 and 1886 - the first black player to win a major competition. \nHe went on to play for Scotland but his international career ended when he moved to London as the Scottish FA only selected home-based players in the late 19th Century. \nWatson played for a number of leading amateur sides in England before moving to Merseyside to train as a sea-going engineer.\nSigning for Bootle FC, who along with Everton were the leading Merseyside team at the time, he was the subject of an FA investigation over claims that he had been paid to play in a cup match. \nAlthough the allegations were thrown out, the suspicion has remained that he received wages and a signing-on fee as Bootle were known for paying several players.\nRichard McBrearty said there was mystery about the move from star player to merchant seaman, which perhaps indicated Watson had run out of money. \n\"The rules regarding professionalism were very strict, requiring people to have been resident for a period of time before they could become professional players,\" Mr McBrearty said. \n\"Watson had not lived long enough in Bootle to legally become a professional player. \n\"If he needed the additional income by this time, it opens up the question of whether or not he was secretly being paid, and that would have made him the earliest black professional.\"\nArthur Wharton, of whom a mural was unveiled in Darlington in 2020 has previously been regarded as the first black professional. \nProfessionalism existed in Scotland at the time, but in England the game remained officially amateur.\nThe Lancashire Evening Post commented: \"That several of the Bootle players have been brought over to play football and found situations is matter of common knowledge out Liverpool way and no doubt they have seen the last of cup-ties for some time to come.\" \nDespite this an FA inquiry threw out allegations that Bootle were paying Watson, leaving the question of whether he was a professional player unresolved.  \nWatson later retired from football and died in London on 8 March 1921. \nA headstone on his grave in Richmond Cemetery has been restored after a fundraising campaign. \nIn April 2021 a mural in Glasgow's Shawlands depicting Andrew Watson was vandalised with racist graffiti. \nThe then Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf, condemned the vandalism which he said spoke to the fact that racism still exists in Scotland.

      "text": "It's not the big day Blayne Pereira had planned. He'd been hoping to be at Wembley with his mates watching England play Scotland for the first time in a major tournament since 1996.  \nAnd until three weeks ago, there was still a chance he'd actually have a ticket for the big game. But like thousands of others, his ticket has now been refunded and he's had to make alternative plans. For Blayne, that means a day of wedding planning and visiting potential venues with his fianc\u00e9e.\n\"We've got three venues booked in,\" he says. \"It's a big difference from a day out with the lads.\"\nTickets for the match went on sale in the summer of 2019 - before it was known who would be playing. Blayne, 31, from north London, managed to buy a ticket for the second game at Wembley, only to see the tournament postponed because of Covid-19. \nThe draw for the tournament was then held in November 2019, when England were put into a group with Croatia, Czech Republic and a play-off winner.\nThe play-offs were postponed from March 2020 to November, which was when Scotland secured their place in the group.\nEarlier this year, it was announced the game would go ahead at Wembley a year late, but with a reduced capacity of just 25%, giving Blayne hope he would be one of the lucky ones to attend.\nBut three weeks ago, organisers Uefa emailed to say his ticket had been cancelled and refunded. Only 22,500 lucky fans will be able to attend, and his name hadn't been drawn out in the ballot. \n\"I was actually able to go to the England v Croatia game on Sunday,\" the England supporter says. \"That was pure luck. A friend's dad had to isolate ahead of an operation. I'd probably feel worse if I hadn't got (that chance) to go and experience the atmosphere.\"\nBlayne got engaged last month and is looking to get married in December 2022 - during what will be the Qatar World Cup. He had planned to watch Friday's game at a friend's barbecue but with bad weather expected, now he is not so sure. \n\"Whatever happens it will be something much more low key.\"\nAll the venues hosting the tournament are allowing fans to attend the matches.\nOfficials in St Petersburg and Baku recently confirmed capacities of 50%, with Budapest having a completely full stadium, but with strict entry requirements for spectators.\nAmsterdam, Bucharest, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Rome and Seville have been at between 25% and 33% of the stadium capacity, while Munich has admitted about 14,500 fans, so filling approximately 22% of its total seats.\nDublin and Bilbao had scheduled matches taken away from them, because they could not guarantee admitting spectators.\nLuke McEwen, 35, from west London, had a ticket to the England v Scotland game for the \"best part of two years\", he says. Three weeks ago, he got an email from Uefa at 04:00 BST informing him he'd been unsuccessful in the latest ballot. \nThe news was \"gutting\" and \"devastating\". For Luke, it was the only match he got in an initial ballot for tickets in 2019. He says it was \"perfect\" - a game to \"really look forward to\". \n\"We were only successful with one game in the ballot, the second group game,\" explains Luke. At the time, this also meant the possibility of England playing Israel, where his partner is from.\n\"So even though we didn't get every ticket we wanted, we thought this was perfect.\"\nIt was a \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity, he says. But instead, he's looking at the positive side of the situation. He'll be at a local pub where they have \"jazzed up their beer garden\" and are showing matches on a big screen. The ticket refund will cover his drinks.\n\"I'm just disappointed. I think as fans we've missed out on football for so long that we just want to get back into stadiums. I'm a Tottenham fan and was lucky enough to go to the Carabao Cup final a few weeks ago. We didn't win, but it was good to be there.\" \nJames Leighfield, a 26-year-old Manchester United fan, had a dream ticket to follow England all the way to the tournament's final - if they made it there - with tickets for every one of their potential matches.\nHowever, all of his tickets were cancelled and refunded. Unsuccessful in the fresh ballot, he nevertheless managed to get hold of a ticket to see Raheem Sterling's goal claim victory against Croatia on Sunday. But despite checking regularly, it doesn't look like he will be able to do the same for the Scotland game.\n\"I'm frustrated,\" he told the BBC.\n\"The FA has been working hard to get tickets, but the process has been frustrating, especially for those who are England Supporters Travel Club members.\nUnless there is a last-minute reprieve, he said he would be watching the Scotland game at home with friends.\n\"It's not ideal because it's too late to book anywhere with a decent atmosphere outside of your own home,\" he said.\n\"I've missed out on Scotland entirely, which is a once in a lifetime thing with the game being in England.\" "

      "text": "Planning a wedding has been a frustrating process for many since the first Covid lockdown in March last year.\nRules on outdoor wedding receptions now allow guest numbers to match concerts and sporting events.\nBut some in the wedding industry have branded the changes \"confusing\", while entertainers have been \"forgotten\".\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said numbers would be based on how many people can be safely accommodated.\nUnder new guidelines from Monday, there will be no limit on numbers at indoor weddings, but the figure has to be calculated following a risk assessment by venue staff.\nThirty people had previously been able to attend indoor wedding receptions.\nMr Drakeford said that rule had now been relaxed: \"At quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now.\"\nOther restrictions will remain however.\nGuests have to follow social distancing rules, including wearing face masks at indoor venues when not eating or drinking while seated.\nThe bride and groom do not have to wear masks when walking down the aisle, exchanging vows, or for their first kiss and first dance.\nThey are also able to remove them for indoor photographs just of themselves, but photos should be done outdoors where possible.\nOnly the bride and groom are allowed to take part in a first dance, and no other dancing is permitted.\nBackground music can be played at a low volume during the ceremony and the reception, but no singing or chanting is allowed.\nSpeeches can be made, but guidance issued states that microphones should not be shared and gifts should not be given out during speeches.\nStephanie Hobrow, 38, from Cowbridge in Vale of Glamorgan, has set a date for her wedding to fianc\u00e9 Matt Tomkins three times in the past year.\nShe also works with wedding venues as a marketing manager.\nShe said the Welsh government's update on wedding restrictions was \"slightly confusing again\".\n\"Wedding receptions that are outdoors have now been included in the numbers of 4,000 and 10,000 capacity. So, in theory, from Monday you can get married or have your wedding reception outside with unlimited amounts of guests.\n\"At the moment, work-wise, it's just a case of dealing with each bride and groom on a case-by-case basis, depending what they want to do. We've got some venues that have outside space, some that have only got inside space.\n\"Personally, I'm just sitting it out and waiting really. There's not a lot I can do now. We should have been last September, we then moved to April and now moved it to September.\n\"Dress is done, venue is done, flowers are done, band is done... it's just the evening part that's the uncertain bit at the moment.\n\"If there's the option to have possibly unlimited numbers now for a reception that's outside, I think people would be crazy to not explore that avenue.\"\nWedding DJ Matt Lane from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, said: \"When the first lockdown started, all my brides and grooms postponed, most of them for either later on in the year or 2021.\n\"But the further we get into this year, they're all postponing again and it just keeps getting pushed back. My last wedding was March 2020. I haven't done a wedding since, people don't want to go ahead with it because they can't have the numbers they want. \n\"At the moment you can only have background music, the bride and groom can get up for the first dance, then after that everyone else has to sit back down, so everything's moving to 2022 now.\n\"How long before people decide they're not going to do it and cancel altogether?\"\nHe added that the entertainment industry had been \"forgotten about\", while pubs and restaurants reopened.\n\"I've been able to get some of the grants available, but it's nothing compared to what I've lost - I've lost thousands, I'd usually do around 30 weddings a year,\" he said.\n\"As a wedding supplier we're basically forced to shut down. There should have been more help for entertainers.\"\nPaul Rees and Yvonne Inglis from Pontardawe, Neath Port Talbot, had excitedly booked a secret wedding venue for 9 July, to be followed by a big party with their loved ones and a luxury honeymoon abroad.\nBut after Covid \"rolled on and on\" and they both experienced health scares, they have scaled back their plans to have a \"registry office job\" in four weeks' time. And they couldn't be happier.\n\"I think what happened was Covid actually brought it home, we both had health issues and we sat down and said why don't we just do it?\" said Mr Rees. \n\"So we've decided on the registry office and then we're having a very small reception, just with our children. The restaurant is where next year's big party will be. \n\"For our plan B honeymoon - we had booked this fabulous all-inclusive in Turkey - we're doing three days in Windermere at this spa hotel right on the shores of Windermere and then we're going up to Edinburgh the rest of the week, where Yvonne is from, and it gives us the opportunity to see her family.\n\"Out of disaster we've kind of rescued it, so we're really excited. We had to look at it very pragmatically. Given that we'd both been ill we decided we are going to get married come what may.\n\"Both Yvonne and I had Covid just before Christmas. I was significantly worse than Yvonne, but we were both really really ill. At the same time, she had an issue where she was getting pains down one side and the first thing she thought was a heart issue. We had that investigated and it was nothing.\n\"I'm 63, Yvonne is 55. At our time of life, we'd both had health scares, there's nothing to say that won't happen again, so why don't we just get married?\"\nMr Drakeford said he could \"understand and sympathise\" with those planning a wedding about the continued limitations on indoor gatherings, but his decision was based on the science, which suggested the chances of catching coronavirus indoors was 15 to 20 times higher than in outdoor settings.\n\"The distinction that we have made all the way through with outdoors being better than indoors has now been confirmed from data from around the world,\" he told the coronavirus briefing on Friday.\nHe added that outdoor wedding receptions would be subjected to the same restrictions as other outdoor events and restrictions on numbers in indoor settings would be reviewed in the coming weeks."

      "text": "Politicians don't like saying sorry, and it's rare to hear.\nSo the justice secretary's decision to make a major public apology to all victims of rape is an unusual and important moment, acknowledging that the system has let countless victims down, and that the government's efforts to help them seek justice have failed.\nThe quickest of glances at the slide in the numbers of prosecutions and convictions for rape in England and Wales shows what's happened in the last few years - numbers at a record low, fewer than half the number of cases progressing compared to five years ago. \nAnd on Friday, what Robert Buckland described as the \"sobering\" review of how bad things have got will be published in full. \nHis verdict? \nThat the \"sheer scale\" of what's gone wrong has left far too many victims, chiefly women, \"without any means of redress\". \nQuite the admission from the man in charge of the legal system. \nHe certainly can't hide from the numbers, nor the experiences of the victims who, suffering not just the terrible misfortune of being attacked, all too often feel that their experience with the police, CPS or judicial system makes things worse. \nThe justice secretary will publish plans to try to improve the situation on Friday, including a target to return the level of cases taken to 2016 levels, for victims' phones to be returned much more quickly if they are taken for evidence gathering and to shift the focus away from victims' histories to perpetrators' behaviour.  \nBut he admitted that cuts to the justice system have been part of the problem saying, it was \"self-evidently the case that decisions were made\" that took money out of the system.\nBut Mr Buckland, himself a QC who prosecuted many of these kinds of cases, is trying to shift something more fundamental than finding enough cash from the Treasury or introducing new policies.\nHe is trying to push more than 45 different organisations - police forces, the judiciary, the CPS - to give rape more priority. \nHe wants to change the culture: the \"focus should be on predators, not whether victims should be believed\", he says. \nQuestioning why the terrible clich\u00e9s about sexual offence victims still pertain, he says: \"If your house is burgled people don't start asking you why you did you go out\u2026 all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences. \n\"It's not that long ago we lived in a climate where frankly for a woman who seen to be dressed in a certain way, there were terrible assumptions of consent,\" and he calls for those \"damaging misconceptions\" to be stamped out. \nCulture can't be changed overnight. \nAnd the government is only seeking to return the rates of prosecution to 2016 levels. \nSo while a new focus on seeking justice for rape may be welcome, there's a real question over whether the scale of ambition really matches the scale of the problem. Labour says the government's record is abysmal.  \nThe apology does matter, a political signal of priority, but campaigners and victims will want to see actual progress - it won't be a matter of forgive and forget."

It will return to the streets because it means too much not to.\n\"As with last year we will make sure carnival will be celebrated - it's not actually carnival because carnival is a street event and if it's not on the street it's not carnival - but it will be celebrated.\"\nThere will be some smaller events in the run-up to the bank holiday where the number of spectators can be limited and controlled, and there will also be online offerings.\nEmma Will from Kensington and Chelsea Council said that although the news was disappointing, the council \"completely supports\" the move. \n\"It is important that we look after the wellbeing of our residents and visitors. \n\"We are committed to supporting this celebration and making it as fun, magical and as safe as possible. We will be working with relevant partners such as the Met, TfL and more to ensure that this bank holiday weekend passes safely and the virtual carnival alternative is enjoyed.\"\nThe decision to take the event off the street follows the government's extension of Covid restrictions in England.\nIt had hoped to remove all legal limits on social contact from 21 June. That has been put back until 19 July.\nFull details of the carnival's alternative arrangements will be released nearer the time and the latest developments will be announced on social media and via its website."

But it really is every minute of every day, there some kind of worry going around my head at the moment.\n\"We don't know whether we go ahead and pay these suppliers, who within the next few weeks or so, are due the best part of six grand from us.\" \nCrug Gas Country House, near St David's in Pembrokeshire, usually it hosts about 60 weddings a year - but because of the Covid lockdown rules, there have been three this year so far.\n\"At weddings here it's table service-only and only the bride and groom are allowed to dance - it's really sad,\" Crug Glas' wedding coordinator Sandra Vaughan told BBC Radio Cymru.\n\"It's quite hard to see people out enjoying the football in the pubs, but nobody can come here to have a nice wedding. It's not the same product we sold to them.\"\nWelsh government officials are talking to councils about the possibility of fan zones for Wales' remaining Euro 2020 games, Mr Drakeford said. \nHundreds gathered at one indoor venue near Cardiff for Wales' 2-0 victory over Turkey, with hopes larger outdoor facilities will be opened.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford said conversations were taking place with experts and police about the viability of accommodating the \"large numbers of people\" fan zones would attract.\nThe announcement comes as Wales' overall case rate has continued to climb since late May. \nThere are close to 500 cases of the Delta variant, which originated in India, accounting for four out of every five new cases in Wales, latest figures show, with Mr Drakeford saying it is \"seeded in every part of Wales\".\nHe believes it could be a fortnight before the impact of this is seen in hospital admissions and people falling ill. \n\"Across the border in Scotland and England, they are about two weeks ahead of us on all of this,\" he added.\n\"We are already seeing hospital numbers rising, particularly amongst people in their forties and fifties. \n\"That's why we will use the next four weeks to accelerate or vaccination programme.\"\nMore than 500,000 doses of the Covid vaccine will be distributed across Wales in a bid to speed up the number of people receiving second jabs. So far 1,454,066 people have been fully vaccinated. \nMr Drakeford said restrictions could be eased following the four-week pause even if there is not conclusive evidence that vaccinations have broken the link between rising infections and hospital admissions.\nHe told the PA news agency: \"I agree that you cannot, in the end, delay everything in the search for perfection in terms of data.\n\"But what we are quite clearly told by our scientific advisers as well as others is that this four weeks will allow us to get a sufficiently good handle on the extent to which a relationship between falling ill and needing hospitalisation has been modified by the vaccine.\n\"Then we will make a calculation about how much headroom we have, as we always do, to take further steps.\"\nResponding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Many in hospitality are still feeling the pinch from the unexplained gap in funding in April of this year.\"\nHe said, while clarity on wedding venues would be welcome, he called on the Welsh government to \"provide leadership and support at a time when many have genuine fears for the future\".\nWelsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies wants the move to be scrutinised in the Welsh Parliament. \nHe added: \"In light of the ongoing restrictions, Welsh businesses will require more financial support and I hope the first minister makes clear what additional funding his government will provide to protect Welsh jobs.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The \"cultural package\" including Irish language laws have been at the heart of the Stormont stand-off and seemingly the row within the DUP.\nBut what was agreed on language and culture in the New Decade New Approach (NDNA) agreement?\nSome parts of that agreement have already quietly been enacted, like an Irish and Ulster-Scots language translation service for public bodies.\nThere will be also be simultaneous translation into Irish and Ulster-Scots in the assembly.\nBut the bulk of the NDNA measures are still to come into force.\nThere is, though, no new stand-alone Irish language act as the new legislation on language amends the existing Northern Ireland Act, 1998.\nAn \"Office of Identity and Cultural Expression\" is to be set up by the Executive Office under the NDNA plans.\nIt will be a statutory body and the First and Deputy First Minister, acting jointly, will appoint its director.\nIn many ways, they will be a kind of \"cultural ombudsman\" - guiding public bodies and monitoring how they provide services to users of minority languages.\nMore vaguely, they will also look at how \"cultural traditions and identities\" are being promoted and protected, as well as funding events, media, exhibitions and education projects.\nThere is no indication yet of how much money they will have to do that.\nThere will then be two further commissioners - an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner \"to enhance and develop the language, arts and literature associated with the Ulster Scots / Ulster British tradition in Northern Ireland\".\nThey will also be part of the Office of Identity and Cultural Expression and will also be appointed by the First and Deputy First Ministers.\nInterestingly, they can refer \"issues of a challenging nature\" to the director of the Office of Identity and Cultural Expression.\nNDNA does not define what those issues might be though.\nThe Irish language commissioner's main role is to advise and set standards for public bodies on how they use Irish, and investigate complaints when those bodies fall short of services to Irish speakers.\nHowever, any recommendations the commissioner makes have to be approved by the first and deputy first minister.\nFor instance, if they recommended that all motorway signs should be in English and Irish the First and Deputy First Minister would both have to agree.\nThat has led some Irish language speakers fearing they could face \"a battle a day\" to get services in the language.\nNDNA also commits to the repeal of an act dating from 1737, which bans the use of Irish in courts.\nThat will enable Irish to be used in court, and births, deaths and marriages to be registered in Irish.\nThe role of the commissioner to enhance \"the Ulster Scots / Ulster British tradition\" is a little different to their Irish language counterpart.\nWhile they too will provide advice and guidance to public bodies on services in Ulster-Scots - and investigate complaints - they do not set \"best practice standards\" for public bodies in the way the Irish commissioner does.\nTheir remit also includes \"education, research, media, cultural activities and facilities and tourism initiatives\" but no detail is given in NDNA on what their role is in these areas.\nHowever, NDNA makes clear that there will be no employment quotas for speakers of any language.\nThat means a public body does not have to commit to having a certain percentage of employees as Irish or Ulster-Scots speakers.\nThere are also some language measures already in existence which are nothing to do with the NDNA agreement.\nBilingual street signs are perhaps the most visible.\nPolicy on those is already the responsibility of Northern Ireland's eleven councils."

We will also put greater resources into ensuring a bigger role for women and black members in the union and greater support in the workplace,\" they say.\nThe statement also suggests that Ms Graham would be an important member of Mr Turner's team too, were he to win.\nGerard Coyne was narrowly defeated for the top post of general secretary by Mr McCluskey in 2017, and he is seen as the candidate closest to the Labour leadership under Sir Keir Starmer.\nEfforts had been under way to agree a single candidate from the left to take him on in the contest.\nThe Labour leadership will be relieved that Howard Beckett is out of the running.\nBut Mr Beckett was also under huge pressure to step aside from many on the Left - not least Len McCluskey. \nThe outgoing Unite boss hosted a series of \"behind-closed-doors\" negotiations with the three Left candidates - Steve Turner, Sharon Graham and Mr Beckett.\nHe believed a \"split vote\" on the Left would give his former opponent for the top Unite post, Gerard Coyne, a much better chance of victory.\nRead Iain's full analysis\nIn a statement, Mr Coyne said Mr Beckett's decision to pull out of the race and endorse Steve Turner is an attempt to prevent cultural change at Unite.\nHe said he was \"happy to be the mainstream candidate\". \nHe added: \"I am the only candidate who would change the culture of the union, make its financial affairs transparent, improve its internal democracy and end the ill-judged attempts to drive the Labour Party from the back seat. \n\"Previously, I was up against three full time officers of Unite who represented continuity and were opposed to change.

      "tags": "Companies,UK economy,Brexit",
      "text": "UK food and drink exports to the European Union almost halved in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2020. \nThe Food and Drink Federation (FDF) figures show EU sales dropped by 47%.\nThe trade body said the decline was largely due to changes in the UK's trading relationships, but said the pandemic was also a factor.\nThe government said it was \"too early to draw any firm conclusions\" on the long term impact of Brexit.\nIt also said the pandemic had depressed demand.\n\"The most recent ONS trade statistics show that for both March and April, overall exports to the EU have exceeded the average levels across 2020,\" a government spokesperson added.\nRachel Hicks, co-founder and co-distiller at Sky Wave Gin said the \"red tape is strangling\" her business. She said that EU sales \"utterly dropped off a cliff\" in the first quarter, meaning her turnover was down 30%. \n\"The real shame is somewhere like Asia - a fast growing region for gin - is going to potentially snaffle all the markets,\" Ms Hicks said.\n\"We are now unable to quickly send gin to our customers all over Europe and have to wait for HMRC to inspect us every time we send gin abroad.\"  \nGraham Flannigan from Berwick Shellfish in Northumberland, is in a similar position. He said his seafood exports had \"come down drastically\" mainly due to Brexit and the impact of lockdowns.\n\"The logistics systems are moving better now but it's the red tape that is having to be built into the cost of the goods and this is having a knock on effect,\" he added. \nDominic Goudie, the FDF's head of international trade, said the drop in exports his federation had recorded was a \"disaster\" for the industry.\n\"It is a very clear indication of the scale of losses that UK manufacturers face in the longer-term due to new trade barriers with the EU.\"\nNew trade barriers were not the only factor affecting cross channel trade. The FDF said that the Covid-19 outbreak accounted for a decline of some 10-15%. \nFigures for the quarter were also affected by companies stockpiling ahead of the Brexit-related changes. \nThe combination of these factors, the FDF says, led to significant falls in the value of leading exports. \nCompared with the first quarter of 2019 - before Covid became a factor - exports of cheese were down 72%; fish sales were down 52% and chocolate was down 37%.\nExports of food and drink to nearly all EU nations fell significantly in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year.\nWorst hit was trade with Ireland - normally the sector's biggest overseas market. It was down by more than 70%. But sales to Germany, Spain and Italy also more than halved.\nFor decades, the UK has sold more food and drink to the European Union than to the rest of the world combined. \nHowever, the fall in shipments to Europe means that is no longer the case. In the first quarter exports to non-EU nations made up 55% of the total.\nThe FDF said this is the first time this has happened in at least 20 years. \nOverall, sales to non-EU countries rose by 0.3% - although there was a significant increase in shipments to China.\nSales to the region, which fell in the first quarter of last year due to Covid-related lockdowns, recovered to reach \u00a3200m - well above their pre-pandemic level of \u00a3163m.\nOn 31 December, the so-called 'implementation period', in place since Britain left the EU, came to an end.\nThat meant trade across the channel became subject to new post-Brexit regulations and customs formalities for the first time. \nThis FDF says this has had a particularly significant impact on the trade in products of animal origin and other perishable foods, because it led to significant delays while formalities were completed.\n\"Trade that would take 12 hours in the past can now take a day or even a week,\" said Mr Goudie.\n\"If you lose two days or even three days it takes a big chunk out of the of shelf life of the product, which makes the trade itself less viable.\""

      "tags": "Galston,Wembley Stadium,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of Scotland fans have gathered in central London to watch the team's Euro 2020 match with England.\nMany fans travelled despite warnings they should not go to London unless they have a match ticket, or a safe place to watch the game.\nThose who gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police shortly after half-time.\nThe Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. The final score was 0-0.\nA fan zone in Trafalgar Square was reserved for 750 key workers.\nGroups of supporters wearing kilts, Scotland shirts and flags have been chanting, singing and playing bagpipes gathered at Leicester Square, King's Cross and Hyde Park.\nA large number of officers moved in on Scotland fans congregated in Leicester Square shortly before half time, after it is understood an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans who remained at the central London location after kick off. \nOfficers moved in and placed a cordon around the group of Scots who were later moved out of the square. \nEarlier a dispersal order was issued for central London, giving the police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress.\nThere have been no reports of any significant disorder - although there have been videos on social media that appeared to show some fans singing offensive anti-English songs.\nEstimates that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel south for the match have been been described as \"very conservative\" by a London Assembly member.\nAhead of the match, fans gathered in Leicester Square wearing kilts and Scotland shirts waved flags and set off blue smoke bombs while chanting, singing and playing the bagpipes.\nSome England fans were also seen in the square wearing team shirts and draped in England's flag.\nPeople were seen climbing into the fountain of William Shakespeare in the square and splashing around in the water. Others climbed on top of the statue and put a cone on its head.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged fans to \"be respectful to our hosts\" in London, and said they should not behave in a way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. \nShe also said she would \"abhor and condemn unreservedly\" any anti-English behaviour.\nAli Brawley, 55, from Galston in East Ayrshire, said he had arrived with a group of friends in London at midnight on Wednesday, and had spent the time since \"sightseeing\" around the city's pubs.\nMr Brawley and his friends will be watching the game from a pub which they booked, but he believes it would have been easier for fans - and the police - if there had been a dedicated fan zone for the Tartan Army.\nHe added: \"We had our first train cancelled, our hotel closed last week for refurbishment - we had to rebook the hotel. We just thought we weren't getting to get here. \n\"The organisation has been horrendous because of Covid, it's been tough to try and get somewhere to watch the football. \n\"I do believe they should have had big screens, herd us all together so we're all in the one place but now all the Scots are going to be everywhere.\"\nScotland fan Michael McLean, from Inverness, told BBC Scotland he had decided to travel after booking travel and accommodation several months ago.\n\"It's an amazing atmosphere so far. I think it seems that they've underestimated how many would travel down for the game,\" he said.\n\"It feels like a normal football occasion. It doesn't feel like there's a pandemic on, which I don't think is good in a way, but it's definitely good to enjoy an occasion after a year-and-a-half.\"\nMr McLean said the trains had been packed on the way down, with crowds of Scottish fans gathering and chanting outside King's Cross station on Thursday afternoon.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime he had heard London Mayor Sadiq Khan's pleas for fans to stay away, but said much of the travel he had booked was non-refundable.\n\"\u00a3600 in total for all of us would be a lot to lose just to decide not to go down. Fair enough if it was refundable - but I don't want to lose the money.\"\nOne Scot who lives in London said it was \"inevitable\" that crowds of fans would travel south. \nGary, a 30-year-old consultant, said: \"It was inevitable, regardless of restrictions in place. You can't stop the masses coming down to celebrate a once in a generation event.\"\nOf the Scotland-England rivalry, he added that \"99%\" would be friendly. \"It'll be a laugh,\" he said. \nThe Met Police's football chief, Ch Insp Joseph Stokoe, said officers had been reminding fans that some Londoners are \"still living under the fear of the pandemic\". \nHe added: \"It's a shame, it feels like there aren't enough places for the fans to enjoy themselves, but that's why the message has always been - if you don't have a ticket, don't travel.\n\"Enjoy the match, enjoy the event locally, in a safer event. Don't come here, because unfortunately because of what's gone on across the world, we've been unable to provide the amount of fan zones you might expect in normal times.\"\nEmma Best, a member of the London Assembly and the Conservative group's spokeswoman on health, said she believed an estimate that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel might turn out to be a \"very conservative\" estimate.\nBut Ms Best added that the Tartan Army had been creating a \"really good-natured atmosphere\" throughout the city.\n\"The Boogie song is being played everywhere I've been walking. It's a lovely atmosphere and you could be forgiven for thinking we are not still in the midst of a pandemic, and I think that sums it up.\n\"What a shame that we can't have this match in normal times and really enjoy this occasion, but we are where we are and I do hope it's as safe as it can be.\"\nWembley is open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry.\nPubs and bars in London were also expected to limit numbers allowed in.\nThe much-anticipated match, the 115th in international football's oldest rivalry, is the first time the two sides have met in a major tournament since Euro 96, when Paul Gascoigne's famous goal sealed a 2-0 win for England.\nScotland lost their first game of the tournament 2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday, while England defeated Croatia 1-0 the previous day.\nWembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic.\nScotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. \nAfter the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil.\nWhere are you watching the Euros this evening?

      "text": "Twenty-two people murdered in the Manchester Arena bomb were \"failed on every level\" by organisations criticised in a public inquiry report, a victim's father has said.\nBomber Salman Abedi should have been identified as a threat by security, the inquiry chairman said.   \nSir John Saunders found there were missed opportunities to avert or minimise the \"devastating impact\".\nMartyn Hett's father said the attack \"should have been prevented\".\nPaul Hett, whose 29-year-old son died in the bombing, said it had been heartbreaking \"to find that Martyn had just been in the wrong place at the wrong time\".\nIn addition to those who died, hundreds more were injured when the Manchester-born bomber, who was of Libyan descent, walked across the arena's foyer at the end of an Ariana Grande concert and detonated a device at 22:31 BST on 22 May 2017. \nThe first of three reports published by the public inquiry, which began in September, levelled criticism at British Transport Police (BTP), the arena operators SMG, and their contracted security providers, Showsec. \nMr Hett said the organisations involved had a duty of care to protect his son and the other victims, adding: \"This inquiry has rightly found that we were failed by them on every level.\" \n\"This atrocity should and could have been prevented, and 22 people would not have lost their lives,\" he said. \nSir John said it was likely Abedi would have detonated his device if confronted but \"the loss of life and injury is highly likely to have been less\".\nOn the night of the bombing the national terror threat was classed as severe, meaning an attack was highly likely.\nThe inquiry chairman said: \"Whilst the threat was not specific to any particular premises, the arena was always a possible target for a terrorist.\n\"Everybody concerned with security at the arena should have been doing their job in the knowledge that a terrorist attack might occur on that night. \n\"They weren't. No-one believed it could happen to them.\"\nSir John found two teenage stewards did not react \"as robustly and effectively as they should have\" when a member of the public, Christopher Wild, raised his concerns about the bomber. \nThe inquiry chairman called this \"the most striking missed opportunity\". \nOther key findings:\nA range of improvements have been recommended. \nMost notably Sir John has supported the introduction of new \"Protect Duty\" legislation to place a duty on venue operators to consider and cater for the risk of a terrorist attack. \nFigen Murray has been campaigning for the legislation, also known an \"Martyn's Law\", in memory of her son, Martyn Hett.\nShe said the report made it clear that \"venue security needs to be improved to help prevent further terror attacks\". \n\"We should not have to live in fear and I am determined to make this law a reality,\" she added. \nThis report makes difficult reading for the families of the 22 people who were murdered at the Manchester Arena.\nBut everyone I have spoken to has said how important it is, and how valuable they find it. \nNothing in the 200-page document can bring their loved ones back but there is a united feeling they do not want anyone else to suffer as they have.\nAnd so, they are committed to this inquiry laying out failures and suggesting ways to improve things for the future. \nThe families I have spoken to know that there is still a long road ahead and are particularly dreading the section of the inquiry which will examine how the 22 died and whether any of them could have been saved. \nThey know that there will be many more painful days like this one before they reach the end of the process. \nJune Tron, mother of 32-year-old Philip Tron from Gateshead, said she hoped laws would be introduced \"to ensure people can go to a concert or a big public event in confidence that they have the best possible protection\".  \n\"It has become clear that was not the case for Philip, 21 others who also lost their lives, and the hundreds more who were seriously injured or left traumatised by what happened,\" she said.\nShe said it was hard to accept that \"Philip and everybody else in the vicinity of the arena that night was placed at risk\". \nSolicitor Neil Hudgell, who represents some of the bereaved families, said collective failings made the arena a sitting target for terrorists, leaving thousands of young people \"open and vulnerable\".\n\"The security around the venue and event was nowhere near what it needed to be,\" he said. \nSpeaking on behalf of seven bereaved families, lawyer Elkan Abrahamson said: \"It has been incredibly disappointing for our families to watch and listen as those with responsibility for the safety of their loved ones failed to accept serious shortcomings and inadequacies in the security arrangements and sought to avoid responsibility and push the blame on to others.\" \nHe added: \"Prosecutions should be commenced without further delay.\"\nArena operator SMG said it would \"continuously challenge ourselves to be better\". \nSMG added that, during the inquiry, experts \"did not see evidence that the security operation in place at Manchester Arena was out of step with the operations being used at other comparable venues\" but added that \"this doesn't give us any comfort\". \n\"Our guests came to the arena to enjoy a show but were met with a horrific tragedy. For that we are truly sorry,\" a spokesperson added. \nSecurity firm Showsec said it had \"learnt lessons\" and improvements were \"already in place\" but it would now \"take time to consider both Sir John's criticisms and his recommendations before responding as he has requested\". \nBTP Chief Constable Lucy D'Orsi said the force had been \"reviewing procedures, operational planning and training\" since the attack and was \"committed to ensuring our staff are supported and prepared to undertake the roles they are required to do\".  \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the government continued \"to take action in response to the terrorist threat\" and had launched a consultation on the proposed Protect Duty.\nShe said the government would \"carefully consider\" the report and would respond fully in due course. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Rules covering wedding and civil partnerships receptions and wakes in Wales are to change from Monday.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said there would no longer be limits on numbers at weddings.\nFollowing a risk assessment by venues, numbers will be based on how many can be \"safely accommodated,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford also announced a four-week pause to further lifting of lockdown rules amid concerns over the Delta variant.\n\"We are once again facing a serious public health situation,\" he said.\nAt a briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford also warned a third wave of coronavirus has already started to spread widely across Wales.\nCurrently, as many people as a venue can accommodate safely can attend wedding ceremonies, but only 30 people can attend indoor wedding receptions. \nThere are other rules, such as the first dance must only involve the bride and groom.\nMr Drakeford said changes meant venues would move away from having a notional number, adding: \"If those can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do.\"\nHe added it would mean \"at quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now\".\nAmong the \"small technical amendments\" being made to the lockdown rules are:\nLockdown rules in Wales will be reviewed again on 15 July.\nLewys Williams and Ms Harris were supposed to get married in August of last year but have had to reschedule twice.\nOn one occasion this was because their venue was being turned into a mass vaccination centre.\nIn a letter, also signed by brides-to-be other than Ms Harris and some wedding suppliers, the couple ask Mr Drakeford for a roadmap for weddings. \nAnd they have asked if lateral flow tests could be given to guests before they arrive.\n\"We need clarity,\" Ms Harris said.\n\"We need a roadmap and we need to consider why on earth we are allowing sporting events of up to 10,000 people to go ahead, when we can't have our closest family and friends at our wedding.\n\"The level of worry, anxiety, mental health worries that this has caused.\n\"It sounds dramatic. But it really is every minute of every day, there some kind of worry going around my head at the moment.\n\"We don't know whether we go ahead and pay these suppliers, who within the next few weeks or so, are due the best part of six grand from us.\" \nCrug Gas Country House, near St David's in Pembrokeshire, usually it hosts about 60 weddings a year - but because of the Covid lockdown rules, there have been three this year so far.\n\"At weddings here it's table service-only and only the bride and groom are allowed to dance - it's really sad,\" Crug Glas' wedding coordinator Sandra Vaughan told BBC Radio Cymru.\n\"It's quite hard to see people out enjoying the football in the pubs, but nobody can come here to have a nice wedding. It's not the same product we sold to them.\"\nWelsh government officials are talking to councils about the possibility of fan zones for Wales' remaining Euro 2020 games, Mr Drakeford said. \nHundreds gathered at one indoor venue near Cardiff for Wales' 2-0 victory over Turkey, with hopes larger outdoor facilities will be opened.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford said conversations were taking place with experts and police about the viability of accommodating the \"large numbers of people\" fan zones would attract.\nThe announcement comes as Wales' overall case rate has continued to climb since late May. \nThere are close to 500 cases of the Delta variant, which originated in India, accounting for four out of every five new cases in Wales, latest figures show, with Mr Drakeford saying it is \"seeded in every part of Wales\".\nHe believes it could be a fortnight before the impact of this is seen in hospital admissions and people falling ill. \n\"Across the border in Scotland and England, they are about two weeks ahead of us on all of this,\" he added.\n\"We are already seeing hospital numbers rising, particularly amongst people in their forties and fifties. \n\"That's why we will use the next four weeks to accelerate or vaccination programme.\"\nMore than 500,000 doses of the Covid vaccine will be distributed across Wales in a bid to speed up the number of people receiving second jabs. So far 1,454,066 people have been fully vaccinated. \nMr Drakeford said restrictions could be eased following the four-week pause even if there is not conclusive evidence that vaccinations have broken the link between rising infections and hospital admissions.\nHe told the PA news agency: \"I agree that you cannot, in the end, delay everything in the search for perfection in terms of data.\n\"But what we are quite clearly told by our scientific advisers as well as others is that this four weeks will allow us to get a sufficiently good handle on the extent to which a relationship between falling ill and needing hospitalisation has been modified by the vaccine.\n\"Then we will make a calculation about how much headroom we have, as we always do, to take further steps.\"\nResponding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Many in hospitality are still feeling the pinch from the unexplained gap in funding in April of this year.\"\nHe said, while clarity on wedding venues would be welcome, he called on the Welsh government to \"provide leadership and support at a time when many have genuine fears for the future\".\nWelsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies wants the move to be scrutinised in the Welsh Parliament. \nHe added: \"In light of the ongoing restrictions, Welsh businesses will require more financial support and I hope the first minister makes clear what additional funding his government will provide to protect Welsh jobs.\""

      "tags": "Northern Ireland Assembly,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Edwin Poots has resigned as DUP leader after just 21 days in the job following an internal party revolt.\nHe had been elected in the first leadership contest in the DUP's 50-year history, with predecessors chosen by the party's top ranks.\nSo what went so wrong, so quickly, for the party's shortest-serving leader?\nEdwin Poots was under huge pressure having agreed a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in and the Westminster government to ensure Paul Givan became Northern Ireland's first minister.\nThis move was voted against by most of his elected colleagues.\nMr Poots, who took over as leader from Arlene Foster in May, had narrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson in a leadership vote.\nThe ousting of Mrs Foster was decisive, and also strikingly brutal. \nOn 28 April 2021, the former DUP leader resigned within 24 hours of it being widely leaked to the media that a significant number of elected representatives had signed a letter of no confidence.\nFormer party leader Peter Robinson branded the manner of the heave, which was instigated by Mr Poots' supporters, as \"publicly humiliating, vindictive and needlessly nasty\". \nThat view was shared by a great number of DUP members - some of whom had their own issues with Mrs Foster's leadership, but who nevertheless believed she should have been treated with more respect.\nMrs Foster shared her thoughts about the nature of her ousting with the BBC's Newscast programme.\n\"I think I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards, it was pretty brutal,\" she said.\nOn Thursday, Mrs Foster enjoyed a spot of lunch with a friend as the DUP party squabbled over the leadership of the party. \nIn a tweet, she said \"I hope everyone is having a nice day\".\nMr Poots' selection of a ministerial team was always going to be a balancing act.\nHe had to reward those who backed him, but many believe he also needed to conciliate those who were unhappy with his election.\nWhile he did ultimately appoint a few supporters of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to lower level assembly roles, the vast majority of posts were given to his own supporters.\nThe reaction to this was summed up by two ministers sacked by Poots, with Diane Dodds and Peter Weir both accusing him of failing to sufficiently reach out.\nMrs Dodds said it was \"regrettable\" the new team did \"not match the rhetoric about healing and bringing the party together\".\nSignificantly, there was no move to bring Sir Jeffrey into a prominent role in the Poots' camp after a closely fought leadership election. \nThe policy stance that ultimately undid the politician was the one he took on Irish language.\nMr Poots' insisted on pressing ahead with the nomination of his close friend Paul Givan as Stormont's first minister, despite opposition from a majority of his elected representatives who were deeply unhappy. \nThe vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots' decision during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting.\nSinn F\u00e9in had made clear it would only re-nominate Ms O'Neill if the party secured a guarantee that language legislation agreed in the New Decade New Approach Deal in 2020, that restored power-sharing, would be implemented.\nA refusal by Sinn F\u00e9in to nominate would have crashed the NI Executive and prompted a snap election.\nMr Poots said he would implement the legislation, but did not assure Sinn F\u00e9in he would do it in the current assembly mandate. \nIn response, Sinn F\u00e9in asked the UK government to introduce the laws at Westminster instead. \nIn the early hours of 17 June, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis not only agreed to Sinn F\u00e9in's request, but also announced Mr Poots was happy to proceed with reconstituting the NI Executive on that basis.\nThis move came as a shock to many within the DUP ranks and culminated in the decisive meeting at DUP party headquarters in east Belfast the following evening, after which Mr Poots resigned.\nSir Jefferey Donaldson has been tipped as the clear frontrunner for the leadership of the party, as well as some suggestions that East Antrim MP and long-standing DUP stalwart Sammy Wilson could be in the running.\nThe Lagan Valley MP narrowly missed out in the last leadership contest to Edwin Poots by just two votes on 14 May.\nA big question for the DUP in the short term is just how quickly Edwin Poots can feasibly be replaced as leader.\nIt is likely party officers will outline the timetable for that process, proposing a cut-off date for anyone interested in the position, which could be as soon as next week.\nAfter passing that stage, the party will then assess who is in the running for the leadership, and then decide how that is going to be ratified or rubber-stamped.\nThe party has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons recently, and the DUP will understandably want to move on from this difficult period as soon as possible. \nNewly elected First Minister Paul Givan finds himself in an uncomfortable position. \nThe very man who placed him there a day ago has been unceremoniously dumped from his leadership role by the party.\nWhoever takes on the leadership position will need to make a decision on how best to handle the first minister conundrum. \nUnless Paul Givan resigns from his post he will remain as first minister. \nIf he was to resign, it would then trigger a seven-day count down for another first minister to be appointed.\nFailure to do that, will result in Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis calling an election.\nSome within the party believe Sir Jeffrey Donaldson could help bring stability back to the party.\nSir Jeffrey may see Mr Givan remaining on in the first minister post as the best way to steady the ship.

      "tags": "Wembley Stadium,Peterhead",
      "text": "Thousands of Scotland fans are heading south ahead of the team's game against England on Friday night. \nTrain operators said many services were sold out to fans travelling to London for the Euro 2020 match at Wembley.\nWith tickets limited due to Covid restrictions, fans have been urged not to travel unless they have organised a place to watch the game.\nHowever, some supporters groups have criticised the tournament organisers for not setting up a fan zone.\nPaul Goodwin, founder of the Scottish Football Supporters' Association told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"So many Scotland fans are just so excited about the prospect.\n\"All these other [Covid] considerations that we've got, I think they are mindful of it. Undoubtedly it's not going to be same as normal.\n\"But I'm really disappointed that there isn't going to be a fan zone there, in a city the size of London.\"\nLoyal Tartan Army footsoldier Paul has chosen not to travel down for the match on this occasion - but he said it was inevitable that thousands of others would.\nHe said: \"In some respects, this is the most important fixture in Scottish football because of the historical consequences and the fact that it doesn't come around all that often.\n\"I think it's just a unique part of the super-loyalty that football fans have. They feel they have to be part of it.\n\"We can't go out and kick a ball on the park, but we can be part of that unique aspect that the Tartan Army brings.\"\nBy BBC Scotland's Steven Godden, in London\nFor Scotland fans games don't come bigger than England at Wembley. Tickets or no tickets, the thousands who've travelled weren't about to miss it. \nThe journey has been a mixture of planes, trains and automobiles. The London Mayor was among those asking fans not to travel unless they have somewhere safe to watch the game. \nAnd so, behind their masks on the morning flight from Edinburgh, kilted supporters were working out their plans for bar bookings. \nAt Kings Cross station, meanwhile, the swollen crowds underneath the old clock signalled the arrival of another train from Scotland. \nEvery time it was the cue for a quick, enthusiastic rattle through the Tartan Army songbook - \"Super John McGinn\" a particular favourite - before fans started to spread out across the pubs and parks of London. \nWith the traditional gathering point Trafalgar Square off limits, Leicester Square seems like a popular alternative this evening.\nHundreds of fans have gathered there. They're loud, well oiled and it didn't take long for the first one to find his way into the fountain. \nScotland lost their first game 2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday.\nWembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic.\nScotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. \nAfter the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil.\nTicketless fans have been urged not to travel to London unless they have organised somewhere to watch the match because space to congregate will be limited. \nWembley will be open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry.\nAnd Scotland fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square meeting place as it will be reserved as a fan zone for key workers.\nPubs and bars in London are also expected to limit numbers allowed in.\nHamish Husband, from the Association of Tartan Army Clubs, said it was \"a bit late\" to tell fans not to travel without a place to watch the match because the minute people knew Scotland were playing England, they had booked to go.\nMr Husband told BBC Scotland's the Nine there should have been more Covid-safe outdoor events offered for fans wanting to go to London. \"It's a no win situation,\" he added. \nHe said his plea to football fans was that they must \"follow the guidelines.\"\n\"If you're going to go down - and they are on their way - just, behave yourselves,\" he said.\nMany supporters have chosen to travel down early for the match.\nLNER, which operates the services from Edinburgh to London's Kings Cross, said its services were sold out for both Thursday and Friday. \nIt said its services were reservation only, and urged customers to only travel to the station if they already had a booking. \nAvanti West Coast, which operates the Glasgow to London line, said capacity on services had been reduced to about 40% due to social distancing. \nA spokesman said: \"We're monitoring demand closely and also looking at extra trains before and after the match.\n\"We're also reminding customers to travel safely by wearing a face covering unless they're exempt as well as strongly urging fans to plan ahead and only travel if they have a reservation.\"\nOn Thursday, a piper will play for queuing fans heading to London from Glasgow's Central Station. \nBritish Transport Police said extra officers would be on duty.  \nBTP's Supt Ricky Twyford said: \"Throughout Euro 2020, we'll have more officers at key stations and routes supporting fans, frontline rail staff and everyone else travelling during this busy time.\n\"In the lead up to and day of the England v Scotland game, there'll be an even further increase in officers, and we'll be working closely with Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police to ensure people's journeys are safe and secure, and disruption is kept to a minimum.\"\nLNER services are currently alcohol free, but customers will be able to drink onboard Avanti services. \nOn Wednesday night, one dedicated group of 25 or so football fans who managed to get tickets set off for Wembley from the north east. \nThey have hired a bus to - safely, and following social distancing rules - take them down to London. \nAmong them was Kev Lynch, 36, who told BBC Scotland he'd been away with the Tartan Army quite a few times - but this would be their first time since the pandemic began. \n\"Because of the restrictions, a lot of the boys didn't get tickets - we'd usually have had 50+ in normal times. \n\"It's the biggest game we've had in a long time.\" \nHe said the excitement on Friday night would be even more intense, after Scotland \"slipped up\" by being defeated by the Czech side on Monday. \n\"It will be the biggest game I have been to\" since the early 2000s, he said. \"The last time Scotland got to major finals I was still in secondary school.\n\"The fact it's England makes it a double bonus - the auld enemy,\" adding that it would make a victory \"even sweeter\". \nThe group will be joined later by more fans, who are flying down to join them. \nBecause the group of about 40 have been unable to book into the same pub, they have hired a boat on the Thames to watch earlier coverage, before heading to Wembley for the Scotland match.  \nKev said the bus journey home would be brilliant if Scotland win - but added: \"If there's a loss, it will be a long way home.\". \nAre you watching the Scotland-England game?

      "tags": "Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Robert Buckland",
      "text": "Ministers have said they feel \"deeply ashamed\" of low conviction rates for rape cases in England and Wales.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to victims and promised to \"do a lot better\".\nHe also admitted budget cuts were partly to blame for convictions falling to a record low in recent years.\nThe government says it is now considering allowing victims to pre-record their evidence to spare them the trauma of a courtroom trial.\nIts review also outlined plans to focus more on the suspect's behaviour - not the accuser's, and make sure phones taken away for evidence-gathering were returned within a day.\nThe review was met with mixed responses, with one rape charity saying it was a missed opportunity and failed to identify any big commitments that would radically and swiftly improve rape victims' experience.\nLabour said the government had \"failed victims of rape on every front\" and its recommendations did not go far enough.\nSpeaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Buckland said the report revealed \"at all stages of the criminal justice process frankly a failure to deal with complaints made by many thousands of victims\".\n\"The first thing I think I need to say is, sorry - it's not good enough.\"\nIn a foreword to the review, Mr Buckland, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Attorney General Michael Ellis, said: \"The vast majority of victims do not see the crime against them charged and reach a court - one in two victims withdraw from rape investigations.\n\"These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed,\" they wrote. \"Victims of rape are being failed.\"\nThey went on to say that most rapes were carried out by people known to the victim, making investigations very personal and intrusive for the victim. \nThe trauma and their experience afterwards led many to disengage from the criminal justice process, they said.\n\"We are not prepared to accept that rape is just 'too difficult' a crime to prosecute. We can, and must, do better,\" they added.\nKatherine Araniello says she felt she wanted to take her own life after her rape case was dropped \"practically on the eve of the trial\" by the Crown Prosecution Service.  \nShe says she was given an explanation as to why her case was dropped but it was only \"very vague\". \"They didn't call me in to iron out any issues they might have at their end.\"\nShe says she felt like \"it was my character\" the Crown Prosecution Service were judging, not that of the alleged perpetrator, and her treatment by the CPS \"really stung, and it still stings to this day\". \n\"That lack of acknowledgment from the CPS on how to treat victims, highly traumatised victims as well, has left me really angry with the system,\" she says.\n\"They haven't learned their lessons.\"\nEach year there are about 128,000 victims of rape and attempted rape but fewer than 20% of them report the crime to the police, according to the report. And just 1.6% of rapes result in someone being charged.\nEmily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and herself a rape victim, said the low prosecution rate was not because people made false allegations. \nShe cited Home Office research showing up to 3% of rape allegations could be false, which meant 97% of them were not.\n\"The reality is, in almost all cases, if someone says they've been raped, they have not made it up which makes the current situation all the more shocking and unacceptable,\" she said in the report.\nPlans set out in the report include:\nThe report - commissioned in March 2019 - also said the volume of cases going to court should return to \"at least 2016 levels\" and that regular \"scorecards\" would be published to monitor progress.\nThe Law Commission will also begin a review into \"rape myths\" and examine the use of a victims' sexual history as evidence.\nThere are many possible factors behind the fall in prosecutions. \nThe report argued it was due to \"a strained relationship\" between different parts of the system, lack of support for the victims and \"an increase in invasive requests for their personal data\".\nAsked in his BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Robert Buckland replied: \"Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case.\"\nHe said the government was now \"seeking to make the necessary investment\" but also insisted \"it's about more than just money, it's about culture.\"\nHe argued that \"for too long\" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence. \n\"If your house is burgled people don't start asking 'why did you go out?'\u2026 all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences,\" he said.\nIn rape investigations, there has also been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media, making them more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims.\nVictims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird has said some victims withdraw their complaints because \"they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy\".\nThere have also been suggestions a secret conviction rate target, set by the CPS, led to prosecutors dropping weaker or more challenging cases. \nIn November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had introduced a target in 2016 that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. \nThe victims' commissioner welcomed the review's proposals but said the government \"has a mountain to climb if it is to restore victims' confidence\". Dame Vera said it was \"disheartening\" that the pre-recording of video evidence was not being introduced more widely. \nLabour's shadow solicitor general Ellie Reeves said the government's review had missed a \"real opportunity\" to improve the justice system, and accused the government of failing victims of rape \"on every front \u200bby pushing the justice system to the brink of collapse through a decade of cuts to police, courts and the CPS\".\nShe said \"piecemeal pilots\" and \"\u200btinkering\" would not be enough to fix the failures.\nAndrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the current system was \"in disarray\".\nShe said it was welcome the government had admitted women have been failed, but women's groups felt \"frustration and disappointment\" over how long the measures in the review would take to be rolled out. \n\"Waiting a further two years to see some of these recommendations come to fruition is too long,\" she added. \nAmelia Handy, policy lead for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said the review was \"a missed opportunity\". \n\"While there are individual elements of the government's report that are encouraging, it's hard to identify any big commitments that will radically and swiftly improve the experience of the justice system for victims and survivors,\" she said.\nShe called for \"independent research into who does and doesn't report sexual offences to the police\" and an urgent review into governance of the Crown Prosecution Service.\nSumanta Roy from Imkaan - an organisation tackling violence against women from ethnic minorities - called for ring-fenced funding \"to address the historical under-funding of specialist independent support services for black, minoritised women\".\nIf you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available at BBC Action Line."

      "tags": "Northern Ireland Assembly,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)",
      "text": "Edwin Poots has resigned as leader of DUP after just 21 days in the job. \nIt came after he agreed a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in and the Westminster government to ensure Paul Givan became Northern Ireland's first minister. \nA majority of DUP members in the assembly wanted to delay the process and he faced an internal revolt at a party meeting.\nMr Poots, who took over from Arlene Foster in May, narrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson in a leadership vote.\nEarlier on Thursday, Paul Givan was nominated as the new first minister at Stormont while Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill returned as deputy first minister.\nThe BBC understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned but not tabled at the meeting of DUP officers.\nParty sources described the meeting as \"robust\" and said it had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign.\nIt is thought the process to appoint his successor could move \"at pace\", according to one DUP figure. \nFor 21 days, Edwin Poots was living the dream, leading the party his father helped found, the party he joined as a teenager. \nHis DNA was DUP, but nobody could have predicted how quickly the dream turned sour. \nHe grabbed power by insisting he would be a \"listening leader\" for his assembly colleagues (MLAs) who had felt their voices weren't heard during the Foster years. \nBut ironically, his downfall was sealed when those same MLAs were ignored by their new leader.\nThey demanded that Edwin Poots stall the nomination of Paul Givan as first minister, but he didn't listen. \nHis fate was sealed and his dream was short lived.  \nIn a statement, Mr Poots said: \"I have asked the Party Chairman to commence an electoral process within the Party to allow for a new leader of the Democratic Unionist Party to be elected.\n\"The Party has asked me to remain in post until my successor is elected.\n \"This has been a difficult period for the Party and the country and I have conveyed to the Chairman my determination to do everything I can to ensure both Unionism and Northern Ireland is able to move forward to a stronger place.\"\nResponding to the news, a Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said the DUP leadership was \"a matter for that party\".\nIn a statement they added: \"Sinn F\u00e9in has worked for weeks to bring stability to the executive.\n\"We have monumental challenges ahead that will require unity of purpose and urgency. They include tackling the totally unacceptable hospital waiting lists that have left people crucified, in pain and without hope.\n\"That is our focus and should remain the focus of all ministers in the executive.\"\nThe nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood tweeted that he was \"sick of this soap opera\".\n\"We're in the middle of a pandemic, waiting lists are sky rocketing, our economy is in crisis. Maybe it's time for some grown up politics.\"\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie said the situation was \"inevitable\". \n\"It doesn`t matter who the leader of the DUP is because they will face the same critical issues which were negotiated and agreed on their watch,\" he added. \nThe planned North South Ministerial Council meeting in Armagh will now not be going ahead on Friday, the Irish government has said. \n\"Given political developments in Northern Ireland today, tomorrow's NSMC Plenary meeting has been postponed at the request of the northern side,\" a statement read.\nFormer DUP MP and Arlene Foster's special adviser Emma Little-Pengelly told BBC NI's The View that there had been \"monumental mistakes\" for his leadership.\nShe said Mr Poots had been \"keen\" to take the leadership and to effect change.\nShe said it had been difficult for him but \"he had no actual plan or strategy for how he was going to address issues in the party\".\n\"The legacy of his leadership is that the secretary of state and UK government will underwrite the Irish Language legislation and cultural package.\"\nProf Jon Tonge, of Liverpool University, who has written extensively about the DUP told the programme Mr Poots should have been better prepared.\n\"We knew what was coming from Sinn F\u00e9in - they wanted New Decade New Approach to be implemented and he should have been prepared for that, squared his party off, knowing Sinn F\u00e9in would smell blood as the DUP would be petrified by an election.\n\"That's how he has ended up where he is now - by not bringing his party with him and those assembly members who supported him weeks ago - deserted him in droves - his position was untenable from this morning.\"\nMr Poots had named Mr Givan as the party's choice to replace Mrs Foster as first minister, while Sinn F\u00e9in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister.\nThe vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting.\nSinn F\u00e9in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in the New Decade, New Approach deal (NDNA) that restored power sharing in January 2020.\nThe party called on Brandon Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster.\nMr Poots had said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022.\nWhen a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was \"disappointed\" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly."
