      "text": "An Italian man in Germany has been sentenced to three years in prison for threatening to bomb NHS hospitals, Black Lives Matter rallies and UK MPs.\nEmil Apreda, 33, sent emails from Berlin demanding \u00a310m worth of Bitcoin to not carry out the attacks.\nThe National Crime Agency said he made his threats in the spring and summer of 2020 as the NHS struggled with Covid.\nSenior officers kept the threats from the public for fear of patients being scared into not attending hospitals. \nApreda used encryption techniques and the dark web in an attempt to hide his identity, but police brought in behavioural, linguistics and cyber-crime experts to track him down. \nHe sent emails to the NHS pretending to be a far-right activist linked to the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, but police believe that was just a ruse to instil fear. \nHe was finally identified by German detectives and armed officers raided his home in Berlin on 15 June last year. \nFor the first time, the NCA has revealed details of the case, calling it \"one of the most significant threats we've seen for some time\" which took place at a time of \"deep and heightened anxiety\" in the UK. \nTim Court, the NCA's head of investigations, said the content of the emails was \"so threatening and so damaging\" that it was only disclosed to a \"very tight circle of people - and I mean very tight\" within the police and government. \nMeanwhile, security at hospitals was quietly stepped up. \nMr Court said the risks were both of loss of life and a loss of confidence in the NHS. \n\"At the height of this, we were losing nearly nearly 1,000 people a day - and for six weeks we're trying to manage somebody who could have been planting a bomb in a hospital, somewhere in the UK.\"\nA particular concern was that many patients were on ventilators or oxygen at the time, and it would have been more difficult to get them out of a hospital in the event of a credible bomb threat.  \nThe extortion campaign started on 26 April when Apreda sent an email to the NHS, making his demand for Bitcoin and warning that he would send a bomb in a package to a hospital in the UK if he was not paid. \nThis was followed by an identical email to an NCA control centre, followed by 16 more over six weeks. \nDuring that period, the death of George Floyd in the US and resulting protests in the UK prompted threats from him to blow up Black Lives Matter demonstrations. \nFinally, as the fourth anniversary of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right activist approached, he emailed that he would kill MPs - but did not name any.\nPolice behavioural and linguistics experts drew up a profile of the extortionist, who they decided was not from the UK. \nPolice say further \"technical leads\" pointed to Germany. He was finally identified by LKA, the German CID.\nApreda had been issuing deadlines for payment after which he said he would attack, so the day before the anniversary of Ms Cox's death, German police moved in, blowing open the front door of his Berlin flat and arresting him. \nPolice say he has background in computing, but they have discovered no links to Combat 18, despite his claims. \nThe far-right group has been active in the UK in the past, but now exists mainly in the US and Germany.\nApreda was charged and convicted of extortion in Germany, but the NCA said he could have faced terrorism charges if he had been brought to the UK. \nThe NCA  said he had no links that they could find with Britain, and therefore extraditing him had not been possible. It denied Brexit had been a major factor."

      "text": "Most curbs to people's daily lives have been lifted as Wales moves to the lowest level of Covid rules.\nRules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have been removed, while nightclubs are able to reopen for the first time since measures brought in to tackle the spread of Omicron were introduced after Christmas.\nSocial distancing rules were also scrapped as Wales moved into alert level zero on 28 January.\nPeople who test positive for Covid must now isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nHowever masks are still required to be worn in most public places in Wales, including shops, hospitals and on public transport. \nBut they are no longer needed for bars and restaurants, and changes to rules due to be announced later, mean they will also no longer be needed when visiting someone in their own room at a care home.\nWhat do the changes mean for people and businesses in Wales, and what can you do and when?\nChanges to rules have been made over the last two weeks, after First Minister Mark Drakeford laid out his plan to ease restrictions by the end of January.\nThe changes saw:\nFrom Thursday, 10 February Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero\nThe lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic, we were last in alert level zero at Christmas.\nUnder it most curbs to our daily life are removed, all businesses are allowed to reopen, but people still have to wear face masks in many public places, and self isolation rules still apply.\nSince 22 December, fully vaccinated adults, children aged between five and 18 and vaccine clinical trial participants identified as a close contact of a positive case of Covid-19 in Wales do not need to self-isolate. \nInstead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

We want, by 2030, for the government to have halted the decline in nature. We have every opportunity to hold their feet to the fire,\" she told BBC News.\nMs McGrady added: \"Covid has taught us lots of lessons, including the importance of nature. The public are behind it.\"\nThe project, part-funded by the People's Postcode Lottery, and supported by Historic England, will begin at a site in London. There are other plans for circles in Plymouth, Newcastle, Nottingham and other sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe National Trust's London Blossom Garden is being planted in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Newham. It's in the same borough as the temporary NHS Nightingale Covid-19 hospital. The local community was involved in the design.\nIt's designed to be a \"commemorative space\" to reflect on the impact Covid-19 has had on the capital. \nLondon's Mayor Sadiq Khan explained: \"This new public garden will create a lasting, living memorial to commemorate all those who have lost their lives in the pandemic. It will be a tribute to the amazing ongoing work of our key workers and create a space for Londoners to contemplate and reflect on all this global pandemic has meant to our city and world.\"\nThe nascent plan for a circle in Newcastle is supported by Newcastle City Council and Urban Green Newcastle (UGN). \nBarbara Hooper, UGN's director for parks and allotments, said: \"The events of the past year have highlighted more than ever how important it is for us all to have access to green space.  Somewhere for us to breathe fresh air, connect with nature, and find solace during difficult times.\"\nFollow Claire on Twitter."

      "tags": "Iran-US relations,United States,Syria",
      "text": "The US has carried out an air strike targeting Iran-backed militias in Syria, in the first military action undertaken by the Biden administration.\nThe Pentagon said the strike destroyed \"multiple facilities\" and was ordered in response to attacks against US and coalition personnel in Iraq.\nMilitia officials said one person had been killed but a war monitor reported at least 22 fatalities.\nSyria condemned the attack as a \"bad sign\" from the new US administration.\nThe Pentagon said its strike near the Iraqi border in eastern Syria was a \"proportionate military response\" that was taken \"together with diplomatic measures\", including consulting coalition partners.\nIt came after a civilian contractor was killed in a rocket attack on US targets earlier this month. A US service member and five other contractors were also injured when the rockets hit sites in Irbil, including a base used by the US-led coalition.\nRockets have also struck US bases in Baghdad, including the Green Zone, which houses the US embassy and other diplomatic missions.\nThere are about 2,500 US troops in Iraq to assist Iraqi forces in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group.\nAnalysis by Paul Adams, BBC News\nThe messaging around this strike is probably more important than the strike itself.\nTen days elapsed between the trigger - 15 February's rocket attack in Irbil - and retaliation.\nThe US defence secretary made a point of thanking the Iraqi government for its intelligence input.\nThe Pentagon said the air strikes had been conducted \"together with diplomatic measures\", including consultation with coalition partners.\nNor did the attacks take place on Iraqi soil, thus minimising any embarrassment for the government in Baghdad.\nIn short, Washington seems to be drawing a sharp distinction with the more intemperate, unilateral instincts of the previous administration. \nBut at a time when the Biden administration is exploring ways of reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the strikes also sends a message to Tehran: just because we're willing to sit down and talk doesn't mean your proxies around the region can do what they want.\nThe Pentagon said the strike on Friday was launched \"at President Biden's direction\".\nIt targeted facilities located at a border control point used by a number of Iran-backed militia groups, including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, who are allied with the Damascus government.\nKataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada have previously carried out or supported rocket attacks targeting US assets in the country. The US has launched retaliatory strikes.\nBut Kataib Hezbollah has denied involvement in recent attacks against US interests. \nIn its statement, the Pentagon said its latest operation \"sends an unambiguous message\".\n\"President Biden will act to protect American and Coalition personnel. At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to de-escalate the overall situation in both eastern Syria and Iraq,\" it said. \nThe US did not confirm any casualties, but an Iraqi militia official told the Associated Press news agency at least one fighter was killed and a number of others wounded.\nThe official said the strikes hit an area along the border between the Syrian city of Boukamal and the Iraqi town of Qaim.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said the US attack had killed at least 22 fighters from the Popular Mobilisation Forces, an Iraqi umbrella group of mostly Shia paramilitaries that includes Kataib Hezbollah. \n\"The strikes destroyed three lorries carrying munitions,\" the observatory's Rami Abdul Rahman earlier told AFP. \"There were many casualties.\"\nSeveral attacks targeting US personnel have been claimed by little-known groups. But some Iraqi and Western officials say these are a front for established militias, so they can carry out attacks without being held accountable.\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters he was  \"confident in the target that we went after\".\n\"We know what we hit,\" he said. \"We're confident that that target was being used by the same Shia militants that conducted the strikes\" on 15 February.\nSyria's foreign ministry said it \"strongly condemns the cowardly American aggression\".\n\"It is a bad sign regarding the policies of the new US administration, which should adhere to international\" norms, it said in a statement.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the US needed to spell out directly its plans for the region, and criticised the \"four or five minutes\" warning of the strike that the US had given Moscow, Syria's key ally.\nPentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said the strike was meant to punish the militias but not to escalate tensions with Iran, with whom the US is seeking to renew talks over a nuclear deal abandoned by former President Donald Trump, the New York Times reports. \nSince 2009, the US has designated Kataib Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation, accusing them of threatening the peace and stability of Iraq.\nIran's influence over Iraq's internal affairs has grown steadily since the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003."

      "text": "The Pfizer vaccine appears to slow the spread of coronavirus as well as preventing people getting seriously ill, a study at a hospital has found.\nThe findings support similar research by Public Health England and an Oxford-AstraZeneca study, examining whether vaccines can stop the virus spreading. \nThe researchers said the results were a \"genuine good news story\" but warned that other precautionary measures were still required to combat the virus.\nThe impact on transmission is critical.\nIf a vaccine only stops you getting severely ill - but you can still catch and pass on the virus - everyone will need to be immunised to be protected.\nBut if it also stops you spreading the virus, there would be a far greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who is vaccinated indirectly protects other people, too.\nAddenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, has been testing staff regularly for coronavirus, even if they do not have any symptoms. \nIt started rolling out the Pfizer vaccine in early December and just over a month later had a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated staff. \nThe regular swabbing showed 17 in 1,000 unvaccinated staff were testing positive in mid-January while only four in 1,000 staff who had had their first dose were positive. \nThere was a similar reduction among people who had no symptoms, but were still testing positive - and therefore potentially able to spread the virus unknowingly. \nThe headline results have been posted online, but the full data has not been reviewed by other scientists. \n\"This is a genuine good news story. People should be really pleased that the vaccine will protect them and they should have the vaccine in order to prevent themselves and others from getting infected,\" one of the researchers, Dr Mike Weeks, told the BBC.\nHowever, even with the vaccine there was not complete protection, he warned. \n\"The vaccine doesn't completely prevent infection and so handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, regular testing are as important as they ever are.\"\nThe Siren study, run by Public Health England, suggested one dose of Pfizer reduced the risk of infection by 70% and two doses by 85%.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is thought to reduce infections by around two-thirds.\nProf Lawrence Young, from Warwick Medical School. said: You can't spread the virus if you're not infected, and these studies show that the vaccine blocks infection in individuals who don't have symptoms but could pass on the infection.\"\nProf Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said: \"To see such a reduction in infection rates after a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is very impressive and shows that vaccination truly does offer a way out of the current restrictions and a much brighter future.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The UK's decision not to prioritise key workers such as teachers or police officers for a Covid jab is \"the moral thing to do\" and will \"save the most lives\", the health secretary has said. \nMatt Hancock confirmed the second phase of the vaccine rollout would follow expert advice to focus on age groups.\nMore than one in three adults in the UK have now had their first jab.\nOne of England's top medics said Covid death rates were lower for teachers than several other professions.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam said ONS data on occupations with the highest Covid death rates begin with restaurant and catering establishment managers or proprietors, followed by metal-working and machine operatives, food, drink and tobacco process operatives, chefs, and taxi and cab drivers.\nSpeaking at a coronavirus news conference at Downing Street, England's deputy chief medical officer also said the death rates for men in each of these groups were more than 100 deaths per 100,000, compared with 18.4 deaths per 100,000 male teachers.\n\"When we're getting down into phase two of the vaccine campaigns... being in the queue is more important than where you are in it,\" Prof Van-Tam said, adding: \"Be reassured the queue is moving really fast and that you're going to get to the front of the queue because it's moving fast.\"\nThe government aims to give a jab to all over-50s and those in specific at-risk groups by 15 April, in what is known as phase one of the UK's Covid vaccine rollout.\nIt has pledged to complete phase two - where all other adults are offered their first dose - by 31 July.\nThe decision on what order to give phase two vaccines in comes after experts advising the government said priority based on occupation would be \"more complex\" and could slow down the programme.\nAll four UK nations will follow the approach recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nMr Hancock said: \"Thankfully, teachers are no more likely to catch Covid than any other member of the population who goes to work, and so trying to come up with a scheme which prioritises one professional group over another would have been complicated to put in place and wouldn't have done what we asked the JCVI to do... which is to make sure that we minimise the people who die.\"\nUnions representing teachers and police have criticised the decision.\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the teachers' union NASUWT, said the government was \"failing to take all steps possible\" to ensure schools remained open \"without the risk of further closures or of further damaging disruption to children's education\".\nJohn Apter, from the Police Federation, said there was \"palpable anger\" from officers, adding: \"What is expected of policing does put them at risk. It does put them at risk of transmitting this virus.\" \nA statement from the chief constables in Wales said: \"Now the most vulnerable have been vaccinated we should seek to vaccinate those that risk their own safety and health.\"\nAnalysis by Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter\nThe next phase of the vaccination programme aimed at the under-50s is all about speed.\nThe more quickly they can be vaccinated, the more lives can be saved from Covid-19 which reduces pressure on hospitals and makes it more likely the road map out of lockdown can be delivered.\nThe government's committee of vaccine experts says that means people should be vaccinated according to what age they are and not what job they do.\nIt would be more complicated and more time-consuming to invite all teachers or police officers for their first dose than to make an offer to all those in their 40s, for example.\nResearch by the Office for National Statistics suggests a number of occupations have higher-than-average death rates, including restaurant workers, taxi drivers, metal workers and shop assistants - so which group would be prioritised first and how would they be identified? \nThe conclusion is that a fast, efficient rollout to all adults, by age group, is the best way to achieve the target of giving all adults a first dose by the end of July. \nMore than 19.1 million people in the UK have received their first jab so far, with 485,720 first doses given in the latest daily figure.\nAt least 95% of people aged 70 or over in Scotland and every region of England have received their first dose of the vaccine, apart from in London which has a slightly lower rate. Wales is also slightly behind.\nEquivalent age-related data for Northern Ireland is not yet available but NI's Department of Health said that all care home staff and residents have now been offered first and second doses of the vaccine.\nProf Van-Tam urged people to continue following lockdown rules after receiving a Covid jab.\nHe said there were \"some worry signs\" that some people who have had the jab were \"relaxing\" their compliance with restrictions on socialising.\n\"It's a bit like being 3-0 up in a [football] game and thinking 'well we can't possibly lose this now'. But how many times have we seen the other side take it 4-3? Do not wreck this now, it is too early to relax,\" he said.\nThe health secretary also urged people to continue to observe the stay-at-home rules, saying: \"We're nearly there - let's not blow it.\"\nMr Hancock pointed to a range of data that he said showed the pandemic \"isn't over yet\", including one in five local authority areas seeing a rise in cases in the past week. \nCovid infections are continuing to decline with strict lockdown measures in place across the UK.\nA further 345 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according Friday's daily figures, as well as 8,523 new confirmed cases of the virus.\nMeanwhile, former Prime Minister Theresa May, 64, has received her first dose of the vaccine.\nShe said in a tweet that the jab was \"effective and painless\"."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has talked by phone with King Salman of Saudi Arabia as he seeks to put relations with America's old ally on a new footing.\nHe \"affirmed the importance\" the US \"places on universal human rights and the rule of law\", the White House said.\nMr Biden made the call after reading a forthcoming US report into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nThe report is expected to implicate the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He denies involvement. \nMr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, pursued closer ties with Saudi Arabia.\nThe Trump administration had rejected a legal requirement to release the report in declassified form, focusing instead on improved co-operation with the Saudis.\nThe White House says Mr Biden will \"recalibrate\" the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\nKhashoggi, a US-based journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, was murdered in 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul, and his body dismembered.\nSaudi authorities blamed his death on a \"rogue operation\" by a team of agents sent to return him to the kingdom, and a Saudi court tried and sentenced five individuals to 20 years in prison last September, after initially sentencing them to death.\nThere was no mention of Khashoggi by name in the White House statement.\nMr Biden \"affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law\", the White House said.\nHe also \"noted positively\" the recent release of several Saudi-American activists and prominent Saudi women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul.\nMs Hathloul was released this month after almost three years in detention but remained subject to a travel ban and was forbidden from speaking to the media.\nHer release was also welcomed by UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, when she addressed the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Friday, but she noted that others \"continued to be unjustly detained\", Reuters news agency reports.     \nMr Biden and King Salman also discussed \"the longstanding partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia\", and the threat posed to Saudi Arabia by pro-Iranian groups. \nMr Biden told King Salman \"he would work to make the bilateral relationship as strong and transparent as possible\", the statement said. \nThe Khashoggi report is widely expected to say that the king's son, Prince Mohammed - popularly known as MBS - ordered the grisly death. \nNaming him publicly would put further stress on the US-Saudi relationship. Mr Biden would come under pressure to sanction MBS and any other senior officials and entities said to be complicit in the murder. \nYet the crown prince could one day, perhaps any day, become the official ruler of an important Mid-East ally. \nGiven this, the White House has signalled a nuanced response, saying in some areas it would express concerns and leave open the option of accountability, and in other areas continue to work with Riyadh.\nThe 59-year-old journalist, known for his criticism of the Saudi authorities, went to the consulate in October 2018 in order to obtain papers allowing him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e. \nHe had allegedly received assurances from the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, who was ambassador to the US at the time, that it would be safe to visit the consulate. Prince Khalid has denied any communication with the journalist.\nAccording to Saudi prosecutors, Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the consulate, prosecutors said. The remains were never found.\nGrim details were revealed in transcripts of purported audio recordings of the killing obtained by Turkish intelligence.\nKhashoggi had once been an adviser to the Saudi government and close to the royal family but he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017.\nFrom there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Prince Mohammed.\nIn his first column for the newspaper, Khashoggi said he feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince.\nIn his last column, he criticised Saudi involvement in the conflict in Yemen."

      "title": "Nigeria's Zamfara school abduction: More than 300 Nigerian girls missing",
      "text": "More than 300 schoolgirls have been kidnapped by unidentified gunmen from a school in north-western Nigeria. \nPolice say they believe the girls were taken to a forest after being abducted from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara state, on Friday morning.\nIt is the latest mass kidnapping from schools in recent weeks. Armed gangs often seize schoolchildren for ransom.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari condemned the latest kidnapping as \"inhumane and totally unacceptable\".\n\"This administration will not succumb to blackmail by bandits who target innocent school students in the expectations of huge ransom payments,\" he said in a statement.\n\"Our primary objective is to get the hostages safe, alive and unharmed.\"\nMr Buhari said that although authorities could deploy \"massive force against the bandits\", there were fears that the schoolgirls could be used as human shields.\nAt least 42 people, including 27 students, who were kidnapped last week in Kagara, in neighbouring Niger state, are yet to be released.\nThe 2014 kidnap of 276 schoolgirls in the north-eastern town of Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria but the most recent attacks are suspected to be the work of criminal gangs.\nFriday's attack happened at 01:00 local time (midnight GMT) when a group of gunmen arrived at the Government Girls Secondary School in Jangebe town with pick-up vehicles and motorcycles, a teacher told news site Punch. \nSome of the gunmen were dressed as government security forces, the report said, adding that they forced the schoolgirls in the vehicles. \nBut other witnesses have told the BBC that the armed men arrived on foot at the school. \nThe witness told BBC Hausa that more than 100 gunmen entered the school. \n\"They broke the school gate and shot at the security man. Then they moved into the hostels and woke up the girls, telling them it was time for prayers. After gathering all of them, the girls were crying and they took them away to the forest. They were also shooting in the air as they were marching to the forest,\" the witness said. \nDistraught parents later gathered outside the school and some have gone out into the bush to look for their daughters, witnesses say.\nA teacher told the BBC that of 421 students in the school at the time, only 55 had been accounted for.\nA police statement said its officers and a military contingent had been deployed to Jangebe to search for the girls. \nThe UN children's agency Unicef said it was ''angered and saddened'' by yet another mass abduction of students in Nigeria describing it as ''brutal'' and a ''violation of children's rights.'' \nNo group has so far claimed responsibility. \nArmed groups operating in Zamfara often kidnap for ransom but when gunmen took more than 300 boys from Kankara in neighbouring Katsina state in December last year, some reports claimed that Boko Haram, which operates hundreds of miles away in the north-east, was behind the attack. \nThe claims were later disputed and the boys released after negotiations. \nEvery time children are taken from their schools by armed gunmen in northern Nigeria, the kidnapping of the Chibok girls is mentioned. \nSimilar raids took place before that well-publicised abduction but they received little publicity and they never involved girls. \nBut global attention generated by the #BringBackOurGirls campaign showed armed groups that the mass abduction of children was a sure way of applying pressure on authorities, including asking for ransom, although the authorities always deny paying.\nThe government does not appear to have a strategy for stopping these incidents from happening. \nBut two weeks ago, lawmakers from Zamfara state suggested offering amnesty to repentant kidnappers in exchange for sustainable economic opportunities. \nIt's a controversial strategy but one that yielded some positive results in the Niger Delta, which saw a reduction in crime after a similar amnesty programme in 2009. \nThe government so far says it will not negotiate with criminals. \nIn the meantime, schools in rural northern Nigeria are more vulnerable than they've ever been.\nA \"Safe School Initiative\" was launched after the Chibok girls were abducted to bolster security in schools in Nigeria's north-eastern region by building fences around them. \nAt least $20m ($14m) was pledged for the three-year project which was supported by the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, Gordon Brown,  the former UK prime minister.\nMany container schools were built as temporary learning spaces as part of the scheme, but it is not known if any fences were built in communities affected.\nThough most of the recent kidnappings have happened in the north-west, which were not covered by the Safe Schools Initiative, the 2018 abduction of 110 schoolgirls from Government Science School, Dapchi in north-eastern Yobe state raised questions about the success of the initiative."

      "text": "Welsh exports to Ireland are being blocked by extra paperwork and costs at customs, says CBI Wales. \nDirector Ian Price said the authorities in the Republic of Ireland were \"zealous\" when checking goods which was \"causing some delays.\"\nHe said documents had been rejected for being written in blue not black ink.\nIreland's consul general in Wales insisted the Irish Government was \"focused\" on facilitating trade between the two countries.\nMr Price called for \"consistency of approach\" when exporting to the EU.\nThe republic is Wales' fourth biggest export market, behind Germany, France and the US and the fifth largest market for the UK.\nTrade worth \u00a320bn goes back and forth across the Irish Sea every week.\nBut since 1 January, there has been a drop in UK-Ireland traffic at Holyhead and Pembroke Dock.\nMr Price said it's difficult to tell whether this was down to companies \"biding their time\" because they foresaw problems or if it is \"a genuine change in the way people are moving their goods.\"\n\"There's no denying costs of freight have increased quite largely and it's hard to judge at the moment, whether this is a temporary glitch, or whether this is something that is with us for good,\" he explained.\n\"Quite clearly there's a lot more administration involved now we're moving goods from ourselves into mainland Europe and as a consequence, it requires more people, requires more time or documentation and that in itself creates a cost.\"\nThis was \"a burden\" being absorbed by UK businesses, he said. \nIreland's consul general in Wales, Denise Hanrahan said: \"Ireland and Wales are so closely tied, our shared Irish sea border is one of the vital links between us.\n\"The UK has left the EU customs union, has left the single market, and that inevitably requires then systems to be put in place to manage the customs, the health aspects, the animal safety aspects.\n\"All of those normal aspects of trading.\"\nMs Hanrahan said it was a \"steep learning curve.\"\nThe Irish Government was supporting businesses \"to learn as much as possible as to how they can best interact with those systems.\"\nJosh Burbidge, managing director of 150-year-old family firm Archwood Group, says the Irish market is \"significant\".\nIt is worth more than \u00a3600,000 in annual revenue to the business, based in Chirk, Wrexham, he said.\n\"We made the conscious decision to stop exporting anything to Ireland for two weeks at the start of January to help with the paperwork, and ensure that we had everything sorted in terms of all of the regulation,\" he explained.\nDeliveries have recently been delayed by six weeks and while currently absorbing extra costs, the firm cannot do so forever.\n\"Every pallet we send in as an extra \u00a365, and every consignment or individual parcel is \u00a36.50,\" he said.\n\"We're not in a high margin business. Therefore, we won't be able to continue absorbing those costs on the longer term.\" \nWrexham Lager sales manager Joss Roberts, said Brexit complications were having a \"major impact\", despite the majority of business comes from the UK. \n\"Prices are becoming unrealistic,\" said Mr Roberts. \n\"We've had to cancel three Irish orders this morning because the end receiver is expected to pay \u20ac11.50 per crate, that's on top of an admin courier fee.\n\"It's gone up around \u00a317 alone to the Republic of Ireland where as to the likes of Spain it's gone up over \u20ac60 a crate.\"\nHe has written to customers to warn them of the extra fees. \nThe business will \"have to work out a way.\"\nHe said: \"Do they ring us and pay the extra over the phone? Do we put an extra addition on our cost on the website? It's hassle that from December wasn't there.\"\n\"We just hope it can get better soon.\""

      "text": "The Queen has urged the public to \"think about other people\" and get a Covid jab when they are offered one.\nThe monarch, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, received their first doses of the vaccine in January.\nIn a video call with health leaders delivering the Covid vaccine across the UK, the Queen was asked about her experience of having the jab.\nShe smiled as she replied: \"Well, as far as I can make out it was quite harmless.\n\"It was very quick, and I've had lots of letters from people who've been very surprised by how easy it was to get the vaccine.\"\nThe Queen, who rarely talks about her own health, added: \"It didn't hurt at all.\"\nThe monarch said she understood getting a jab could be a \"difficult\" experience for some people but urged everyone to \"think about other people rather than themselves\".\nIt comes after UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said figures suggested 11-15% of people were vaccine-hesitant, with data skewed toward some black and ethnic minority communities.\nSome studies have also found disparities between poorer and wealthier areas.\nDr Emily Lawson, who is leading the vaccine deployment programme for the NHS in England, said the Queen's comments about her vaccine experience were an \"incredibly important vote of confidence in the programme\".\n\"We just want to make sure we create the conditions where everybody feels able to take up the offer of a vaccination when they're called,\" she said.\n\"And Her Majesty offering her view on that is a huge boost to our confidence and I hope to confidence more broadly in the programme.\"\nThe Queen also said the speed of the UK's vaccination rollout had been \"remarkable\" so far.\nSpeaking to the four officials overseeing the programme in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, she added: \"Keep up the good work.\"\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nDuring the video call, which was held on Tuesday, the monarch likened the pandemic to a \"plague\" that has swept across the globe.\nAfter Derek Grieve, head of the Scottish government's vaccine rollout, told the head of state he would like to \"bottle\" the community spirit he had witnessed during the epidemic, she said it felt \"very much like\" the wartime spirit she experienced.\nMeanwhile, the Countess of Wessex has begun volunteering at a vaccination centre in south-west London.\nSophie, who is a St John Ambulance care volunteer, completed the required training to help provide reassurance and information to vaccine recipients.\nSt John Ambulance said it was \"delighted\" to welcome the countess to its team of more than 10,000 trained volunteers in vaccine centres across England.\nMore than 18 million people have had a first vaccine dose - equivalent to one in three adults in the UK.\nThe vaccine rollout has entered its next phase, after everyone in the top four priority groups was offered a jab. Many areas are now offering vaccine appointments to over-60s, adult carers of disabled people and younger adults in care homes.\nSome 600,000 people out of 1.7 million added to the shielding list last week are now being invited to book a slot for a vaccine, NHS England said, while the remainder have already had their jabs as part of the first phase of the vaccination programme. \nThe Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have both received their first doses of the vaccine, with Camilla saying she \"leapt for joy\" after getting her jab.\nAnd the Duke of Cambridge said at a vaccine centre in Norfolk on Monday that he would be at the \"front of the queue\" for a vaccine to help to reassure people of its safety, but that he would \"wait my turn\".\nDuring his visit William also said his grandfather, Prince Philip, was \"OK\" after being admitted to hospital last week. \nThe Duke of Edinburgh remains at King Edward VII's Hospital in central London where he is being treated for an infection."

      "text": "A former US Olympics gymnastics coach has killed himself hours after he was charged with sexual assault and human trafficking, officials say.\nMichigan's attorney general confirmed the death of John Geddert, hours after outlining 24 charges against him. \nGeddert was head coach of the women's gymnastics team in 2012 and worked closely with team doctor Larry Nassar. \nNassar was sentenced to up to 300 years in jail in 2018 for abusing more than 250 girls from his position. \nThe widespread abuse revelations have caused intense scrutiny of USA Gymnastics and criticism of how it safeguards athletes.\nGeddert, 63, had owned the training facility in Michigan where Nassar had served as the gym's doctor. A number of gymnasts accused him of abusive behaviour when they testified during Nassar's trial.\nHe was expected to turn himself in on Thursday afternoon but did not appear, the attorney general's office said. \n\"My office has been notified that the body of John Geddert was found late this afternoon after taking his own life,\" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel later said in a statement.\n\"This is a tragic end to a tragic story for everyone involved.\"\nEarlier, Ms Nessel had announced 24 separate charges against Geddert that \"focus around multiple acts of verbal, physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by the defendant against multiple young women\".\nTwo of the counts involved the alleged sexual assault of a girl between the age of 13 and 16.\nHe also faced 14 human trafficking charges for allegedly subjecting \"his athletes to forced labor or services under extreme conditions that contributed to them suffering injuries and harm\".\nGeddert \"neglected those injuries that were reported to him by the victims and used coercion, intimidation, threats and physical force to get them to perform to the standard he expected,\" the attorney general's statement said.\nA lawyer for some of Geddert's alleged victims had earlier welcomed the interpretation of human trafficking laws in the case and said it marked \"an important step in child protection\" to potentially deter similar actions by others.  \nGeddert was also accused of lying to investigators in 2016 during the probe into the allegations against Nassar.\n\"Geddert's abuse, like so much, was never a secret. EVER,\" tweeted Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar. \n\"We have to grapple with the reality that it was known, and no one stopped him.\"\nSarah Klein, the first known victim of Nassar, told NBC 25 News on Thursday that the abuse from Geddert was worse, describing it as \"pure trauma\".\nIn a statement, Ms Klein - who is now an attorney and advocate for victims of sexual abuse - called Geddert's death an \"escape from justice\" for \"a narcissistic abuser\".\nSara Teristi, another former gymnast who trained under Geddert, said his death \"victimised us all over again\".\n\"I am thankful that the survivors will not have to endure a lengthy and painful trial, but I am saddened that the chance to see justice served has been stolen from us,\" she said. \"We deserve better.\"\nEchoing those sentiments, a third survivor, Makayla Thrush, told Fox 2 Detroit that Geddert's passing means \"no closure for me at all\".\nIn January 2020, USA Gymnastics announced a plan to pay a $215m (\u00a3164m) settlement to the group of athletes abused by Nassar. \nUSA Gymnastics president and chief executive Li Li Leung has said they \"recognise how deeply we have broken the trust of our athletes and community, and are working hard to build that trust back\".\nBut some, including the US's most decorated gymnast, Simone Biles, believe the organisation \"has not taken full accountability for its actions\" over the scandal.\nBiles, 23, who was one of the gymnasts abused by Nassar, has called for an independent investigation.\n\"We bring them medals. We do our part. You can't do your part in return?\" she told CBS last week. \"It's just, like, it's sickening.\""

      "text": "Shamima Begum - the schoolgirl who fled London to join the Islamic State group in Syria - has said she never wanted to be an IS \"poster girl\".\nMs Begum, who has just given birth, said she now wants the UK's forgiveness and supports \"some British values\". \nShe told the BBC while it was \"wrong\" innocent people died in the 2017 Manchester attack, it was \"kind of retaliation\" for attacks on IS.\nThe 19-year-old left Bethnal Green four years ago with two school friends.\nThere has been debate about Ms Begum's plight since she was found in a Syrian refugee camp by the Times newspaper last week after reportedly leaving Baghuz, IS's last stronghold in the country.\nShe gave birth to a baby boy last weekend, having previously lost two children, and named him after her first son.  \nWhile she told the BBC she would have let her late son become an IS fighter, she wants her new baby \"to be British\" and for her to return to the UK with him. \nIn an interview with the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville on Monday, Ms Begum said: \"I don't actually agree with everything they've done.\n\"I actually do support some British values and I am willing to go back to the UK and settle back again and rehabilitate and that stuff.\" \nHome Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs on Monday that he would not \"hesitate to prevent\" the return of Britons who travelled to Syria to join IS. While the UK cannot leave people stateless, under international law, he said any such Britons would be \"questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted\". \nNo British troops would be used to help or rescue them, he said. He told MPs that more than 100 dual nationals have already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. \n\"If you back terror, there must be consequences,\" he said. More than 900 people have left the UK to join the conflict in Syria, said Mr Javid, adding that those who join IS have \"shown they hate our country and the values that we stand for\". \nAsked about the Manchester Arena attack in 2017 in which 22 people - some of them children - were killed in a bombing claimed by IS, she said: \"I was shocked. I didn't know about the kids, actually. I do feel that is wrong. Innocent people did get killed.\"\nShe compared the attack to military assaults on Syria, saying: \"It's one thing to kill a soldier, it's fine, it's self-defence. But to kill people like women and children just like the women and children in Baghuz who are being killed right now unjustly by the bombings - it's a two-way thing really because women and children are being killed back in the Islamic State right now. \n\"It's kind of retaliation. Their justification was that it was retaliation so I thought, okay, that is a fair justification.\"\nMs Begum said she was sorry for all the families who had lost people because of the attacks in the UK and other countries.\n\"That wasn't fair on them,\" she said. \"They weren't fighting anyone. They weren't causing any harm. But neither was I and neither were other women who are being killed right now back in Baghuz.\"\nWhen it was suggested that her going to Syria might have been a \"propaganda victory\" for IS, Ms Begum said: \"I did hear a lot of people were encouraged to come after, but I wasn't the one who put myself on the news.\"\nShe added: \"The poster girl thing was not my choice.\"\nMs Begum said she made the choice to go to Syria and could make her own decisions, despite being only 15 at the time. She said she was partly inspired by videos of fighters beheading hostages and also by videos showing \"the good life\" under IS. \nShe watched videos of the murders of British hostages, she told the BBC, but said she did not know the names of any of the victims. \nOur correspondent said that \"throughout the interview, Shamima Begum continued to espouse Islamic State philosophy.\" He added: \"When I asked her about the enslavement, murder and rape of Yazidi women by IS, she said 'Shia do the same in Iraq'.\"\nBut she said: \"I just want forgiveness really, from the UK. Everything I've been through, I didn't expect I would go through that.\n\"Losing my children the way I lost them, I don't want to lose this baby as well and this is really not a place to raise children, this camp.\"  \nTwelve more British women have arrived at the camp in Syria in the last week and more are expected, our correspondent added. \nEarlier, the lawyer representing Ms Begum's family said she is \"damaged\" and will need mental health support. Tasnime Akunjee also said her family are prepared to raise her newborn baby away from \"IS thinking\".\nHe said Ms Begum - who is legally British - had still not been in contact with her family and the family are trying to get the government to provide travel documents for Ms Begum and her newborn son, who he said has a right to citizenship.\nMs Begum left the UK in February 2015 with two other schoolgirls, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase. Kadiza is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Amira is unknown.\nMr Akunjee also called for an \"urgent inquiry\" into how Ms Begum and the other schoolgirls were able to travel to Syria. \nPreviously, Ms Begum said she escaped from Baghuz, Islamic State's last stronghold in eastern Syria, two weeks ago.\nHer husband, a Dutch convert to Islam, is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters.\nUnder international law, the UK is obliged to let a Briton without the claim to another nationality return home.\nBut the government does not have consular staff in Syria, and says it will not risk any lives to help Britons who have joined a banned terrorist group.\nIf Ms Begum is able to reach a British consulate in a recognised country, it is thought security chiefs could \"manage\" her return."

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Alex Salmond has said he has \"no doubt\" that Nicola Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code.\nThe former first minister was speaking as he made his long-awaited appearance at a Scottish Parliament inquiry. \nMr Salmond gave an account to the committee of meetings he had with Ms Sturgeon that appeared to contradict her version of events. \nBut he said it was not for him to say whether Ms Sturgeon should resign if she was found to have broken the code. \nMs Sturgeon denies breaching the code, and has accused Mr Salmond of creating \"wild\" conspiracy theories that are untrue. \nHer spokesman said Mr Salmond had failed to prove his allegations in his evidence to the committee, and \"also gave testimony which directly undermined some of the central planks of his conspiracy theories\". \nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of harassment allegations against Mr Salmond.\nThe government admitted it had acted unlawfully during its investigation into the initial complaints from two female civil servants after Mr Salmond launched a judicial review case, and had to pay his legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond was arrested two weeks after the government admitted defeat in the civil case, and was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against a total of nine women after a trial at the High Court last year. \nHe has previously accused people close to Ms Sturgeon - his successor as both first minister and SNP leader - of plotting against him, and has named Ms Sturgeon's husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, as being one of them.\nMr Salmond told the committee that he had been given a memory stick in the build up to his criminal trial that contained messages which involved \"pressuring police\", \"collusion of witnesses\" and \"construction of evidence because police were felt to be inadequate in finding it themselves\".\nHe said he would \"dearly love to provide\" more detail about the messages - but was unable to do so because he was \"under an injunction\" that could see him prosecuted for revealing evidence that was given to him as part of the criminal proceedings. \nAsked what the motivation would be for a plot against him, Mr Salmond said some in the Scottish government saw the judicial review case as a \"huge, looming, enormous and difficult problem\".\nHe said the potential impact on Ms Sturgeon and others in the government of a \"disastrous\" defeat in the civil case meant \"it became very important that the criminal case overtook the judicial review\".\nPart of the written evidence submitted by Mr Salmond ahead of the committee meeting was removed on the request of the Crown Office earlier this week after it had already been published in full by the Scottish Parliament.\nThe submissions included claims that Ms Sturgeon misled parliament over when she first learned of the allegations against her former political mentor. \nThis was one of the most extraordinary episodes in Holyrood's short history.\nIn six hours of testimony, Scotland's longest serving first minister set out what he believes was a malicious plot against him by key figures in the SNP and the Scottish government - both of which he used to lead.\nHis voice cracked with emotion as he accused former colleagues of pressurising police and potential witnesses to build a criminal case against him - claims they deny.\nHe was not able to present the social media messages that he believes will prove this case but during his appearance the Scottish Parliament issued an order demanding their release by Scottish prosecutors. \nFor their parts in the botched handling of the original harassment complaints against him, Alex Salmond called for the resignation of Scotland's top civil servant and its top law officer.\nBut he stopped short of demanding his former ally, friend and political partner - Nicola Sturgeon - stand down despite arguing that she had repeatedly broken the rules for ministers.\nHe said her fate should be decided by others after she's given evidence next week and the inquiries into this toxic affair have delivered their verdicts. \nMs Sturgeon initially told parliament she had not learned of the complaints until she was informed by Mr Salmond on 2 April 2018.\nHowever, she later claimed to have \"forgotten\" about an earlier meeting in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March of that year, when she was told about the allegations by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein.\nMr Salmond told the committee that if Ms Sturgeon had truly forgotten about the meeting, she should have corrected the record when she did remember.\nBut he said Ms Sturgeon had only admitted that the meeting had taken place after details of it were revealed 18 months later by Sky News. \nHe also said there was \"no doubt\" that the meeting with Mr Aberdein and subsequent meetings between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon in her home were about government matters rather than SNP business, as she has claimed.\nThis could potentially be another breach of the code, which says all government business and meetings should be recorded - but none of them were.\nMr Salmond also alleged that the name of one of the women who had made complaints about him was made known to Mr Aberdein ahead of his meeting with Ms Sturgeon.\nMs Sturgeon told parliament on Thursday that \"to the very best of my knowledge I do not think that happened.\"\nThe first minister has also been accused of potentially breaching the code by allowing the government to continue opposing a civil court case brought by Mr Salmond over its handling of the initial complaints against him from two female civil servants. \nMr Salmond has alleged that the government was given legal advice that it was unlikely to win the case on 31 October 2018 - but did not concede defeat until January of the following year. \nMr Salmond said: \"I have no doubt Nicola has broken the ministerial code, but it's not for me to decide what the consequences should be.\"\nA separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the code, which states that any minister who deliberately misleads parliament would be expected to resign.\nMr Salmond said he was due to be interviewed by Mr Hamilton next week.\nThe last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmond's complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second.\nThe former First Minister of Scotland has just accused his successor of breaking the ministerial code - and left open the door for her having to resign as a result.\nHe has said Scotland's most senior civil servant should quit - and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position.\nNicola Sturgeon's allies will argue he has not provided evidence for his claims of a plot against him.\nBut Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears before MSPs next week - some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. \nThe marathon evidence session - which lasted six hours - also saw Mr Salmond claim that the leadership of the Scottish government, civil service and Crown Office prosecution service had all \"failed\".\nHe said no one had taken responsibility for the \"nightmare\" he had been put through, and said the country's top civil servant, Leslie Evans should quit, and that the head of the Crown Office, Lord Advocate James Wolffe, should consider his position. \nHe also alleged that there had been a \"deliberate suppression of information inconvenient to the government\" throughout the saga.\nAnd he called for a police investigation into how details of the complaints against him were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper, and said he believed the leak came from within the government and was politically motivated. \nAn Information Commissioner's Office investigation into the leak found no \"hard evidence\" that it came from the government - but said it had \"some sympathy\" to the view that it had. \nMr Salmond went on to say he did not believe the House of Commons would accept a call from the Crown Prosecution Service in England to change a committee document, as the Scottish Parliament had done in response to the Crown Office request. \nHe said he had \"no incentive or advantage in revisiting the hurt and shock of the last three years\".\nBut he added: \"We can't turn the page or move on until the decision-making which is undermining the system of government in Scotland is addressed.\"\nHe said the country's \"move to independence\" - which he has campaigned for throughout his political life - \"must be accompanied by institutions whose leadership is strong and robust and capable of protecting each and every citizen from arbitrary authority\".\nMs Sturgeon has denied there was any conspiracy against Mr Salmond, and has said she is \"relishing\" the prospect of giving evidence to the committee next week.\nAnswering questions from journalists at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, she said: \"I don't think there is a shred of evidence behind those allegations and the claims that have been made\".\nShe claimed that Mr Salmond had created an \"alternative reality in which the organs of the state - not just me, the SNP and the civil service and the Crown Office and the police and women who came forward - were all part of some wild conspiracy against him for reasons I can't explain\".\nAnd she added: \"Maybe that's easier than just accepting that at the root of all this might just have been issues in his own behaviour.\"\nA spokeswoman for the government said Ms Evans continued to have the support of the first minister and would not be resigning as the head of the civil service in Scotland.\nThe spokeswoman also said the government had a \"duty to investigate the serious and specific complaints against Alex Salmond and was right to do so\".  \nShe added: \"As set out in detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code.\"\nA spokesman for the Crown Office said: \"Scotland's prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case.\"\nThe Lord Advocate will give evidence to the committee on Monday, before Ms Sturgeon - who will be the final witness - appears on Wednesday.

      "tags": "Amazon rainforest,Brazil,Facebook",
      "text": "Parts of Brazil's Amazon rainforest are being illegally sold on Facebook, the BBC has discovered.\nThe protected areas include national forests and land reserved for indigenous peoples.\nSome of the plots listed via Facebook's classified ads service are as large as 1,000 football pitches.\nFacebook said it was \"ready to work with local authorities\", but indicated it would not take independent action of its own to halt the trade.\n\"Our commerce policies require buyers and sellers to comply with laws and regulations,\" the Californian tech firm added.\nThe leader of one of the indigenous communities affected has urged the tech firm to do more.\nAnd campaigners have claimed the country's government is unwilling to halt the sales.\n\"The land invaders feel very empowered to the point that they are not ashamed of going on Facebook to make illegal land deals,\" said Ivaneide Bandeira, head of environmental NGO Kanind\u00e9.\nAnyone can find the illegally invaded plots by typing the Portuguese equivalents for search terms like \"forest\", \"native jungle\" and \"timber\" into Facebook Marketplace's search tool, and picking one of the Amazonian states as the location.\nSome of the listings feature satellite images and GPS co-ordinates. \nMany of the sellers openly admit they do not have a land title, the only document which proves ownership of land under Brazilian law.\nThe illegal activity is being fuelled by Brazil's cattle ranching industry. \nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is at a 10-year high, and Facebook's Marketplace has become a go-to site for sellers like Fabricio Guimar\u00e3es, who was filmed by a hidden camera. \n\"There's no risk of an inspection by state agents here,\" he said as he walked through a patch of rainforest he had burnt to the ground.\nWith the land illegally cleared and ready for farming, he had tripled his initial asking price to $35,000 (\u00a325,000). \nFabricio is not a farmer. He has steady middle-class job in a city, and views the rainforest as being an investment opportunity.\nThe BBC later contacted Fabricio for his response to its investigation but he declined to comment.\nMany of the ads came from Rond\u00f4nia, the most deforested state in Brazil's rainforest region.\nThe BBC arranged meetings between four sellers from the state and an undercover operative posing as a lawyer claiming to represent wealthy investors.\nOne man, called Alvim Souza Alves, was trying to sell a plot inside the Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous reserve for about \u00a316,400 in local currency. \nIt is the home to a community of more than 200 Uru Eu Wau Wau people. And at least five further groups that have had no contact with the outside world also live there, according to the Brazilian government.\nBut at the meeting, Mr Alves claimed: \"There are no Indians [sic] there. From where my land is, they are 50km [31 miles] away. I am not going to tell you that at one time or another they are not walking around.\"\nThe BBC showed the Facebook ad to community leader Bitat\u00e9 Uru Eu Wau Wau.\nHe said the lot was in an area used by his community to hunt, fish and collect fruits.\n\"This is a lack of respect,\" he said. \n\"I don't know these people. I think their objective is to deforest the indigenous land, to deforest what is standing. To deforest our lives, you could say.\"\nHe said the authorities should intervene, and also urged Facebook - \"the most accessed social media platform\" - to take action of its own.\nAnother factor driving the illegal land market is the expectation of amnesty. \nMr Alves revealed he was working with others to lobby politicians to help them legally own stolen land.\n\"I'll tell you the truth: if this is not solved with [President] Bolsonaro there, it won't be solved anymore,\" he said of the current government.\nA common strategy is to deforest the land and then plead with politicians to abolish its protected status, on the basis it no longer serves its original purpose.\nThe land grabbers can then officially buy the plots from the government, thereby legalising their claims. \nMr Alves took the BBC's undercover reporter to meet a man he described as the leader of the Curupira Association. Brazil's federal police have described the group as being an illegal land-grabbing operation focused on invading indigenous territory.\nThe two men told the reporter that high-profile politicians were helping them set up meetings with government agencies in the capital Bras\u00edlia.\nThey said their main ally was congressman Colonel Chris\u00f3stomo, a member of the Social Liberal Party, which Mr Bolsonaro used to be a member of until he founded his own party in 2019. \nWhen contacted by the BBC, Colonel Chris\u00f3stomo acknowledged having helped arrange meetings, but said he did not know the group was involved in land invasions.\n\"They didn't tell me,\" he said. \"If they invaded [the land], they don't have my support anymore.\"\nWhen asked if he regretted setting up the meetings, he said: \"No.\" \nThe BBC contacted Mr Alves for his response but he declined to comment.\nThe BBC also approached Brazil's Minister of the Environment, Ricardo Salles.\nHe said: \"President Jair Bolsonaro's government has always made it clear that his is a zero-tolerance government for any crime, including environmental ones.\"\nThe government has cut the inspections budget for Ibama, the federal agency that in charge of regulating deforestation, by 40%. \nBut Mr Salles said the coronavirus pandemic had hampered law enforcement in the Amazon, and that state governments also bore responsibility for the deforestation.\n\"This year the government has created operation Verde Brasil 2, which seeks to control illegal deforestation, illegal fires, and to join efforts between the federal government and the states,\" he added.\nHowever Raphael Bevilaquia, a federal prosecutor based in Rond\u00f4nia, said the situation had worsened under the current government.\n\"The situation is really desperate,\" he said. \"The executive power is playing against us. It's disheartening.\" \nFor its part, Facebook claims trying to deduce which sales are illegal would be too complex a task for it to carry out itself, and should be left to the local judiciary and other authorities. And it does not appear to see the issue as being serious enough to warrant halting all Marketplace land sales across the Amazon.\nIvaneide Bandeira, who has been trying to combat deforestation in the state of Rond\u00f4nia for 30 years, said she was losing hope.\n\"I think this is a very hard battle. It is really painful to see the forest being destroyed and shrinking more and more,\" she said.\n\"Never, in any other moment in history, has it been so hard to keep the forest standing.\"\nOur World: Selling the Amazon will be broadcast on BBC World News at 2330 GMT, and on the BBC News Channel this Saturday and Sunday at 2130 GMT. It will also be available on iPlayer."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Alex Salmond is being questioned by MSPs over his claims of a \"malicious and concerted\" conspiracy against him.\nThe former first minister is appearing at Holyrood as part of an inquiry into the government's mishandling of sexual harassment complaints about him.\nThe four-hour session is expected to focus on that botched probe and the accusations made by Mr Salmond.\nNicola Sturgeon has challenged her predecessor to prove his claims, saying there is \"not a shred of evidence\".\nThe first minister is expected to give evidence to the inquiry committee herself on Wednesday.\nThe Holyrood session with Mr Salmond began at 12:30. \nIt has been delayed on several occasions due to a row over his written submissions, which make a range of accusations about the conduct of the first minister, government officials, the SNP and the prosecution service.\nHe wrote that there had been \"a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort among a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned\".\nAnd he claimed there had been a \"complete breakdown of the necessary barriers which should exist between government, political party and indeed the prosecution authorities\".\nHe has also taken aim directly at Ms Sturgeon, accusing her of \"repeatedly\" misleading parliament about her involvement in the row and of breaching the ministerial code.\nThe SNP leader has hit back Mr Salmond's claims, saying he is \"creating an alternative reality in which the organs of the state...are all part of some wild conspiracy against him for reasons I can't explain\".\nAnd she has challenged him to back the allegations up with proof, saying he has an \"obligation\" to \"replace the insinuation and assertion we have heard over several months now with evidence\".\nIt's been more than six years since Alex Salmond stood down as first minister after losing the independence referendum and now he's back at Holyrood, with what looks like a vengeance. \nHe'll accuse his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, of repeatedly breaking the rules for ministers in her handling of harassment complaints against him. \nHe'll point the finger at those in the Scottish government and the SNP - both of which he used to lead - that he believes plotted against him. \nHe'll allege that Scotland's prosecution service has assisted them by improperly withholding information that could back up his conspiracy claims. \nThis is his opportunity to convince MSPs his allegations have substance and are not the \"alternative reality\" Ms Sturgeon thinks he has created. \nInstead of commanding the main chamber as he did as first minister, today Alex Salmond will appear as a witness before a parliamentary committee.\nGiven the enormity of his allegations, his four-hour evidence session will be one of the most notable contributions in Holyrood's short history. \nThe Scottish Parliament inquiry was set up after the government admitted its investigation of two harassment complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful.\nAn internal probe had upheld the complaints - which dated back to when he was first minister - but the decision report was torn up after the government conceded in court that the investigation had been \"procedurally unfair\" and \"tainted by apparent bias\".\nMr Salmond was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses following the judicial review case, and was subsequently acquitted of sexual assault charges in a separate High Court trial.\nThe inquiry session will see Mr Salmond give an opening statement, and then take questions from the MSPs on the committee for up to four hours.\nThe group consists of four SNP MSPs - one of whom, Deputy Presiding Officer Linda Fabiani, acts as convener - as well as two from the Scottish Conservatives, one from each of Scottish Labour and the Lib Dems, and independent MSP Andy Wightman, formerly of the Greens.\nThe committee has frequently been at odds with the key players in the row, having complained of \"obstruction\" and submissions which provide \"very few clear answers\".\nThe Podlitical team break down the latest developments in the Alex Salmond saga as his row with Nicola Sturgeon escalates, and look ahead to his long-awaited appearance at the inquiry.\nYou can listen to the latest episode here or wherever you get your podcasts.\nThere has also been a lengthy row over whether one of Mr Salmond's submissions - which accuses Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code - could be published at all.\nMembers twice voted against publishing it at all due to legal issues, before Holyrood's cross-party management board intervened to say it could be. However, the Crown Office then raised \"grave concerns\" about its contents, and the paper was taken off the parliament's website and redacted - forcing yet another delay to Mr Salmond's long-awaited session.\nThe committee has agreed to apply to the High Court for \"specific guidance\" about what can and cannot be published, and to attempt to requisition further documents linked to Mr Salmond's criminal trial from the Crown Office.\nMs Sturgeon is due to give evidence on Wednesday, 3 March - which she said was the sixth date she had now had in her diary to face the committee."

      "title": "UK Covid alert level drops as NHS threat 'recedes'",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's coronavirus alert level has been lowered from level five to four in all four nations as the risk that the NHS could be overwhelmed \"has receded\".\nThe four UK chief medical officers and NHS England's national medical director agreed the change following advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre.\nThe alert level had moved to level five on 4 January, shortly before England and Scotland began fresh lockdowns.\nThe top medics urged people to \"remain vigilant\" by following lockdown rules.\nA change in the alert level does not automatically mean restrictions can ease, but it helps to inform government decisions on the rules.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have this week set out their separate plans to lift lockdown restrictions. Northern Ireland and Wales will outline their plans in the coming weeks.\nEngland's Prof Chris Whitty, Northern Ireland's Dr Michael McBride, Scotland's Dr Gregor Smith, Wales's Dr Frank Atherton and NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said their decision to reduce the alert level was made because the number of cases in hospital was \"consistently declining\".\nHowever, they warned: \"We should be under no illusions - transmission rates, hospital pressures and deaths are still very high.\"\nThey said the vaccine rollout would eventually have \"a major impact\" but for the time being \"it is really important that we all - vaccinated or not - remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidelines\".\nProf Whitty added in a tweet: \"If we continue to follow the guidance, cases will continue to fall.\"\nA further 9,985 new coronavirus cases were reported in the UK in Thursday's daily figures, as well as 323 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nThe coronavirus alert level, unveiled by the UK government in May 2020, is measured by a five-level, colour-coded system.\nLevel five (red), the highest level, is when there is a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\" within 21 days, and extremely strict social distancing is enforced.\nLevel four indicates a high or rising level of transmission, with social distancing still enforced.\nThe UK's alert level dropped down to level three in June 2020. During the summer, restrictions were gradually relaxed to allow people to socialise in groups indoors, and much of society reopened, including pubs and restaurants.\nHowever, the alert level was moved back up to level four in September as case numbers began to climb again. The same month a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus was detected in Kent. \nAs cases spiralled across the UK, the country moved to the highest level, level five, on 4 January.\nThe move to alert level five was made because the chief medical officers were worried the NHS was at risk of being overwhelmed.  \nIt was an announcement that essentially forced England's third national lockdown. \nBut since the number of cases peaked at over 39,000 in mid-January, cases have fallen rapidly. \nIn fact, the numbers of new admissions coming in each day are not far off what you would normally get for respiratory illnesses in winter.  \nBut while the immediate threat is over, hospitals are still incredibly busy. There are over 16,000 patients with Covid in hospital - that's only around 25% lower than the total in the peak of the first wave.  \nOperating theatres continue to be used as temporary critical care areas and non-urgent care is being cancelled in some places. \nBut with infection levels still coming down, we know this will ease further, hence the move to level four. \nThe Joint Biosecurity Centre, set up by the government in spring last year, has the task of recommending what the alert level should be, based on:\nThe centre's scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said despite the UK's alert level dropping, there was a \"long way to go yet\" and that no-one from the health service was \"anywhere near declaring this phase of battle won\".\nMeanwhile, new NHS England figures suggest one in five adults in England under the age of 70 have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nAn estimated 20.3% of people between the ages of 16 and 69 had been given their first jab as of 21 February, the figures say.\nHowever, the figures highlight some regional variations, with at least one in four over-70s yet to receive their first dose in several parts of London.\nMore than 18 million people have had a first vaccine dose - equivalent to one in three adults in the UK.\nThe vaccine rollout has entered its next phase, after everyone in the top four priority groups was offered a jab.\nMany areas are now offering vaccine appointments to over-60s, adult carers of disabled people and younger adults in care homes."

      "text": "Some areas of the UK are \"burning quite hot\" with rising levels of new coronavirus infections, England's deputy chief medical officer says. \nAlthough coronavirus levels are still decreasing across much of the UK, there are hotspots that buck the trend. \nThese are in the Midlands and east and west coast of England and some parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam told Friday's Downing Street briefing the battle is not yet won.\nHe warned people not to wreck it by relaxing the rules too early. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the aim was still to come out of lockdown together as a nation, but did not rule out measures being imposed locally if needed. The differences between areas now are smaller than those seen in the autumn.\nProf Van-Tam said: \"In some parts of the UK, case rates are changing, albeit slowly, in the wrong direction.\n\"This is not a good sign and reinforces the fact that I'm afraid this battle at the moment is not won.\"\nThe latest R number - 0.6 to 0.9 - suggests infection numbers are shrinking overall in the UK. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 6 and 9 other people.\nHospital pressures and deaths are still high, however, despite the UK's coronavirus alert level having been lowered from the maximum five to four. \nAnother 345 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 122,415, or 135,613 if you include death certificates that mention Covid-19. \nThere were 15,485 patients in hospital with coronavirus on 24 February 2021. \nPeople are still being advised to take precautions to stop the spread. There is still lots of the virus circulating.\nLatest ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nMeanwhile, the chair of Britain's Covid vaccine advice committee says the next phase of the vaccine rollout should focus on age groups rather than occupations.\nIt means people aged 40-49 will be the next in line to get a vaccine from mid-April, after all vulnerable groups and the over-50s are covered.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the priority was to deploy vaccines as quickly as possible to protect lives, and that targeting occupational groups would be more complex and may slow the rollout. \nLatest figures show 19,177,555 people in the UK have received a first dose of Covid vaccine and 736,037 have been given a second dose."

      "title": "Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon?",
      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon of breaking the ministerial code and misleading parliament. \nHe believes senior people around Scotland's first minister were part of a malicious attempt to have him removed from public life and ultimately jailed.\nMs Sturgeon has dismissed the claims and said he has no evidence. \nThe crisis could have significant implications for Scottish politics. \n\"He's trying to bring the house down.\" That was the conclusion of one of Ms Sturgeon's close allies shortly after it emerged Mr Salmond was publicly accusing her of misleading the Scottish Parliament and breaking the ministerial code.\nFor months, some around Scotland's first minister hoped Mr Salmond would hold back from directly criticising Ms Sturgeon in a way which could threaten her job. \nThey believed directly attacking Ms Sturgeon would alienate supporters of Scottish independence - something Mr Salmond would want to avoid. \nThat calculation changed with Mr Salmond's submission to an inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. \nThe picture above was taken days before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon were the dream team of the pro-indy movement.\nFor a decade, as leader and deputy leader, the pair had dominated nationalist politics.\nWhen Mr Salmond stood down, there was no question of who would take over: Ms Sturgeon was the natural successor.\nThat relationship collapsed completely as a result of sexual allegations later made against Mr Salmond.\nWhen the complaints emerged, Mr Salmond successfully took Ms Sturgeon's Scottish government to court over its process for investigating him. That process, it was found, was unlawful and \"tainted by apparent bias\".\nMr Salmond's victory cost the taxpayer at least \u00a3500,000.\nThe former first minister then stood trial accused of sexual assault - and was cleared of all charges. \nNow it is Ms Sturgeon and her government facing questions over the handling of complaints against Mr Salmond. \nThe former first minister of Scotland has made extraordinary allegations against the Scottish government and SNP - two institutions he used to lead. \nHe has claimed the process set up by the Scottish government, under which he was investigated, was unfair. \nMr Salmond alleges there was a malicious and concerted effort among a range of individuals to damage his reputation - and even to have him sent to jail. \nHe names people he believes helped to damage his reputation - including Ms Sturgeon's husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell and her Scottish government chief of staff, Liz Lloyd.\nAnd he has made serious allegations against the first minister too, arguing she has not told the truth about meetings with him, that she misled parliament and that she broke the code which governs the behaviour of ministers. \nA lot of the controversy surrounds what Ms Sturgeon knew and when - and accounts she gave publicly.\nMs Sturgeon originally said she first found out about a complaint against Mr Salmond, being investigated by her Scottish government, on 2 April 2018.\nThat meeting took place in her home and was not recorded. \nBut it has since been claimed Ms Sturgeon was told a few days earlier at the Scottish Parliament by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff.\nThat's raised questions over what Ms Sturgeon knew, why she met Mr Salmond privately and why it wasn't recorded as official government business. \nIt is not simply a question of a few days difference - it is a question of whether the second meeting should have been reported and treated as Scottish government businesses if Ms Sturgeon had indeed known what it was about in advance. \nMy colleague Phil Sim has written about the ins and outs of meetings here. \nMr Salmond has also made claims that Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code by not conceding earlier that the Scottish government's process for investigating him was flawed. \nHe alleges it was clear the Scottish government would lose a judicial review months before it was conceded it court - something which cost the taxpayer money. \nThere are two inquiries into the Scottish government's alleged mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond.\nOne is by James Hamilton, the first minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code, into whether she has breached it.\nThe second is a cross-party Holyrood inquiry into how her government handled complaints about Mr Salmond.\nThis has been beset by legal difficulties - with significant delays to Mr Salmond's evidence being published. After senior MSPs decided it should be made public, the Crown Office, Scotland's public prosecution service, raised concerns which led to further changes. \nMr Salmond has accused Ms Sturgeon of holding positions which are \"simply untrue\", \"manifestly untrue\" and \"untenable\".\n\"Parliament has been repeatedly misled,\" Mr Salmond contends.\nThere are many in the SNP - including a small but loyal group of elected politicians - who believe there was a conspiracy against him which could lead to several key officials in the Scottish government and SNP standing down.\nSome include Ms Sturgeon in that group.  \nMs Sturgeon says this is all nonsense and denies breaking the ministerial code.\nHer spokesman has accused Mr Salmond of trying to deflect from complaints made by women about his behaviour - and accused her former mentor of \"spinning false conspiracy theories\".\nMs Sturgeon said this week: \"He appears to be suggesting some kind of conspiracy or concerted campaign against him, without a shred of evidence.\n\"If he can't substantiate it, it's time for him to stop making these claims.\"\nNicola Sturgeon's political opponents have struggled to land any political blows in recent months.\nPolls suggest support for the SNP is as high as ever - and that backing for Scottish independence has been rising.\nAlthough there have been criticisms of the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, polling suggests Scots are happy Ms Sturgeon is making the decisions - and not Boris Johnson.\nTo many in Scottish politics, it appears the biggest threat to Ms Sturgeon's position now comes from her predecessor.\nMr Salmond's claims that his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 failed to tell the Scottish Parliament the truth - and that she broke the ministerial code - are serious.\nIn normal times such a breach of the code would lead to a resignation.\nThe code is clear: \"Ministers who knowingly mislead the parliament will be expected to offer their resignation.\"\nMs Sturgeon's political opponents have insisted that if she is found to have breached the code, she will have to stand down.\nPrivately, although they're confident it won't come to that, some around the first minister have admitted she would not be able to survive such a finding from her adviser on the code.\nMany senior figures in Scotland in the devolution era have resigned for less.\nThere is also nervousness in the SNP about the impact of these allegations hitting the headlines just weeks ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections. \nAlthough most would argue that the public just isn't paying attention, some acknowledge a number of party activists side with Mr Salmond - as do a section of SNP voters. \nIf the SNP are going to win a majority, they will need to mobilise their support ahead of 5 May. \nSome are worried this situation - combined with increasingly public splits on other issues - might turn some voters off, and lead to some activists staying at home.\nFor months, well connected opposition figures have talked about this inquiry being a moment of real danger for Ms Sturgeon's leadership. \nThey believe it raises questions about whether her government can be trusted. \nBut while many in Scottish politics discuss Ms Sturgeon's future - very few people are confidently predicting her demise.\nThe main reason is the pandemic. \nMs Sturgeon has high approval ratings for her response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nScots seem to approve of the way she is trying to deal with the health emergency - and some believe voters would forgive a breach of the rules in the midst of a crisis.\nIt's a view I've heard from Ms Sturgeon's critics as much as her allies; that these are not normal times and the normal rules of politics don't apply.\nMr Salmond's supporters are reluctant to speak on the record.\nI'm told that some elected parliamentarians are afraid of the backlash they would get if they did.\nBut one source said: \"I think in normal times she would be a goner. But I don't think she is a goner because people are rightly focused on the pandemic and her handling of the pandemic has been great.\"\nThe second is independence. \nMs Sturgeon has led the SNP and the independence movement to a point where successive polls have suggested support for leaving the UK is now a majority view. \nIf the SNP win big in May, they will use it to demand another referendum, which many think they could win.  \nThere have been criticisms from some in the SNP about a lack of strategy to force another referendum, but most accept the first minister is a key asset for the independence movement. Many think she is one of the main reasons for increasing support for leaving the UK. \nIf the SNP lost its leader that could have an impact on support for independence.\nWhile a number of names have been discussed, there is no certain successor - definitely not with the same UK and international profile.\nMr Salmond's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry will be a remarkable moment in the history of the SNP; the leader who took the party to the brink of independence accusing the leader who could deliver it of misleading parliament.\nEven if Ms Sturgeon survives, Mr Salmond's allies believe others may be \"toast\"; including senior civil servants and advisers.\nBut senior allies of Ms Sturgeon still appear confident she will lead them into the next Scottish election and beyond.\nOne concluded: \"Is she going to get through this? Yes she is.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "First Minister Arlene Foster has said she has \"full confidence\" in NI Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride.\nIt comes after her party, the DUP, said health officials had been \"overcautious\" in recommending a phased return of NI schools.\nThe DUP had called for the executive to revisit the plan but Dr McBride said the medical evidence had not changed.\nHealth and education officials are to work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nOn Thursday, DUP Education Minister Peter Weir said his preferred option had been a full return to school on 8 March, and that he \"wanted answers\" from Dr McBride about why his advice remained against that.\nAll schools in England are to reopen on 8 March, but only a small number of pre-school, nursery and primary pupils will return in NI on that date.\nMr Weir said he did not want NI to be \"out of sync\" with the rest of the UK or \"second-class citizens\".\nHe said NI was in a similar position to England and it was therefore \"hard to square the circle of Michael McBride and Chris Whitty being on the same page,\" considering the medical advice on reopening schools was different in the two jurisdictions.\nEast Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson also criticised health officials on Thursday, comparing Health Minister Robin Swann to \"a poodle for an unaccountable chief medical officer\". \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was \"disrespectful\" and \"disgraceful\".\nMrs Foster said \"sometimes tweets would be better to be typed out and then deleted\", adding it was not language she would have used.\nAsked whether Dr McBride still had her support, Mrs Foster said he \"absolutely\" did.\n\"He has worked tirelessly, as indeed has the chief scientific adviser and deputy to bring us impartial advice and that's the key - impartial advice - then we as politicians have to decide on the best way forward.\n\"So absolutely Michael retains and will have my full confidence and that of my party.\" \nThere have been no changes to the staggered approach, initially agreed by the executive last week.\nBut Mrs Foster said health and education officials will work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nShe said ministers indicated a desire at Thursday's meeting to avoid primary one to primary three pupils, who are due to return on 8 March, having to \"revert back\" to remote learning for a week from 22 March.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said all ministers also recognised that it was important to get students back to classrooms quickly - but safely. \nUnder the current timetable, only pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school.\nIt looks pretty clear that at least part of the executive's plan is going to change, for the return of some primary school pupils at least.\nNo principal I spoke to thought it was a good idea to bring primary one to primary three pupils back for effectively nine days, given most schools are off on St Patrick's Day and to then send them home for a week of remote learning when years 12 to 14 are due to return.\nIt is probably one of the easier changes for the executive to make.\nHowever there is still significant uncertainty for other year groups who don't yet have a potential date as to when they might return.\nWhether there are major changes this side of Easter is hard to predict because obviously it will depend how ministers see the public health situation moving.\nMuch of the executive's discussions on Thursday focused on the proposed pathway-to-recovery blueprint.\nIt is understood ministers received a presentation from interim Head of the Civil Service, Jenny Pyper, who leads the executive's Covid-19 taskforce. \nLast week, the first and deputy first ministers said they would publish the plan on Monday 1 March.\nBut at Thurday's press conference, they said they wanted to ensure they \"got it right\", rather than prematurely publishing the document.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates, but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions on different sectors can be eased.\nMrs Foster said the executive would also take into consideration \"not only local data but emerging evidence from other jurisdictions too\".\n\"We will keep to the standard of reviewing the regulations every three weeks, and every time we look at things we'll hope we can move further,\" she added. \nIn England and Scotland, recovery plans have been published that include target dates for easing restrictions - but the respective governments have said lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April.\nMs O'Neill said she hoped work on the executive's plan would continue over the weekend.\nShe added that she wanted to see \"robust and co-ordinated quarantine measures\" in place for travel across the island of Ireland, as part of the executive's overall response to manage the route out of lockdown.\nNI's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nOn Thursday, five more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.\nThe department's coronavirus death toll now stands at 2,048.\nA further 281 new positive cases of the virus have also been recorded.\nThere are also 341 people being treated for Covid-19 in hospitals, with 44 of those patients being treated in intensive case units (ICU), of those patients in ICU, 32 are ventilated.\nThe department's latest figures also show 491,593 people in Northern Ireland have now received their first Covid-19 vaccine.\nSome 31,637 people have had both doses.\nThe rate of transmission for new cases in Northern Ireland is estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.05, according to the Department of Health.\nThere were 35 additional deaths reported in the Irish Republic, with 613 more cases confirmed.\nIt means there has been a total of 4,271 coronavirus-related deaths in the country, with 217,478 confirmed cases.\nAre you worried about the new variants of coronavirus in Northern Ireland? Maybe you want to know when you can get vaccinated?\nSend your questions to us.\nWe'll answer them live during Thursday's Coronavirus Catch-up with our Health Correspondent Marie-Louise Connolly.\nJoin us at 19:00 GMT on the BBC News NI website, iPlayer and BBC News NI Facebook Page.\nIf you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic.

      "tags": "Britney Spears",
      "text": "People who believe Britney Spears' father should not be overseeing her controversial conservatorship \"have it so wrong\", according to his lawyer.\nIn an interview with ABC News, Vivian Thoreen called Jamie Spears \"a fiercely loving, dedicated and loyal father\" who had stopped her from being exploited.\nJamie Spears was made his daughter's conservator in 2008 after concerns were raised about the star's mental health.\nA recent documentary has led to renewed scrutiny of her legal arrangements.\n\"I understand that every story needs a villain but people have it so wrong here,\" Ms Thoreen told ABC's Good Morning America on Thursday.\nShe said unnamed people had been \"harming and exploiting\" the singer and that Mr Spears had \"rescued\" her from \"a life-threatening situation\".\n\"Britney's assets were clearly being mismanaged and she was being taken advantage of financially by some of those around her,\" the lawyer continued.\nShe added that Mr Spears had \"collaborated\" with his daughter, now 39, so that she could \"live her life the way she wants, like a normal person\".\nA conservatorship is usually granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses.\nLast November the singer lost a legal attempt to remove her father's control over her estate, currently worth around $60m (\u00a343m), but in February this year a judge denied a request by Mr Spears to exert greater control over her finances.\nAccording to Ms Spears' lawyer, Britney and her father have no \"viable working relationship\" and have not spoken in a \"long while\".\nMs Thoreen stated otherwise, claiming they had spent time together last year and she had never voiced a wish to have him removed from the conservatorship.\n\"Early on in the pandemic they spent two weeks with other family members, hunkered down in Louisiana, and they spent a lot of time together,\" she told ABC News.\n\"In that time, Britney never expressed those words to her father. She's never asked him to step aside.\"\nShe said ABC News would have to \"ask Britney\" why her lawyer had stated otherwise.\nSpears' life and career has returned to the headlines due to the documentary Framing Britney Spears, which explores the celebrity and media culture at the time of her meteoric rise.\nAccording to her lawyer Samuel D Ingham, the singer will not perform as long as her father oversees her affairs.\nThe singer has said she is \"taking the time to learn and be a normal person\" and was \"simply enjoying the basics of everyday life\".\n\"No matter what we think we know about a person's life it is nothing compared to the actual person living behind the lens,\" she wrote on Instagram.\nIn a subsequent post, she said it was \"so much fun\" spending time with boyfriend Sam Asghari, \"especially when you don't have to do anything at all\".\nThe accompanying video showed Asghari, who has been dating Spears since 2016, giving her a piggy-back ride while out on a hike.\nEarlier this week former child star Mara Wilson expressed solidarity with the singer, saying she was a victim of a culture that \"builds girls up just to destroy them\".\nAnother hearing on Spears' conservatorship is due to take place in Los Angeles next month.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A gender-neutral makeover will see Mr Potato Head become the toy formerly known as Mr Potato Head.\nThe classic toy's branding is being \"reimagined for the modern consumer\", its US maker Hasbro announced on Thursday.\nFrom later this year, the toy - launched almost 70 years ago - will be named Potato Head on packaging.\nOther toy companies have taken similar decisions in recent years, breaking with traditional gender norms.\n\"Hasbro is making sure all feel welcome in the Potato Head world by officially dropping the Mr from the Mr Potato Head brand name and logo to promote gender equality and inclusion,\" Hasbro said of the name change.\nThe rebranded toy, which can be assembled with a selection of different body parts and clothes, will be released in autumn this year, Hasbro said.\nThe company said the toy will allow children \"to imagine and create their own Potato Head family\".\nHowever, in a later tweet on Thursday, the company said the Mr and Mrs Potato Head characters would still be available to buy, but didn't provide more details.\nMr Potato Head was one of the main characters in Toy Story, an animated film series produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures.\nIn those films, Mr Potato Head angrily reminds other toys to use his honorific in some scenes.\n\"That's Mr Potato Head to you, you back-stabbing murderer,\" the plastic spud said to Woody, the toy cowboy played by American actor Tom Hanks.\nThe rebrand has been seen as a progressive move by some and criticised as a PR stunt by others. \n\"There is movement around gender neutrality at the moment,\" Frederique Tutt, a toy industry analyst for the NPD Group told the BBC. \"It's something that Hasbro has been addressing, along with inclusivity.\"\nShe said the rebrand shows Hasbro is mindful of people who \"want to be gender-neutral, who want to choose\".\n\"So I guess that's where Mr Potato Head is going as well,\" Ms Tutt said.\nIn an interview with business magazine Fast Company, Hasbro general manager Kimberly Boyd said the Mr and Mrs brand was \"limiting when it comes to both gender identity and family structure\".\n\"Culture has evolved,\" she added.\nOthers were less enthused with the rebrand.\n\"Barbie must be renamed something more gender-neutral. This is imperative,\" conservative American commentator Ben Shapiro wrote in an apparently sarcastic tweet.\nMr Potato Head first went on sale in 1952. On the back of its success, Mrs Potato Head, along with traditional feminised accessories, was launched the following year.\nThe move follows other updates to classic brands, including Barbie, who was initially known for being tall, white and blonde but now comes in a range of ethnicities and body shapes.\nIn 2019, global toy giant Mattel released a line of gender-neutral dolls.\nAnd more female characters have been added to the Thomas the Tank Engine series."

And it means we can remain on track to meet our ambitious vaccination targets.\"\nHe said calls for people in specific occupations to be prioritised had been heard.\n\"The JCVI did consider this - however, it found there wasn't sufficient evidence to set specific occupations apart from the general population.\u00a0It also advised that the complexity of delivering this approach would slow down the pace of the vaccination roll-out,\" he added.\nHowever Laura Doel, director of NAHT Cymru, said that despite such complexity it was \"not a good enough reason not to prioritise the needs of committed professionals\".\n\"We call upon the Welsh Government to take a different view\u2026 front line staff should be protected now that those in the greatest danger have already been vaccinated,\" she said.\n\"They are being required to work with large groups of people who carry at least as much potential for infection as anyone else. \n\"Those groups often occupy confined and unventilated spaces for long periods of time with only rudimentary PPE.\"\nIn a joint statement, Wales' four chief constables - Carl Foulkes of North Wales Police, Mark Collins of Dyfed Powys Police, Pam Kelly of Gwent Police and Jeremy Vaughan of South Wales Police - said: \"We have repeatedly asked that policing be risk assessed so our officers and staff can be given due consideration, given the risks they take daily on behalf of us all.\n\"Police officers by the nature of their role have to go into different settings and come into contact with all high risk groups along with also being unable to social distance and on many occasions cannot maintain PPE as designed, given the physical role they have to undertake,\" they wrote.\n\"In addition they are being tasked with enforcing isolation and quarantine arrangements on the government's behalf on those they know have the virus.\"\nThe total number of people to have received their first dose of a Covid vaccine in Wales is 902,334 and 80,062 of those have had their second dose.\nIn a statement, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: \"It is encouraging that the UK Government has brought forward some of Wales' supply allocation.\n\"But from the information available to us at this point there are concerns with both the type of supply and the timing of its delivery.  \n\"We have always said that we could go even faster were the supply available.\""

The Associated Press said a woman had brought them to the Olympic Community Police Station in LA and the singer's representatives had confirmed they were hers. The woman appeared to be \"uninvolved and unassociated\" with the robbery, a police spokesman said.\nLady Gaga had offered $500,000 (\u00a3359,000) for their safe return but it is not clear if the reward has been claimed.\nThe star - whose real name is Stefani Germanotta - is currently in Rome working on a new Ridley Scott film, Gucci. In her first public reaction to the attack, Gaga tweeted on Friday: \"My heart is sick.\" \n\"I am praying my family will be whole again with an act of kindness. I will pay $500,000 for their safe return.\"\nAnd in another Twitter post, the singer wrote: \"I continue to love you Ryan Fischer, you risked your life to fight for our family. You're forever a hero.\"\nGaga is known to be extremely protective of her dogs, who have accompanied her to the American Music Awards and her 2017 Super Bowl Halftime show.\nFootage has emerged showing one of the suspects firing at Mr Fischer before making off with the dogs, Koji and Gustav.\nA third bulldog, named Miss Asia, ran away and was later recovered by police.\nThe dog walker was shot in the chest, according to reports in US media.\nHis family released a statement on Friday praising the medical staff who had been caring for him and saying they were confident for his full recovery, according to US media.\n\"We cannot possibly say enough to thank all of the first responders, nurses and doctors who have worked so tirelessly to care for Ryan,\" the statement said.\n\"Of course, we also want to thank Lady Gaga who has shown nothing but non-stop love and concern for Ryan and our family right from the outset. Ryan loves Gustavo and Koji as much as Lady Gaga does; so we join in her plea for their safe return.\"\nPolice said the attack happened at about 21:40 local time on 24 February, in the area of Sierra Bonita Avenue and Sunset Boulevard.\n\"The suspects approached the victim in a white Nissan Altima four door.

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to announce a \u00a3126m boost for traineeships in England in his Budget on Wednesday.\nThe scheme will include a new \"flexi-job\" apprenticeship that will enable apprentices to work with a number of different employers in one sector.\nUnemployment is at its highest level in almost five years, with younger and typically lower-paid workers bearing the brunt of job losses.\nMr Sunak said it was \"vital\" support continued to get people back into work.\nThe chancellor's boost to existing apprenticeship and traineeship programmes will include playing up to double the current cash incentive to firms who take on an apprentice, regardless of age.\nIt comes as a new government guarantee for low-deposit mortgages is announced as part of next week's measures. \nTraineeships are intended to get people into their first job after education. They last from six weeks to six months and they are open to people aged between 16 and 24.\nCurrently, firms in England are given \u00a32,000 for every new apprentice they take on under the age of 25, and \u00a31,500 for those over 25, in addition to a \u00a31,000 grant they are already getting under another project.\nMr Sunak will promise to increase the cash incentives for employers who take on an apprentice to \u00a33,000 - regardless of age.\nSo the government says the planned \u00a3126m investment could enable 40,000 more traineeships.\nWhile he is committed to helping jobseekers and employers, Mr Sunak warned in an interview with the Financial Times that the UK's finances were now \"exposed\".\n\"Because we now have far more debt than we used to and because interest rates\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009at least a month or two ago were exceptionally low, that means we remain exposed to changes in those rates,\" he said.\n\"That why I talk about levelling with people about the public finances [challenges] and our plans to address them.\"\nHe added that the UK's exposure to a rise of one percentage point across all interest rates meant adding \u00a325bn a year to the government's cost of servicing its debt.\nThe Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, welcomed the move, but said it would like to see reform of the apprenticeships system to make it more flexible.   \n\"Changing the apprenticeship levy to make it a flexible training levy would achieve a bigger boost to skills development than incentives alone,\" said Lizzie Crowley, skills adviser for the CIPD.\nShe stressed that awareness of traineeships is very low: \"Besides providing additional funding for placements, the government will have to do much more to market them to employers to boost uptake.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), which had previously called for flexi-job apprenticeships, said the increase in incentives for employers was \"important\", because the current level of support \"is not leading to enough starts\". \n\"It will be important in the budget to take wider action to support jobs, including on employers national insurance and reintroducing the jobs retention bonus,\" said the FSB's national chairman Mike Cherry.\n\"Going forward, the government should consider changing the timings of apprenticeship incentives.\""

There have been several cases, around the United States, sometimes involving violent assaults on their owners, where the animals have been stolen. \nIn January, a woman in San Francisco was attacked at gunpoint by three men who escaped with her five-month-old puppy. \nFrench bulldogs are hugely popular and in much demand, but they are notoriously difficult to breed. They require artificial insemination and the physical characteristics of the dog - a large head and shoulders - mean they usually have to be delivered by Caesarean section. \nThe breeding costs explain the price tag of a puppy, which can range from $2,000-$10,000.\nLos Angeles Police Department confirmed that they are searching for a man who \"fired a gunshot from an unknown location and struck the victim\" on North Sierra Bonita Avenue at 21:40 on Wednesday.\nA \"possible suspect\" fled the scene in a white vehicle towards Hollywood Boulevard, they added.\nIt is not clear whether Lady Gaga's dogs were specifically targeted in the attack.\nGaga is known to be extremely protective of her dogs, who have accompanied her to the American Music Awards and her 2017 Super Bowl Halftime show.\nMiss Asia even has an official Instagram account. \nYou may be interested in watching:\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Labour will put Wales \"at the forefront of the global energy revolution\" if the party wins the Senedd election in May, the party's Welsh leader has pledged.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford says Wales can use \"wind, water and wave\" to create \"the jobs of the future\".\nIn a pre-recorded speech to Welsh Labour's virtual spring conference, he also called for a \"more powerful devolution settlement\".\nMr Drakeford wants \"home rule for Wales in a successful United Kingdom\".\nLeader of Welsh Labour and first minister since December 2018, Mr Drakeford has already said he does not intend to serve a full term if he is reappointed after the election. \nIn his recorded address on Friday - shared publicly on social media - he said a Labour government would put the \"urgent need\" to tackle climate change \"at the heart of everything we do\".\n\"We are so lucky, in our country, to have all the natural resources we need to put Wales at the forefront of the global energy revolution which the world will need,\" Mr Drakeford said.\n\"Wind, water and wave - the next Welsh Labour Government will make those assets work to create the jobs of the future and, in doing so, make our contribution to securing the future of our beautiful but fragile planet.\"\nIn response to a growing debate around Wales' future in the UK, Mr Drakeford said: \"We need a more powerful devolution settlement, one in which we secure home rule for Wales in a successful United Kingdom - internationalist, not nationalist; outward facing, not inward looking.\"\nWith an apparent nod to the independence movement, he said: \"Yes for Wales, of course - that's what I have been throughout my whole life - but yes to a Wales that takes ownership of its own destiny alongside working people in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland who share our progressive values.\n\"Yes to a Wales which has the confidence of knowing that we are at our best when we break down barriers, not build them up, where we create our future alongside others, not despite or against them.\"\nOn Friday, Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales his party's manifesto would be both ambitious and credible.\n\"I'll be focusing on health because we will have to rebuild our health service post pandemic,\" he said. \n\"I'll be talking about jobs, particularly jobs for our young people, because this is an economic crisis as well as a health crisis.\n\"And I'll be talking about justice as well, so that we come out of all of this in a way that is fairer.\" \nMr Drakeford said he was \"absolutely determined there will be no lost generation in Wales\".\nHe added that if Labour wins the election he would remain as first minister for \"beyond two years\".\n\"When I first stood as a candidate for the leadership of the Labour Party... I said then that I expected to serve for around five years,\" he told Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"So, if we are fortunate enough to win the confidence of Welsh people again... I will be the first minister in the full sense of that word.\n\"That's the plan that I had in the beginning - that's the plan I intend to stick to.\" \nLabour has been in government in Wales since devolution began in 1999, forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2000 and Plaid Cymru in 2007.\nThe party won 29 of the 60 seats in the 2016 Senedd election and governs with the support of Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams and independent member Lord Elis-Thomas. \nLabour lost six Welsh seats to the Conservatives at the last UK general election in 2019.\nThe Senedd election is due to take place on 6 May, although a law has been passed in light of the pandemic to allow a delay of up to six months if two-thirds of members think it necessary for safety or other reasons.\nIn this speech Mark Drakeford is trying to address some of the big issues in the forthcoming election.\nFirstly, the \"it's time for a change\" argument that will be made by Labour's opponents - the party has been in power in Wales for 20 plus years. \nSo he says it's only his team who have been \"tested in the fire of experience\" of governing through the Covid pandemic, which is \"far from over\".\nSecondly independence, which has risen up the political agenda recently.\nHe uses the phrase \"Yes for Wales\" to tell left-wing voters thinking of turning to Plaid or the Greens that he wants to get more powers for Welsh devolution (\"home rule\") but he balances that by referencing traditional socialist concerns about working class solidarity across the UK. \nAnd finally, he turns his fire power on the Conservative government in Westminster, presenting Welsh Labour as a bulwark against \"inequality and austerity\"."

      "text": "Shamima Begum will not be allowed to return to the UK to fight the decision to remove her citizenship, the Supreme Court has ruled.\nSo, who is she and why was her citizenship taken away?\nMs Begum is one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in February 2015 and supported the Islamic State group (IS). She was born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage and was 15 when she left.  \nMs Begum travelled via Turkey to IS headquarters in Raqqa, where she married a Dutch recruit who is the father of her children.  \nMs Begum, now 21, lived under IS rule for more than three years. \nShe was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019. The baby later died of pneumonia and Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children.\nAfter she was found, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, cancelled her British citizenship on security grounds. \nYou can appeal in court against such a decision. Ms Begum did so, and the Court of Appeal ruled that she should be allowed to return to the UK to make her case because she could not do so from a dangerous camp in northern Syria. \nHowever, the Home Office then argued allowing her to return would create \"significant national security risks\". The Supreme Court has now ruled the government was entitled to prevent Ms Begum from returning to the UK to fight her case - but it also ordered that the legal battle over her citizenship should be paused until she can find a way to take part in it.\nOne of the other girls who travelled with her, Kadiza Sultana, was reportedly killed in a bombing raid, but the fate of the third - Amira Abase - is unknown.\nCitizenship is the right to live in a country.\nIn the UK, citizens have rights to things like welfare, education and healthcare. They can also vote.\nThere are also people who have the right to live in the UK permanently with the same rights, but who are not citizens. \nYou might become a British citizen if:\nIn the year to the end of March 2020, 163,624 people were granted British citizenship.\nIn common with many countries, the UK allows people to be citizens of more than one country.\nIn the UK, someone can have their citizenship stripped by the home secretary, for the following reasons: \nMs Begum was stripped of her citizenship for the public good reason.\nThe UK has responsibilities under international law to avoid people being left stateless. But in February 2020, a tribunal ruled that removing Ms Begum's citizenship was lawful because she was \"a citizen of Bangladesh by descent\".\nBut Bangladesh has said that is not the case and she would not be allowed into the country.\nIn many cases removing citizenship involves threats to national security, such as terrorism, or serious organised crime. \nBritish citizens can also have their passports taken away. \nMany foreigners who travelled to Iraq and Syria to join IS did so secretly.\nBut data from King's College estimates that 52,808 men, women and children travelled to (or were born into) the areas of Iraq and Syria under IS control between 2013 and 2018.\nIn July 2019 it estimated that about a fifth had returned home or were trying to do so.\nSome countries such as Russia and the Central Asian states have taken back hundreds of their nationals. But Western European countries have generally taken back far fewer, and those they have allowed to return are often children. \nThere are also thought to be several hundred women and children from EU countries who have made their own way back.\nAfter fighters travelled to Syria and Iraq, many countries changed or introduced anti-terrorism laws. \nMost EU countries now manage the return of IS fighters through \"criminal investigation and prosecution\", according to a European Parliament report.\nCountries also use deradicalisation programmes to challenge their views. \nThey may also seize identity cards and passports, or restrict travel. \nChild returnees are generally seen by child care professionals, or placed in juvenile detention."

      "text": "With children in England back in the classroom, teachers face the massive task of making up for months of missed learning.\nA \u00a3720m package has been announced to help pupils in England catch up - although teachers' unions say more is needed. \nHere are some of the measures which could be used to help pupils.\nThe government has asked schools to consider offering face-to-face learning over the summer holidays this year.\nIt is to provide \u00a3200m to secondary schools to fund summer classes for pupils who need it most, especially those children moving up to Year 7.\nSummer schools with qualified teachers leading small groups can help children make up to four months of academic progress, according to the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). \nThey need a strong academic element, chief executive Becky Francis says, although sporting and other fun activities can also contribute to children's emotional wellbeing.\nShe adds: \"Staffing summer schools will be a challenge because of burnout among teachers.\"\nThe government's education catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, has said that the idea of summer schools has \"promise\".\nAnd Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was \"willing to discuss all possibilities\" for keeping schools open over the summer. \nHowever, evidence suggests that disadvantaged pupils, who would benefit the most, are less likely to take up the offer.\nTwo summer school trials run by the EEF saw less than 50% attendance among students in the target group.\nOne-to-one tuition is seen as a proven method of helping children catch up. \nWeekly sessions could help a student make three to six months of academic progress, with particularly large gains in literacy and numeracy among primary-school pupils, according to four recent UK studies.\nThe government is pledging money to an expanded National Tutoring Programme (NTP) for primary and secondary pupils, and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds. \nMore than 100,000 disadvantaged pupils have accessed the service since it began, in November.\nBut the NTP has largely offered online tuition since January, and many of the tutors are university students. \nProf Lee Elliott Major, from the University of Exeter, who first proposed the scheme, early last year, says: \"The evidence is thin about tutoring done online not by professionals.\n\"So the exact impact of the NTP is unclear at the moment.\"\nThe practice of retaking a whole year is common in some countries, such as Germany and the US, but rare in the UK.\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank has suggested it could help pupils whose education has fallen behind.\nBut the Association of School and College Leaders says the idea would be practical for a small number of students only.\nLarge-scale repetition would create \"a log-jam in the system\" and have huge knock-on effects on funding for universities.\nThe EEF estimates it would cost \u00a36,000 per pupil per year in England.\nAnd pupils who repeat a year make an average of four months' less academic progress than those at a similar level who continue on to the next school year, research suggests.\nDisadvantaged pupils can benefit from longer school days, US research suggests.\nAnd Robert Halfon, who chairs the Education Select Committee, told BBC News he had suggested the idea as \"a serious solution for the government to consider\" in England. \nThe extra teaching time could be provided by \"civil society instead of teachers\", he says. \nAfter-school clubs cost about \u00a37 a session, the EEF estimates.\nBut adding two extra weeks of school time a year would cost \u00a3260 per primary pupil and \u00a3360 per secondary pupil. \nThere have been calls for extra funding for mental health support for schoolchildren, to help ease their return to the classroom and improve their chances of catching up.\nTeaching staff trained to improve emotional wellbeing can help pupils make substantial attainment progress, EEF research suggests.\nAnd the EPI has proposed \u00a3650m of extra funding for additional school staff and in-school counselling programmes in England.\n\"Remedial wellbeing work will be necessary to achieve [academic] catch-up,\" it says, particularly for disadvantaged pupils."

      "text": "A US intelligence report has found that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the murder of exiled Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\nThe report released by the Biden administration says the prince approved a plan to either \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi.\nThe US announced sanctions on dozens of Saudis but not the prince himself. \nSaudi Arabia rejected the report, calling it \"negative, false and unacceptable\". \nCrown Prince Mohammed, who is effectively the kingdom's ruler, has denied any role in the murder. \nKhashoggi was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and his body cut up.\nThe 59-year-old journalist had once been an adviser to the Saudi government and close to the royal family but he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017.\nFrom there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Prince Mohammed.\n\"We assess that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,\" the report by the office of the US director of national intelligence says. \nThe crown prince is the son of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud and is considered to be the effective ruler of the kingdom. \nThe intelligence report lists three reasons for believing that the crown prince must have approved the operation:\nThe report goes on to name individuals allegedly complicit in, or responsible for, Khashoggi's death. But it says \"we do not know how far in advance\" those involved planned to harm him. \nSaudi authorities have blamed the killing on a \"rogue operation\" by a team of agents sent to return the journalist to the kingdom, and a Saudi court tried and sentenced five individuals to 20 years in prison last September, after initially sentencing them to death.\nIn 2019, UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard accused the Saudi state of the \"deliberate, premeditated execution\" of Khashoggi and dismissed the Saudi trial as an \"antithesis of justice\". \nShortly after the report was released, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the travel restrictions, dubbed the \"Khashoggi Ban\".\nThose targeted are \"believed to have been directly engaged in serious, extraterritorial counter-dissident activities\", he said.\n\"Perpetrators targeting perceived dissidents on behalf of any foreign government should not be permitted to reach American soil,\" he warned.\nIn addition, the treasury department sanctioned some of those around the crown prince: one of his close aides, former deputy intelligence chief Ahmad Asiri, as well as his personal protective force, which was involved in the killing.\nAs far back as 2018, the CIA reportedly believed that the crown prince had ordered the murder but the allegation that he was involved has never been made publicly by US officials until now.\nSaudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, is a key American ally in the Middle East.\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to take a firmer line than his predecessor Donald Trump on human rights and the rule of law in Saudi Arabia.\nIn a phone call on Thursday with King Salman, the president \"affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law\", the White House said.\nAccording to sources quoted by Reuters news agency, the Biden administration is also considering the cancellation of arms deals with Saudi Arabia that pose human rights concerns as well as the limiting of future military sales to \"defensive\" weapons. \nDismissing the US report, the Saudi foreign ministry insisted that those responsible for the crime had been properly investigated and justice had been served.    \n\"It is truly unfortunate that this report, with its unjustified and inaccurate conclusions, is issued while the Kingdom had clearly denounced this heinous crime, and the Kingdom's leadership took the necessary steps to ensure that such a tragedy never takes place again,\" it added.\nIt further rejected \"any measure that infringes upon its leadership, sovereignty, and the independence of its judicial system\".\nThe public blaming of Mohammed bin Salman is an extraordinary rebuke but so far he has escaped sanction despite calls from activists, Democrats in congress and the UN Special Rapporteur, Agnes Callamard. \nThe carefully calibrated moves reflect the fine line that President Biden is treading: he wants to act on his promise to hold Saudi Arabia to account for human rights abuses but he also wants to preserve ties with the kingdom because it plays a role in the Mid-East issues that matter to the US, such as ending the war in Yemen, re-engaging Iran, fighting Islamist extremism and advancing Arab-Israeli ties. \nThe president has made clear, though, that unlike his predecessor Donald Trump, he will not have direct contact with Prince Mohammed.\nInstead Mr Biden is dealing with his father, King Salman. \nKhashoggi went to the consulate in October 2018 in order to obtain papers allowing him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e. \nHe had allegedly received assurances from the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, who was ambassador to the US at the time, that it would be safe to visit the consulate. Prince Khalid has denied any communication with the journalist.\nAccording to Saudi prosecutors, Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death. \nHis body was then dismembered and handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the consulate, prosecutors said. The remains were never found.\nDetails were revealed in transcripts of purported audio recordings of the killing obtained by Turkish intelligence."

      "text": "The National Trust is planning to plant dozens of blossoming trees, including cherry, hawthorn and plum, at different sites around the UK.\nAs part of the plan, a circle of 33 trees will be planted across the capital, one representing each borough and the City of London.\nDesigns are being finalised for groves in Nottingham, Newcastle and Plymouth - and other sites will follow.\nThe project will help improve access to nature for those in towns and cities.\nThe idea is to try to create a UK equivalent of Japan's concept of \"Hanami\" - the annual celebration of flowers, and the coming of spring.\nResearch carried out for the National Trust last year showed that almost half a million people live in  \"grey deserts \" with no trees or green spaces nearby.\nHilary McGrady, director general of the Trust, said the project was in its infancy, but \"from little acorns great things grow\". \nShe added: \"I want this to be just as valid as planting vast tracts of trees on mountains - it's just as valid for every individual to want to plant a tree in their garden or their city. \n\"At the heart of it, now more than ever, people need a little bit of soft beauty in their world, and remembering why nature matters.\" \nAccording to numerous studies carried out after the first lockdown, being around nature is crucial to people's mental and physical health. \nHowever, according to conservation group WWF, the UK is one of the most \"nature depleted countries in the world\". \nMs McGrady said the National Trust would be calling on the government to create solid commitments to protecting the natural world, ahead of hosting the global climate conference - known as COP 26 - in November. \n\"We need them to start to put money and action where their mouths are - we need some tangible targets. We want, by 2030, for the government to have halted the decline in nature. We have every opportunity to hold their feet to the fire,\" she told BBC News.\nMs McGrady added: \"Covid has taught us lots of lessons, including the importance of nature. The public are behind it.\"\nThe project, part-funded by the People's Postcode Lottery, and supported by Historic England, will begin at a site in London. There are other plans for circles in Plymouth, Newcastle, Nottingham and other sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe National Trust's London Blossom Garden is being planted in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Newham. It's in the same borough as the temporary NHS Nightingale Covid-19 hospital. The local community was involved in the design.\nIt's designed to be a \"commemorative space\" to reflect on the impact Covid-19 has had on the capital. \nLondon's Mayor Sadiq Khan explained: \"This new public garden will create a lasting, living memorial to commemorate all those who have lost their lives in the pandemic. It will be a tribute to the amazing ongoing work of our key workers and create a space for Londoners to contemplate and reflect on all this global pandemic has meant to our city and world.\"\nThe nascent plan for a circle in Newcastle is supported by Newcastle City Council and Urban Green Newcastle (UGN). \nBarbara Hooper, UGN's director for parks and allotments, said: \"The events of the past year have highlighted more than ever how important it is for us all to have access to green space.  Somewhere for us to breathe fresh air, connect with nature, and find solace during difficult times.\"\nFollow Claire on Twitter."

      "tags": "Scottish government,NHS Scotland,Doctors,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It will be \"impossible\" for NHS Scotland to recover from the pandemic if senior staff cannot be retained, a medical body has warned.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) Scotland said vacancies for consultants may now be higher than 15%.\nDoctors were also reporting \"widespread burnout\" even before the Covid crisis hit, according to the association.\nThe Scottish government said the number of consultants had increased by more than 56% since 2006.\nA spokesperson added that there was a \"record high\" of 5,702 whole time equivalent consultants currently employed by NHS Scotland.\nBMA Scotland is calling for urgent action from the Scottish government to stop what it called a \"deeply worrying drain of senior doctors out of the workforce\".\nA report published by the trade union found one in five consultants who were aged 45-49 in 2010 had left the profession by 2020 - with early retirement being the most likely destination.\nThe BMA also said that freedom of information requests indicated that the actual vacancy rate for doctors was at least twice the government's official figure.\nDr Graeme Eunson, chairman of the BMA's Scottish consultants committee, described the findings as \"extremely worrying\" and argued staff shortages were \"already affecting the ability of doctors to deliver the high-quality patient care they strive for\".\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that staff were exhausted from going from winter 2019 straight into the Covid-19 pandemic early last year, with no time to recover between the first and second waves, and were now running on empty. \nDr Eunson said that doctors were leaving quicker than their replacements could be trained - and said it took 15 years to train as a consultant. \nWithout adequate staffing, he stressed that patient care would suffer. \nDoctors had been reporting widespread burnout and an array or workforce and workplace pressures long before the pandemic hit last year, he said.\nAnd the specialities that faced the biggest staff shortages were those that faced the biggest pressure from Covid. \nHe added that this came on top of \"a general increase in the intensity of work\" for doctors over the years. \nHe said long working hours had followed them through their entire career, and that there was little recognition of the burnout these medics faced. \n\"As you get older, the shifts get harder - you're either doing everything or nothing,\" he said.  \nHe added that large tax bills drove people out at the end of their career. \nHe called for a \"portfolio career approach\", so doctors could wind down - for example, by cutting back on shifts - but still care for patients. \nIf the matter was not addressed urgently, he said the country would end up \"storing up problems\" for the future. \nThe Scottish government said it was committed to improving the wellbeing of health and social care staff across Scotland and had taken \"immediate action\" to provide support while they responded to the pandemic.\n\"We are also working to build a sustainable culture that will continue to prioritise staff wellbeing in the future,\" a spokesperson said."

      "tags": "Antarctic,Earth observation,Icebergs,British Antarctic Survey",
      "text": "A big iceberg approaching the size of Greater London has broken away from the Antarctic, close to Britain's Halley research station. \nSurface instruments on the Brunt Ice Shelf confirmed the split early on Friday. \nThere is currently no-one in the base, so there is no risk to human life.\nThe British Antarctic Survey has been operating Halley in a reduced role since 2017 because of the imminent prospect of a calving.\nThe berg has been measured to cover 1,270 sq km - nearly 490 square miles. Halley is positioned just over 20km from the line of rupture.  \nBAS has an array of GPS devices on the Brunt. These relay information about ice movements back to the agency's HQ in Cambridge. \nScientists will be inspecting satellite imagery as it becomes available.\nThey will want to see that no unexpected instabilities emerge in the remaining ice shelf platform that holds Halley.\nProf Adrian Luckman has been tracking satellite images of the Brunt in recent weeks and predicted the calving.\n\"Although the breaking off of large parts of Antarctic ice shelves is an entirely normal part of how they work, large calving events such as the one detected at the Brunt Ice Shelf on Friday remain quite rare and exciting,\" the Swansea University remote-sensing expert said.\n\"With three long rifts actively developing on the Brunt Ice Shelf system over the last five years, we have all been anticipating that something spectacular was going to happen. \n\"Time will tell whether this calving will trigger more pieces to break off in the coming days and weeks. At Swansea University we study the development of ice shelf rifts because, while some lead to large calving events, others do not, and the reasons for this may explain why large ice shelves exist at all,\" he told BBC News.\nIt is on the Brunt Ice Shelf, which is the floating protrusion of glaciers that have flowed off the land into the Weddell Sea. On a map, the Weddell Sea is that sector of Antarctica directly to the south of the Atlantic Ocean. The Brunt is on the eastern side of the sea. Like all ice shelves, it will periodically calve icebergs. The last major chunk to have come off in this area was in the early 1970s. \nAbsolutely. Scientists continuously monitor any major cracks in the Brunt, and have been following the propagation of quite a few in recent years. Indeed, it was an acceleration in the movement of these fissures that actually prompted BAS to relocate Halley \"upstream\" in the flow of ice in 2016/17. All the major cracks converge on a location known as the McDonald Ice Rumples. This is a pinning point - a section of shallow sea floor - that the Brunt must grind past. One particular crack, called the North Rift, spread out from the rumples to draw the outline of the berg that has now calved. \nEstimates put it at around 1,270 sq km. Greater London is about 1,500 sq km; the Welsh county of Monmouthshire is roughly 1,300 sq km. That's big by any measure, although not as large as the monster A68 berg which calved in July 2017 from the Larsen C Ice Shelf on the western side of the Weddell Sea. But even at a quarter of the size of A68, the Brunt block will need to be tracked because of the future risk it could pose to shipping. The US National Ice Center will give the new berg a designation in due course. Because it is in the same Antarctic quadrant (0-90W) as A68's origin, the Brunt berg will also carry the letter \"A\" in its name. It's likely to be called A74.\nBAS director Dame Jane Francis commented: \"Our teams at BAS have been prepared for the calving of an iceberg from the Brunt Ice Shelf for years. We monitor the ice shelf daily using an automated network of high-precision GPS instruments that surround the station, these measure how the ice shelf is deforming and moving.  We also use satellite images from the European Space Agency, Nasa and the German satellite TerraSar-X.  \n\"All the data are sent back to Cambridge for analysis, so we know what's happening even in the Antarctic winter, when there are no staff on the station and it's pitch black.\"\nNo. The calving of bergs at the forward edge of an ice shelf is a very natural behaviour. A shelf will maintain an equilibrium and the ejection of bergs is one way it balances the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land. Unlike on the Antarctic Peninsula on the other side of the Weddell Sea, scientists have not detected climate changes in the Brunt region that would significantly alter the natural process described above. What is more - estimates suggest the Brunt was at its biggest extent in at least 100 years before the calving. The event was overdue.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"

      "text": "Shamima Begum, who left the UK for Syria to join the Islamic State group as a teenager, will not be allowed to return and fight her citizenship case, the Supreme Court has ruled.\nThe court said in a unanimous ruling that her rights were not breached when she was refused permission to return.\nMs Begum, 21, wants to come back to challenge the home secretary's decision to remove her British nationality.\nShe is currently in a camp controlled by armed guards in northern Syria.\nMs Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls left the UK in February 2015 and travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State group.\nIn 2019, the then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Ms Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds.\nLast July, the Court of Appeal ruled that the only fair way forward was to allow her into the UK because she could not effectively appeal against the decision from the camp in northern Syria.\nThe Home Office subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court to reconsider the Court of Appeal's judgement, arguing that allowing her to return to the UK \"would create significant national security risks\".\nOn Friday, Lord Reed, president of the Supreme Court, said the government had been entitled to prevent Ms Begum from returning to the UK.\nAnnouncing the ruling, Lord Reed said: \"The Supreme Court unanimously allows all of the home secretary's appeals and dismisses Ms Begum's cross-appeal.\" \nHe said the Court of Appeal's judgment \"did not give the home secretary's assessment the respect which it should have received\" given the role's \"responsibility for making such assessments\" and accountability to parliament.\nLord Reed added the Court of Appeal had \"mistakenly believed that, when an individual's right to have a fair hearing... came into conflict with the requirements of national security, her right to a fair hearing must prevail.\"\nHe said the right to a fair hearing did \"not trump all other considerations, such as the safety of the public\".\nShamima Begum says she wants forgiveness - but all she's achieved after two years of battles over her citizenship is legal limbo.\nThat's the extremely unusual outcome of her epic struggle against the home secretary over whether she can still call herself British.\nIt is the role of judges and the courts to uphold the rule of law - and protect the universal right that each of us has to make our case fairly in court. \nBut, when it comes to matters of national security - threats to the nation - judges won't tell ministers that their assessment is wrong unless they have heard compelling evidence to prove it.\nIn the Begum case, that means she is at the heart of an imperfect world of her own making. \nShe is stuck, with no right to return under the law. \nBut, at the same time, her lawyers maintain she can't take part in her own case to have her citizenship returned because of the uniquely dangerous situation she is in. \nOther people banned from the UK have found a way to take part in appeals from overseas - but the camp she is in won't even let her lawyers visit. \nAnd so the highest court in the land says her entire case must now be paused until she can find some way of taking part. \nAnd perhaps that will never, ever happen.\nLord Reed said the appropriate answer was not to force the government to bring Ms Begum back to the UK - but to pause her legal fight over citizenship until she is in a safer position to take part in her appeal. \nHe added: \"That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible. But there is no perfect solution to a dilemma of the present kind.\"\nThe current home secretary, Priti Patel, said the Supreme Court's judgement had \"reaffirmed the home secretary's authority to make vital national security decisions\".\nShe added: \"The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens.\"\nMs Begum was born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage.\nWhen she was 15, she and two other schoolgirls left the UK for Syria to join IS.\nMs Begum travelled via Turkey to IS headquarters in Raqqa, where she married a Dutch recruit.\nShe lived under IS rule for more than three years, and was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019. \nThe baby later died of pneumonia and Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children.\nYou can read more here.\nMr Javid also welcomed the ruling, saying any \"restrictions of rights and freedoms\" faced by Ms Begum were a \"direct\" result of her \"extreme\" actions.\nHe said: \"There are no simple solutions to this situation but any restrictions of rights and freedoms faced by this individual are a direct consequence of the extreme actions that she and others have taken, in violation of government guidance and common morality.\" \nLiberty, the human rights group which intervened in Ms Begum's case, said the latest ruling sets \"an extremely dangerous precedent\".\nRosie Brighouse, a lawyer with Liberty, said: \"The right to a fair trial is not something democratic governments should take away on a whim, and nor is someone's British citizenship.\n\"If a government is allowed to wield extreme powers like banishment without the basic safeguards of a fair trial it sets an extremely dangerous precedent.\n\"The security services have safely managed the returns of hundreds of people from Syria but the government has chosen to target Shamima Begum.\"\nMaya Foa, director of the human rights group Reprieve said preventing Ms Begum from entering the UK remained \"a cynical ploy to make her someone else's responsibility\".\n\"Like many of its European counterparts, the UK is more than capable of bringing home British detainees in Syria, many of whom left as teenagers after being trafficked or groomed online.\n\"Abandoning them in a legal black hole - in Guantanamo-like conditions - is out of step with British values and the interests of justice and security.\""

The couple are now married.\nEyamalai was also given a week's prison sentence. \nSingapore requires people to spend 14 days in a hotel upon arrival.\nEarlier this month, Skea had pleaded guilty to one charge of contravening a control order and one of failing to wear a face mask.\nCourt documents said Skea had left his quarantine room at the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore Hotel three times to visit Eyamalai, who had booked a room in the same hotel despite living in Singapore.\nEyamalai admitted a single charge of conspiring to contravene a control order.\nThe court heard Skea walked up 13 flights of stairs to spend the night with Eyamalai, who opened an emergency exit door for him. They spent nine hours together.\nSkea, from Southampton, had also been caught \"loitering in the corridor\" twice, according to the charges. \nSuranjana Tewari, BBC News, Singapore\nNigel Skea didn't react when the judge read out his sentence. His wife, however, let out a gasp when she heard she would spend one week in prison for abetting his crime. \nThe judge dismissed a number of previous cases that the defence cited, saying that Skea exposed hotel staff to risk with his actions.  She said it didn't matter that he stayed on the hotel premises even in the breach, he intentionally chose to breach his quarantine order from the moment he arrived at the hotel by texting his fianc\u00e9e at the time.  \nThe defence had argued that Skea had travelled to Singapore in order to propose and they were both overcome by emotions after not seeing each other for a very long time.  The judge said this was not a mitigating factor - restrictions are necessary to prevent the spread of the pandemic and  disruptions to relationships are an inevitable consequence.\nTheir lawyer said the couple had mixed feelings about the sentence but that they were pleased it was less than what the prosecution sought. He added that Skea does not plan on appealing, that he wants to \"finish the matter\" and go back to the UK and his job as soon as possible. \nSingapore has been been one of the most successful countries in tackling the pandemic. Despite a big outbreak among low-income migrant workers, many of whom are housed in large dormitories with cramped facilities, local infection rates have for months been low.\nLast June, a group of British men living in Singapore were banned from working there again after breaking lockdown to go on a \"bar crawl\".\nThey were also fined around S$9,000 each ($6,800; \u00a34,893).\nBriton jailed for breaking Singapore quarantine"

      "text": "Online booking platform Airbnb has said it is preparing for a \"significant\" travel rebound as the world emerges from coronavirus lockdowns.\nHowever the company said it was still \"too early\" to predict how the business would fare this year.\nThe company's revenue dropped 30% last year to $3.4bn (\u00a32.4bn), as Covid-19 restrictions kept many from travelling.\nThat was better than many other travel companies, as people took to their cars for longer stays in private homes.\nThe firm said it has already seen a smaller decline in travel this year than in the last three months of 2020, when revenue was down 22% year-on-year at $859m. That was better than many analysts had expected,given the resurgence of Covid cases and fresh lockdown restrictions in many areas.\n\"Travel is coming back and we are laser-focused on preparing for the travel rebound,\" its chief executive Brian Chesky said.\nMr Chesky said he expected new travel preferences to emerge from the pandemic that will benefit his company.\nHe said the firm is optimistic that staying in private homes will appeal to people travelling to see family and friends. Remote working patterns will also allow people to take more frequent weekend trips - or even spend several months away from home, he suggested.\n\"We've\u00a0seen a number of new use cases,\" he said. \"We don't think we're ever going to go back to travel in 2019. It's going to change and it's going to be different.\"\nHowever, Airbnb also warned that it still had \"limited visibility for growth trends in 2021 given the difficulty in determining the pace of vaccine rollouts and the related impact on willingness to travel\".\n\"We are not providing an outlook for the rest of 2021 at this time,\" it said in its first financial update for investors since its public listing in December.\nAirbnb, which is active in more than 220 countries, said people around the world are travelling more domestically during the pandemic - but not enough to make up for the loss of business from international tourism.\nIts business in Europe, which is fuelled by cross-border travel, was the hardest hit region in 2020, especially the UK, Germany and Italy. North America was the most stable.\nOverall the firm lost $4.6bn last year, including $3.9bn in the last three months of the year, when it was hit with high costs connected with its stock market debut.\nA recent survey conducted for the company in the US found that more than half of about 1,000 respondents had already booked or were planning to travel this year.\nOn a call with analysts, the firm faced some questions about its relationships with hosts, which has been strained this year partly due to financial losses suffered after cancellations.\nBut Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at CFRA, said he expected revenue to come \"roaring back\" as vaccines become widely distributed in the US and Europe by the summer, \"reflecting the enormous amount of pent-up demand in the ecosystem\". \n\"We believe Airbnb's business model and growth opportunities are highly attractive and struggle to find a better way to play the travel space,\" he said."

      "text": "The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have received Covid-19 vaccinations, Buckingham Palace has said.\nA royal source said the vaccinations were administered on Saturday by a household doctor at Windsor Castle.\nThe source added the Queen decided to let it be known she had the vaccination to prevent further speculation.\nThe Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are among around 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far.\nPeople aged over 80 in the UK are among the high-priority groups who are being given the vaccine first. \nThe couple have been spending the lockdown in England at their Windsor Castle home after deciding to have a quiet Christmas at their Berkshire residence, instead of the traditional royal family gathering at Sandringham. \nLast month, the Queen appeared alongside several other senior members of the royal family for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began.\nIn 2020 she went seven months - between March and October - without carrying out public engagements outside of a royal residence.\nDuring that time, her eldest child, Prince Charles, 72, contracted coronavirus and displayed mild symptoms.\nPalace sources also told the BBC that her grandson Prince William tested positive in April - although Kensington Palace refused to comment officially.\nThe Queen used her Christmas Day message to reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they \"are not alone\".\nShe said the pandemic had \"brought us closer\" despite causing hardship, adding that the Royal Family has been \"inspired\" by people volunteering in their communities.\nOn Friday a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna - was approved for use in the UK, joining the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators.\nIt is not known which vaccine the Queen and Prince Philip have received.\nAll the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection, with the second dose being given up to 12 weeks after the first.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care home residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who have been categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable."

      "text": "The Cairngorms' landscape has been recreated in the video game Minecraft to help young people understand how to run a national park. \nThe virtual world, in which players can build anything using blocks, covers all 1,700 sq miles (4,402 sq km) of the park, which includes parts of Highland, Moray, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire. \nThe settlements have been stripped out and members of the Cairngorms Youth Action Team are being asked to build new communities.\nIt is designed to get them thinking about how planning decisions are taken.\nBut it is fair to say that the team are not taking it totally seriously. \nSixteen-year-old Campbell from Aviemore says he has been constructing a hill fort at the top of Cairn Gorm, one of the UK's tallest mountains.\nHe explains: \"It doesn't get the temperature across very well but it gets the landscape.\n\"We've been up the Cairngorms and seen the corries. The Lairig Ghru's quite recognisable.\n\"It's as realistic as it can be. You know what area you're in by the different types of trees and if there are trees or not.\"\nFellow player Ellie Moore said: \"While we're trying to build things and farm there's this constant barrage of monsters and enemies that come out at night\n\"So, it's been quite hard to venture out into the world because you're constantly trying to survive but I'd say where we've been so far has been relatively accurate.\"\nRecreating the park was a lockdown project which Dan Harris carried out in his spare time.\nDuring the day he's planning manager for the Cairngorms National Park Authority.\nHe said: \"They're basically dropped onto the map at the place where Aviemore should be and they've been asked to create a community or neighbourhood that meets the aims of the national park.\n\"So, things they have to start thinking about are how they protect and enhance the natural environment and how they make sustainable use of resources.\""

      "tags": "Catholicism,Roman Catholic Church,Philadelphia",
      "text": "Plans to transfer the remains of a nun who is under consideration for a sainthood from a Sussex school to the US have been abandoned amid opposition.\nMother Cornelia Connelly was declared \"venerable\" by the Vatican in 1992, the first step towards sainthood. \nIt had said her remains could be moved to Philadelphia, her birthplace.\nBut more than 300 people objected to her remains being moved from Mayfield School, the independent Catholic girls' school which she founded.\nSue Gaisford of Mayfield School's Cornelian Association, who led a campaign against the transfer, said there was \"much relief and gratitude\" that the plans had been abandoned. \n\"Cornelia restored the chapel in the 1860s and it became the mother house and hub of the teaching order she founded, the Society of the Holy Child Jesus,\" she told the BBC. \n\"Her philosophy, the Cornelian spirit, still pervades both school and chapel.\n\"She specifically asked to be buried at Mayfield, and today's decision will ensure that her body will remain undisturbed and a focus for prayer and pilgrimage for many years to come.\"\nA statement from The Society of the Holy Child Jesus confirmed the \"decision has been made to withdraw the application\" for Mother Connelly's exhumation. A source told the BBC the decision had been made by the society's leadership in Rome. \nA spokeswoman for the school said: \"Our wish was always for Cornelia Connelly to remain undisturbed, but the decision was not ours to make and we have always made clear that we would abide by the final outcome.\"\nCornelia Connelly was born in Philadelphia in 1809. \nShe married and had five children before her husband, Pierce Connelly, converted to Catholicism and decided to become a priest.\nShe supported him, even though it meant the end of their marriage. She went on to convert to Catholicism herself, later becoming a nun and taking a \"vow of perpetual chastity\". \nBut her husband later renounced his priesthood and kidnapped their children, refusing to let Cornelia see them. \nAfter years of heartache she moved to England and devoted herself to education, founding Mayfield School in 1872. \nAt the end of her life she asked to be buried there. \nThe bid to exhume her remains was made earlier this month by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, who applied to Catholic Historic Churches earlier this month.\nThe aim was to remove a portion of her body and transfer it to a new home at Philadelphia Catholic Cathedral. \nA statement on the cathedral's website said Mother Connelly's \"sacred remains\" would \"soon will be translated from England to a new tomb in our Cathedral Basilica\".\nThe practice of gathering a saint's relics is sometimes practised within Catholicism as a means of furthering their cause, though the Cornelian Association of former pupils described the proposal as \"macabre\". \nIt said in a statement to the Catholic newspaper The Tablet: \"The gathering of relics, even of saints (which, officially, Cornelia is not) is virtually obsolete and seldom practised in the modern Church. Most people now regard it as a distasteful mediaeval custom\"."

      "text": "The Pfizer vaccine appears to slow the spread of coronavirus as well as preventing people getting seriously ill, a study at a hospital has found.\nThe findings support similar research by Public Health England and an Oxford-AstraZeneca study, examining whether vaccines can stop the virus spreading. \nThe researchers said the results were a \"genuine good news story\" but warned that other precautionary measures were still required to combat the virus.\nThe impact on transmission is critical.\nIf a vaccine only stops you getting severely ill - but you can still catch and pass on the virus - everyone will need to be immunised to be protected.\nBut if it also stops you spreading the virus, there would be a far greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who is vaccinated indirectly protects other people, too.\nAddenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, has been testing staff regularly for coronavirus, even if they do not have any symptoms. \nIt started rolling out the Pfizer vaccine in early December and just over a month later had a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated staff. \nThe regular swabbing showed 17 in 1,000 unvaccinated staff were testing positive in mid-January while only four in 1,000 staff who had had their first dose were positive. \nThere was a similar reduction among people who had no symptoms, but were still testing positive - and therefore potentially able to spread the virus unknowingly. \nThe headline results have been posted online, but the full data has not been reviewed by other scientists. \n\"This is a genuine good news story. People should be really pleased that the vaccine will protect them and they should have the vaccine in order to prevent themselves and others from getting infected,\" one of the researchers, Dr Mike Weeks, told the BBC.\nHowever, even with the vaccine there was not complete protection, he warned. \n\"The vaccine doesn't completely prevent infection and so handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, regular testing are as important as they ever are.\"\nThe Siren study, run by Public Health England, suggested one dose of Pfizer reduced the risk of infection by 70% and two doses by 85%.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is thought to reduce infections by around two-thirds.\nProf Lawrence Young, from Warwick Medical School. said: You can't spread the virus if you're not infected, and these studies show that the vaccine blocks infection in individuals who don't have symptoms but could pass on the infection.\"\nProf Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said: \"To see such a reduction in infection rates after a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is very impressive and shows that vaccination truly does offer a way out of the current restrictions and a much brighter future.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The Duke of Sussex has said he had to step back from royal duties to protect himself and his family from the \"toxic\" situation created by the UK press.\nPrince Harry told TV chat show host James Corden it was \"destroying my mental health\" and he \"did what any husband [or] father would do\".\nBuckingham Palace confirmed last week that the prince and his wife Meghan would not resume royal duties.\nThe duke insisted they were \"stepping back rather than stepping down\".\nThe couple, who are expecting their second child, moved to California with their one-year-old son Archie after announcing their plan to step back as senior working royals last January.\nThey said at the time that they wanted to work to become financially independent.\nLast week, Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess would not return to royal duties, following a planned review of the arrangements. \nAs a result, they will have to return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages.\nIn a segment for Corden's US TV programme The Late Late Show, the duke joined the British presenter on a double-decker bus tour of Los Angeles.\nAsked by Corden about the couple's decision to walk away from royal duties, Prince Harry insisted it \"was never walking away, it was stepping back rather than stepping down\".\n\"It was a really difficult environment as a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like. And it was destroying my mental health. I was like, this is toxic.\"\nHe said he \"did what any husband [or] father would do\", and moved his family away, but insisted: \"I will never walk away, I will always be contributing. My life is public service.\"\nAsked by Corden how he sees his future after lockdown restrictions are lifted, the duke said: \"My life is always going to be about public service and Meghan signed up to that.\"\nThe interview was recorded before it was confirmed Harry and Meghan would not resume royal duties.\nBy Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent\nMuch has been said and written about Harry and Meghan over the past year, but this is Harry in his own words - the first interview since the family moved to California. \nThere's enough fluff to delight their fans - like details about Archie's first word and his love of waffles. Meghan makes an appearance via FaceTime and Harry gets muddy on an assault course. \nThe tone is informal - two mates chatting on a bus (James Corden was at their wedding) but he does ask the question people want answered, about why they are no longer working royals. \nHarry is perhaps a little defensive in his response, saying it \"was never walking away\", and although this was recorded before the official \"decree absolute\" from Buckingham Palace last week, the sentiment about continued public service is the same. \nCommentators will point to the name check for Netflix (the couple have signed a multi-million dollar deal with the streaming service). \nThen there's the fact that in-between revealing personal family details he argues the reason they left the UK was because of press intrusion. \nNext weekend, it will be Meghan who takes centre stage with Oprah.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have both taken legal action against media outlets in the past.\nThe duchess recently won a High Court privacy battle against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.\nWhen his wife first began her legal action against the Mail on Sunday, the duke described the \"painful\" impact of the \"ruthless\" press campaign against her.\n\"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,\" he said in a statement at the time.\nReferring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, Harry said his \"deepest fear is history repeating itself\".\nEarlier this month, Harry also successfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he \"turned his back\" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.\nIn a wide-ranging interview, the duke also defended Netflix drama The Crown, amid criticism from some quarters about its portrayal of the Royal Family's history.\n\"Of course it's not strictly accurate, but, loosely, it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that,\" he said.\n\"I am way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my wife or myself.\"\nLast September, it emerged the duke and duchess had agreed a deal with Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in.\nHarry also revealed that Archie's first word was \"crocodile\" and the Queen sent him a waffle maker for Christmas.\nHe added that the monarch, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, who is currently being treated in hospital for an infection, have used Zoom to video call the family, and have seen Archie \"running around\"."

      "text": "First Minister Arlene Foster has said she has \"full confidence\" in NI Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride.\nIt comes after her party, the DUP, said health officials had been \"overcautious\" in recommending a phased return of NI schools.\nThe DUP had called for the executive to revisit the plan but Dr McBride said the medical evidence had not changed.\nHealth and education officials are to work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nOn Thursday, DUP Education Minister Peter Weir said his preferred option had been a full return to school on 8 March, and that he \"wanted answers\" from Dr McBride about why his advice remained against that.\nAll schools in England are to reopen on 8 March, but only a small number of pre-school, nursery and primary pupils will return in NI on that date.\nMr Weir said he did not want NI to be \"out of sync\" with the rest of the UK or \"second-class citizens\".\nHe said NI was in a similar position to England and it was therefore \"hard to square the circle of Michael McBride and Chris Whitty being on the same page,\" considering the medical advice on reopening schools was different in the two jurisdictions.\nEast Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson also criticised health officials on Thursday, comparing Health Minister Robin Swann to \"a poodle for an unaccountable chief medical officer\". \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was \"disrespectful\" and \"disgraceful\".\nMrs Foster said \"sometimes tweets would be better to be typed out and then deleted\", adding it was not language she would have used.\nAsked whether Dr McBride still had her support, Mrs Foster said he \"absolutely\" did.\n\"He has worked tirelessly, as indeed has the chief scientific adviser and deputy to bring us impartial advice and that's the key - impartial advice - then we as politicians have to decide on the best way forward.\n\"So absolutely Michael retains and will have my full confidence and that of my party.\" \nThere have been no changes to the staggered approach, initially agreed by the executive last week.\nBut Mrs Foster said health and education officials will work together on further timelines for the return of all pupils to classrooms.\nShe said ministers indicated a desire at Thursday's meeting to avoid primary one to primary three pupils, who are due to return on 8 March, having to \"revert back\" to remote learning for a week from 22 March.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said all ministers also recognised that it was important to get students back to classrooms quickly - but safely. \nUnder the current timetable, only pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school.\nIt looks pretty clear that at least part of the executive's plan is going to change, for the return of some primary school pupils at least.\nNo principal I spoke to thought it was a good idea to bring primary one to primary three pupils back for effectively nine days, given most schools are off on St Patrick's Day and to then send them home for a week of remote learning when years 12 to 14 are due to return.\nIt is probably one of the easier changes for the executive to make.\nHowever there is still significant uncertainty for other year groups who don't yet have a potential date as to when they might return.\nWhether there are major changes this side of Easter is hard to predict because obviously it will depend how ministers see the public health situation moving.\nMuch of the executive's discussions on Thursday focused on the proposed pathway-to-recovery blueprint.\nIt is understood ministers received a presentation from interim Head of the Civil Service, Jenny Pyper, who leads the executive's Covid-19 taskforce. \nLast week, the first and deputy first ministers said they would publish the plan on Monday 1 March.\nBut at Thurday's press conference, they said they wanted to ensure they \"got it right\", rather than prematurely publishing the document.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates, but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions on different sectors can be eased.\nMrs Foster said the executive would also take into consideration \"not only local data but emerging evidence from other jurisdictions too\".\n\"We will keep to the standard of reviewing the regulations every three weeks, and every time we look at things we'll hope we can move further,\" she added. \nIn England and Scotland, recovery plans have been published that include target dates for easing restrictions - but the respective governments have said lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April.\nMs O'Neill said she hoped work on the executive's plan would continue over the weekend.\nShe added that she wanted to see \"robust and co-ordinated quarantine measures\" in place for travel across the island of Ireland, as part of the executive's overall response to manage the route out of lockdown.\nNI's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nOn Thursday, five more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.\nThe department's coronavirus death toll now stands at 2,048.\nA further 281 new positive cases of the virus have also been recorded.\nThere are also 341 people being treated for Covid-19 in hospitals, with 44 of those patients being treated in intensive case units (ICU), of those patients in ICU, 32 are ventilated.\nThe department's latest figures also show 491,593 people in Northern Ireland have now received their first Covid-19 vaccine.\nSome 31,637 people have had both doses.\nThe rate of transmission for new cases in Northern Ireland is estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.05, according to the Department of Health.\nThere were 35 additional deaths reported in the Irish Republic, with 613 more cases confirmed.\nIt means there has been a total of 4,271 coronavirus-related deaths in the country, with 217,478 confirmed cases.\nAre you worried about the new variants of coronavirus in Northern Ireland?

Therefore, we won't be able to continue absorbing those costs on the longer term.\" \nWrexham Lager sales manager Joss Roberts, said Brexit complications were having a \"major impact\", despite the majority of business comes from the UK. \n\"Prices are becoming unrealistic,\" said Mr Roberts. \n\"We've had to cancel three Irish orders this morning because the end receiver is expected to pay \u20ac11.50 per crate, that's on top of an admin courier fee.\n\"It's gone up around \u00a317 alone to the Republic of Ireland where as to the likes of Spain it's gone up over \u20ac60 a crate.\"\nHe has written to customers to warn them of the extra fees. \nThe business will \"have to work out a way.\"\nHe said: \"Do they ring us and pay the extra over the phone? Do we put an extra addition on our cost on the website? It's hassle that from December wasn't there.\"\n\"We just hope it can get better soon.\""

      "text": "A businesswoman who sued Barclays for hundreds of millions of pounds has lost her High Court fight, despite the judge saying the bank acted with \"deceit\".\nAmanda Staveley claimed her finance firm, PCP Capital, was owed money for work during the financial crisis.\nBarclays raised billions of pounds during the crisis from Middle East backers, helping it avoid a UK government bailout.\nThe court also heard about complaints about the behaviour of bank bosses.\nBarclays welcomed the decision, but Ms Staveley, 47, said immediately after the ruling that she was considering an appeal.\nShe said: \"In spite of Barclays' efforts to question my character and credentials, the court has recognised my abilities as a businesswoman and the truth of my account of events.\n\"The judgment confirms what I have said from the outset and repeated in my evidence; a senior executive at Barclays repeatedly lied to me when seeking private investment in the bank during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"The evidence at trial was clear and unequivocal; PCP was an investor in the transaction and played an integral role in the capital raising, which ultimately prevented the bank from being nationalised.\"\nShe added that she would be \"taking advice on appealing the judge's decision not to award damages.\"\nThe financier had claimed Barclays concealed the terms of its complex fundraising, rather than disclose them to the financial markets as was required. \nHowever, Mr Justice Waksman, who heard evidence at a trial in London during the summer of 2020, criticised Barclays, saying he \"found Barclays to be guilty of serious deceit towards it [PCP]\".\nHe praised Ms Staveley's character, describing her as \"the driving force of PCP\" and as a \"tough, clever and creative entrepreneur\" but said her claim \"as a whole must fail\".\nThe judge said: \"Barclays contends that, in general, Ms Staveley was thoroughly unreliable, her evidence was inconsistent with documents, she had a flawed recollection and she was guilty of 'obvious embellishment and invention'.\n\"I do not accept that as a general characterisation so that she was essentially an untruthful or unreliable witness.\"\nHe added: \"I thought that, for the most part, her evidence was reliable.\" \nPCP's lawyers had told the judge that an initial damages claim was for a sum between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a3400m. But that was scaled back over the course of the trial to amounts between around \u00a3830m and around \u00a3600m.\nMs Staveley has made headlines after becoming involved with two Premier League football clubs.\nIn 2008, she acted for then Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra when he sold the club, and last year was involved in trying to broker a deal which could have seen a Saudi consortium take control of Newcastle United.\nShe told Mr Justice Waksman how she mainly invested in sports brands and companies in the hospitality sector.\nMs Staveley, who was born near Ripon, North Yorkshire, outlined her career during the trial of her dispute with Barclays.\nAfter setting up a number of businesses in the Cambridge area, with varying degrees of success, she later moved to Abu Dhabi and was offered a job at an investment fund.\nShe told the trial in the summer she had provided a variety of services to high-profile investments and political figures across the Middle East, including the president of Libya, Colonel Gaddafi.\nThe trial contained some colourful details. It emerged that Ms Staveley was described as a \"dolly bird\" and a \"tart\" by two then Barclays' bosses during the 2008 financial crisis.\nRichard Boath referred to Ms Staveley as \"that dolly bird\" during an evening telephone call with Roger Jenkins in October 2008. Mr Jenkins referred to her as \"the tart\", the trial heard.\nAnother then-Barclays' boss speculated about whether she was \"sleeping with\" Manchester City football club owner Sheikh Mansour, the judge was told.\nStephen Jones made the comment in a telephone call with another then-bank boss in October 2008, saying: \"Whether she's sleeping with him or not I couldn't tell you...\"\nHe had also, in a separate 2008 phone call with the same colleague, referred to Ms Staveley as being as \"thick\" and having \"large breasts\", the trial heard.\nAs the comments were about to come to light in the trial last summer, Mr Jones resigned from his role as chief executive of UK Finance. \nHe apologised to both Ms Staveley and his colleagues for the remarks."

      "text": "New anti-terrorism legislation in memory of a Manchester Arena bombing victim should \"protect people and be proportionate\", the justice secretary has said as a consultation is launched. \nBuilding on \"Martyn's Law\", the new Protect Duty will require public places and venues to improve security.\nIt follows a campaign by Figen Murray, mother of Martyn Hett who died in the 2017 attack. \nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said it would \"minimise the risk of harm\".\nHe said there needed to be a balance between the \"obvious need\" for larger venues to plan and think ahead.\nMr Buckland said, while it had \"taken a long time\" to get to this stage, \"we wanted to get this right.\"\nWhitehall backed the plans last year but work stalled due to the pandemic.\nMr Hett was one of 22 people killed in a suicide bombing in the foyer of the Manchester Arena which left hundreds more injured.\nMs Murray has been campaigning to bring in legislation to step up security in crowded public spaces and venues.\nShe welcomed the move, which she described as \"a major stride towards making our country safer\". \nIn November, Ms Murray told the public inquiry into the bombing that \"the stakes were too high\" for further delay.\n\"To make Martyn's Law a reality is of huge relief and I look forward to making a lasting difference with all of those who have supported it,\" she said\n\"My focus will always be to stop such violent acts from happening again because Martyn and the other 21 victims cannot have lost their lives for nothing.\"\nProtect Duty legislation would make a legal requirement for venue operators to consider the risk of a terrorist attack and take steps to protect the public.\nCurrently, private and public owners of venues and sites are not obliged to act on advice about threats of a terrorist attack and how to mitigate the risk.\nThe consultation would help \"work out who should be subject to the duty and the extent of it and \"make sure we get the balance right between the need to protect people and the need to make sure it is proportionate,\" Mr Buckland said.  \n\"People are now going to have their chance to have their say,\" Mr Buckland said.\n\"We want to make sure this is not a dry law, that this has a real impact on the ground and so it is pitched in the right way, so we are covering the appropriate venues,\" he added. \nHome secretary Priti Patel said: \"I have heard first-hand from those who have sadly lost loved ones in horrific terror attacks, and thank them for their tireless work. \n\"We will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security.\n\"That is why we want all organisations responsible for public venues and spaces to put public safety and security first.\"\nAmong the Protect Duty proposals are:\nThe 18-week consultation will work with organisations including counter-terror police, and seek views on how the legislation would work and who precisely it would apply to.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccinating people in order of age is the fastest way to cut Covid-19 deaths in the next phase of the rollout, say experts advising the UK government.\nPeople in their 40s will be next, once the current phase is completed.\nPriority based on jobs would be \"more complex\" and could slow down the programme, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said.\nUnions representing teachers and police have criticised the decision, saying it could disrupt children's education.\nTeachers and police officers are among those who have campaigned to be prioritised in the next phase - but they will now be vaccinated in line with their age group.\nAll four nations of the UK will follow the committee's advice with a target of vaccinating all adults by end of July.\nMore than 19 million people in the UK have received a first dose so far.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which has looked at evidence on best how to reduce serious illness and death from Covid-19 in phase two of the UK's vaccination programme, says prioritising certain jobs could leave some vulnerable people waiting longer for a first dose.\nThe JCVI says the following groups should be prioritised, once all at-risk groups in phase one have been offered at least one dose of the vaccine (by mid-April): \nAnd it strongly advises some particular groups to take up a vaccine as soon as it is offered. They are:\nIn phase one, nine priority groups were set out based on age and underlying health conditions - the biggest factors in raising someone's risk. Health and care workers were also included to protect the vulnerable people they look after.\nVaccinating these groups should protect around 99% of those most at risk of dying from Covid-19.\nAll of those in the top four priority groups - around 15 million - were offered a jab by mid-February. More than 95% of the over-70s have now been vaccinated.\nProf Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 chair of the JCVI, said occupation was not well-recorded in GPs' records and the effort required to identify people by their jobs \"may slow down the whole programme\".\n\"Speed of deployment is the most important factor,\" he said, adding that a straightforward approach was better.\nMary Ramsay, from Public Health England (PHE), said even within occupation groups, age was the major factor for risk from Covid-19.\n\"We would want a 40-year-old policeman to come forward before a 20-year old,\" she said.\nAmong the under 50s, data from hospitals shows men and women in their 40s are most likely to end up in intensive care with Covid-19.\nBut Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said he was disappointed that education staff would not be prioritised in the next phase.\n\"This is important not only in reassuring staff who it expects to work in busy and crowded environments, but also in terms of minimising disruption to education caused by staff absence as a result of Covid.\"\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the teachers' union NASUWT, agreed saying the government was \"failing to take all steps possible\" to ensure schools remain open \"without the risk of further closures or of further damaging disruption to children's education\". \nMetropolitan Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh criticised the plans to prioritise by age group, saying \"it's absolutely disgusting - they don't give a damn about us\".\nThe charity Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation said thousands of people with asthma would \"rightly feel anxious, angry and ignored by government\". It has called on the government to reconsider its \"unacceptable\" decision not to prioritise everyone with the condition.\nThree million people in the UK are being vaccinated every week in the UK with either a Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nEarly research suggests the vaccines are having a significant impact on preventing serious illness from Covid-19 in the UK. There is also some indication they could be reducing transmission of the virus between people.\nAfter a sharp rise in cases and deaths in January, levels of coronavirus are now decreasing across the UK although the pressure on hospitals is still high. The R number is currently between 0.6 and 0.9.\nThere were another 345 UK deaths reported on Friday within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.\nBut there is concern that take-up of the vaccine is lower among some ethnic minority groups and people who live in poorer neighbourhoods.\nPHE's Mary Ramsay said different communities had different concerns, and health officials were working hard to get people \"on board\" so they could protect themselves as well as their communities.\nThe JCVI said the priority groups for the vaccine were based on who was most likely to be severely ill or die from Covid-19 - not on who was most likely to become infected.\nBut when both exposure to the virus and personal vulnerability were taken into account, older people were still more at risk than younger people.\n\"By targeting older people fast, we will protect the largest number in the shortest time,\" Prof Wei Shen Lim said."

There were clear policies and training in place at the time of the incident, which those involved that evening completely disregarded.\"\nThe court heard that the father-of-one's life effectively ended while being held face down on a pavement outside the Australasia restaurant in central Manchester.\nHe had recently moved from Hull and had been out with some friends on 11 October, 2016, travelling around Manchester on the city's trams.\nThe group were spotted at St Peter's Square at about 20:15 GMT and challenged by a Metrolink customer service representative (CSR).\nThe worker suspected the group was smoking illegal drugs, a claim they denied, and it is thought Mr Barnes responded with abusive language.\nEvidence in court indicated that he had taken the cannabinoid Spice at some point that day.\nThe inquest was told later that evening, shortly before 23:30, the group were spotted at Manchester Victoria station, and recognised by the CSR who had earlier challenged them.\nA group of CSRs approached them after being told about the earlier abuse.\nA row broke out and Mr Barnes became aggressive to being confronted.\nHe swung a drawstring bag he was carrying at the men, which hit two of the staff, before he and a friend ran off.\nMetrolink's policy was that their representatives should walk away from such encounters, alerting the police if necessary, and the inquest was told that all staff had been reminded of this at the start of their shift that night.\nThe policy states that CSRs cannot \"grab hold of a person\" or \"pursue a passenger either off the platform or trackside\", but the four workers - Paul Fogarty, Brian Gartside, Matthews Sellers and Stephen Rowlands - decided to chase the fleeing pair, two on foot, two in a taxi.\nAfter a nine-minute chase across almost a mile of the city centre, Mr Barnes was caught by Mr Gartside and bundled to the ground outside the Deansgate restaurant.\nBodycam footage from a camera worn by Mr Sellers, and played in court, showed that within moments of being caught, while being held down with his left cheek on the pavement, Mr Barnes asked for help, shouting out: \"I can't breathe.\"\nAfter being ignored, he repeated: \"I can't breathe.\"\nOver the course of about 90 seconds, Mr Barnes said he was struggling to breathe on eight separate occasions.\nJust before the camera moved away to focus on Mr Barnes' friend, Mr Rowlands was recorded telling him: \"If you struggle, I will put you to sleep.\n\"It won't kill you but you will go to sleep for a while.\"\nThe inquest heard Mr Barnes had a cardiac arrest and, despite a police officer and a passing ambulance crew providing assistance, he never recovered and died on 2 December, having been transferred from Manchester Royal Infirmary to a hospital in Hull.\nGiving evidence to the inquest, the men refused to answer many questions about the incident, having been given legal advice that to do so could incriminate them.\nHowever, Mr Rowlands told the coroner that he had been trained in restraint while serving as a GMP officer for 13 years and that he had left the force due to an injury in 1989.\nHe estimated that he had restrained \"well over 1,000 people\" during his police career.\nHe also told the inquest that \"it didn't enter my head\" to follow Metrolink's \"walk away\" policy.\nMr Rowlands declined to speak to the BBC when approached for comment.\nRecording a conclusion of unlawful killing, Mr Meadows said that the exertion of the chase and the pressure on Mr Barnes's neck more than minimally contributed to the heart attack.\nHe found the restraint amounted to assault as it was unnecessarily prolonged and the CSRs had had an opportunity to both call the police and to sit Mr Barnes up into a more comfortable position.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mr Barnes's mother Tricia Gerrard told the BBC the men had \"hunted him down like an animal\".\nShe said the family refused to believe he had attacked the CSRs, as at \"any sign of trouble, any sign of violence, he'd run\".\nThe inquest was told the bag that hit the men contained clothes and a phone charger.\nMrs Gerrard said she wants the four CSRs, who had \"never apologised [and] never showed any remorse\", to be prosecuted.\nGreater Manchester Police, whose officers investigated the case, told the BBC in a statement that \"following a review by the Crown Prosecution Service, four men\u2026 who were arrested on suspicion of assault were released without charge\".\nLauren Dale of Hudgell Solicitors, who represented the family, said: \"This case is a reminder of the tragic consequences of security and other personnel seeking confrontation and using excessive force.  \n\"In this case, the policy of the employer was to walk away, yet they chased Jack for more than half a mile before pinning him to the ground and bluntly refused to listen to his requests to allow him to breathe more easily.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

That is why the charity collapsed.\"\nThe Official Receiver (OR) brought High Court proceedings against Ms Batmanghelidjh and the former trustees, arguing they were \"unfit\" to hold directorships because of their handling of the charity.\nBut, in a ruling on February 12, Mrs Justice Falk rejected the case and said the charity may have survived financially to continue its work had it not closed.\nA statement issued after the ruling on behalf of the former trustees said: \"Kids Company was forced to close in August 2015 following what the judge records as 'unfounded allegations' of child abuse, which made fundraising from private and government sources impossible.\n\"We are pleased that finally the facts have been gathered and assessed in a court of law, and that Mrs Justice Falk has exonerated both the former trustees and Kids Company chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh.\"\nFounded in 1996 in south London, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to up to 36,000 deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people.\nIt employed more than 600 people, with high-profile supporters including the then prime minister David Cameron.\nYou can listen to the full Woman's Hour interview here."

      "text": "Some areas of the UK are \"burning quite hot\" with rising levels of new coronavirus infections, England's deputy chief medical officer says. \nAlthough coronavirus levels are still decreasing across much of the UK, there are hotspots that buck the trend. \nThese are in the Midlands and east and west coast of England and some parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam told Friday's Downing Street briefing the battle is not yet won.\nHe warned people not to wreck it by relaxing the rules too early. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the aim was still to come out of lockdown together as a nation, but did not rule out measures being imposed locally if needed. The differences between areas now are smaller than those seen in the autumn.\nProf Van-Tam said: \"In some parts of the UK, case rates are changing, albeit slowly, in the wrong direction.\n\"This is not a good sign and reinforces the fact that I'm afraid this battle at the moment is not won.\"\nThe latest R number - 0.6 to 0.9 - suggests infection numbers are shrinking overall in the UK. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 6 and 9 other people.\nHospital pressures and deaths are still high, however, despite the UK's coronavirus alert level having been lowered from the maximum five to four. \nAnother 345 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 122,415, or 135,613 if you include death certificates that mention Covid-19. \nThere were 15,485 patients in hospital with coronavirus on 24 February 2021. \nPeople are still being advised to take precautions to stop the spread. There is still lots of the virus circulating.\nLatest ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nMeanwhile, the chair of Britain's Covid vaccine advice committee says the next phase of the vaccine rollout should focus on age groups rather than occupations.\nIt means people aged 40-49 will be the next in line to get a vaccine from mid-April, after all vulnerable groups and the over-50s are covered.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the priority was to deploy vaccines as quickly as possible to protect lives, and that targeting occupational groups would be more complex and may slow the rollout. \nLatest figures show 19,177,555 people in the UK have received a first dose of Covid vaccine and 736,037 have been given a second dose."

      "text": "Vaccinating people in order of age is the fastest way to cut Covid-19 deaths in the next phase of the rollout, say experts advising the UK government.\nPeople in their 40s will be next, once the current phase is completed.\nPriority based on jobs would be \"more complex\" and could slow down the programme, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said.\nUnions representing teachers and police have criticised the decision, saying it could disrupt children's education.\nTeachers and police officers are among those who have campaigned to be prioritised in the next phase - but they will now be vaccinated in line with their age group.\nAll four nations of the UK will follow the committee's advice with a target of vaccinating all adults by end of July.\nMore than 19 million people in the UK have received a first dose so far.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which has looked at evidence on best how to reduce serious illness and death from Covid-19 in phase two of the UK's vaccination programme, says prioritising certain jobs could leave some vulnerable people waiting longer for a first dose.\nThe JCVI says the following groups should be prioritised, once all at-risk groups in phase one have been offered at least one dose of the vaccine (by mid-April): \nAnd it strongly advises some particular groups to take up a vaccine as soon as it is offered. They are:\nIn phase one, nine priority groups were set out based on age and underlying health conditions - the biggest factors in raising someone's risk. Health and care workers were also included to protect the vulnerable people they look after.\nVaccinating these groups should protect around 99% of those most at risk of dying from Covid-19.\nAll of those in the top four priority groups - around 15 million - were offered a jab by mid-February. More than 95% of the over-70s have now been vaccinated.\nProf Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 chair of the JCVI, said occupation was not well-recorded in GPs' records and the effort required to identify people by their jobs \"may slow down the whole programme\".\n\"Speed of deployment is the most important factor,\" he said, adding that a straightforward approach was better.\nMary Ramsay, from Public Health England (PHE), said even within occupation groups, age was the major factor for risk from Covid-19.\n\"We would want a 40-year-old policeman to come forward before a 20-year old,\" she said.\nAmong the under 50s, data from hospitals shows men and women in their 40s are most likely to end up in intensive care with Covid-19.\nBut Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said he was disappointed that education staff would not be prioritised in the next phase.\n\"This is important not only in reassuring staff who it expects to work in busy and crowded environments, but also in terms of minimising disruption to education caused by staff absence as a result of Covid.\"\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the teachers' union NASUWT, agreed saying the government was \"failing to take all steps possible\" to ensure schools remain open \"without the risk of further closures or of further damaging disruption to children's education\". \nMetropolitan Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh criticised the plans to prioritise by age group, saying \"it's absolutely disgusting - they don't give a damn about us\".\nThe charity Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation said thousands of people with asthma would \"rightly feel anxious, angry and ignored by government\". It has called on the government to reconsider its \"unacceptable\" decision not to prioritise everyone with the condition.\nThree million people in the UK are being vaccinated every week in the UK with either a Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nEarly research suggests the vaccines are having a significant impact on preventing serious illness from Covid-19 in the UK. There is also some indication they could be reducing transmission of the virus between people.\nAfter a sharp rise in cases and deaths in January, levels of coronavirus are now decreasing across the UK although the pressure on hospitals is still high. The R number is currently between 0.6 and 0.9.\nThere were another 345 UK deaths reported on Friday within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.\nBut there is concern that take-up of the vaccine is lower among some ethnic minority groups and people who live in poorer neighbourhoods.\nPHE's Mary Ramsay said different communities had different concerns, and health officials were working hard to get people \"on board\" so they could protect themselves as well as their communities.\nThe JCVI said the priority groups for the vaccine were based on who was most likely to be severely ill or die from Covid-19 - not on who was most likely to become infected.\nBut when both exposure to the virus and personal vulnerability were taken into account, older people were still more at risk than younger people.\n\"By targeting older people fast, we will protect the largest number in the shortest time,\" Prof Wei Shen Lim said."

Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "The Supreme Court is to rule later whether the runaway schoolgirl Shamima Begum should be allowed back into the UK from Syria.\nThe ruling comes six years after the then 15-year-old left with friends to join the Islamic State group. \nThe government stripped her of British nationality so she cannot return. \nFive justices must decide whether the only fair way she can challenge that decision is to allow her back to take part in the case. \nMs Begum's lawyers also argue she should automatically win her case to remain British, if she cannot receive a fair hearing. \nThe 21-year-old is in a camp controlled by armed guards in northern Syria. \nShe cannot speak to her lawyers or participate in a hearing by video. \nTwo years ago, the then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Ms Begum of her citizenship, following the collapse of the IS regime. \nThe Court of Appeal ruled last July Ms Begum had been denied a fair opportunity to challenge that decision because she could not make her case from the camp. \nThe government then asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the Court of Appeal's ruling - so Friday's outcome has potentially major implications for Ms Begum's case and others like it.\nSeparately, the Attorney General's Office has confirmed the Sun newspaper will not be taken to court for revealing the Court of Appeal's judgement, apparently leaked to it by someone in government. \nThe story, headlined \"Return of Traitor\", briefly appeared online on the eve of the decision last July, quoting government sources. \nIt was taken down within an hour, after lawyers intervened. \nPublishing a judgement before it is public is generally considered a serious contempt of court and, in the case of newspapers, can lead to a significant fine. \nAn internal Whitehall inquiry into who might have briefed the newspaper has been sent to judges.  \nA spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said the Sun's actions had been carefully considered by the solicitor-general, the second ranking minister in the department. \n\"After very careful consideration the solicitor-general concluded that contempt proceedings will not be instigated on this occasion,\" he said. \n\"However, it is to be understood that interference with the administration of justice constitutes a serious offence.\n\"And the Attorney General's Office will review all contempt-of-court allegations made to us.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nPeople aged between 40 and 49 will be next in line for a vaccination in the UK, experts advising the government have decided. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says vaccinating people in order of age is the fastest way to reduce deaths from Covid-19 when the next phase of the programme begins. Explaining why key workers such as police officers or teachers would not be given priority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing \"this is the fastest and simplest way to roll out the jab. Our moral duty is to put saving lives first\". Find out when you are due to get the vaccine. \nLevels of coronavirus have continued to fall across the UK, Office for National Statistics data shows. The figures, for the seven days up to 19 February, reveal about 421,300 people in the community with the virus. \"We are moving in the right direction,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Downing Street press briefing. \"But there is still significant pressure on the NHS... This is still a deadly virus.\"\nThe Pfizer vaccine appears to slow the spread of coronavirus as well as preventing people getting seriously ill, a study at a hospital has found. The findings - based on testing of staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge - support similar research by Public Health England and an Oxford-AstraZeneca study, examining whether vaccines can stop the virus spreading. But the researchers warned other precautionary measures were still required to combat the virus.\nBoris Johnson has announced a review of vaccine certificates or passports, which could be used to allow people to travel or attend large events. But an online petition is urging the government not to introduce them - and now has more than 200,000 signatures.  It says the passports could be \"used to restrict the rights of people who have refused a Covid-19 vaccine\". Read more about vaccine certificates here.\nBritish Airways owner IAG has called for international common testing standards and digital health passes \"to reopen our skies safely\" as it posted a record loss for 2020 due to Covid disruption. IAG posted an operating loss of \u20ac7.4bn (\u00a36.5bn) for last year after the pandemic grounded many of its flights. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "ITV has brought the final of this year's series of Dancing On Ice forward by a week after a string of celebrities pulled out through illness and injury.\nThe final will now take place on 14 March, instead of 21 March as planned.\nThe decision comes after producers scrapped last week's live programme because of the disruption.\nOn Monday Jason Donovan became the latest star to pull out, following Denise van Outen, Billie Shepherd, Rufus Hound and Joe-Warren Plant.\nThe Australian singer and actor has been suffering from back pain, while actress van Outen and reality TV star Shepherd both sustained injuries during training.\nMeanwhile, comedian Hound and Emmerdale actor Plant tested positive for Covid-19.\nOn top of the celebrity withdrawals, professional skater Hamish Gaman, who partnered soap actress Faye Brookes, dropped out last week after injuring a finger while putting on a sock. He was replaced by Matt Evers.\nBrookes told ITV's This Morning on Friday that training with a new partner was a \"whole new world\", adding: \"We've had 11 hours together to get ready for Sunday.\"\nEvers said: \"We are still standing, the morale here is still high.\n\"We know we're up against a lot this year and it's just a matter of making the best out of a weird situation that 2020 and 2021 have brought, so it's a matter of continuing to move forward, keeping that smile on our faces and hopefully entertaining people on Sunday night.\"\nThe contest is due to resume this weekend with five remaining celebrities - Brookes, Rebekah Vardy, Lady Leshurr, Colin Jackson and Sonny Jay.\nAn ITV spokesperson said: \"Our production team and cast have delivered a fantastic show during incredibly challenging times. Continuing to make the best TV for our viewers is our top priority and we look forward to the rest of the series.\"\nDancing On Ice is not alone in having to deal with disruption to its schedule in recent months.\nBritain's Got Talent was recently postponed until next year due to concerns around safety during the pandemic. Producers said it would be difficult for acts like dance groups, choirs and orchestras to rehearse and audition safely.\nIt followed a delay in the filming of its Christmas special after at least three crew members tested positive for coronavirus.\nITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! relocated from the Australian jungle to a derelict castle in north Wales because of the pandemic.\nOn the BBC, Strictly Come Dancing was also hit when former boxer Nicola Adams and her professional partner Katya Jones left the contest after Jones tested positive.\nBruno Tonioli did not sit alongside his fellow judges as he could not fly back and forth between the UK and the US, where he was appearing on Dancing with the Stars. Motsi Mabuse, meanwhile, had to self-isolate for two weeks after an \"urgent\" trip abroad.\nIn January, filming on ITV soap Emmerdale was suspended for a week after a number of positive tests among those working on the show. \nAnd fellow soap Coronation Street paused production for two weeks to allow its writers to change its then-future storylines and scripts to ensure it was feasible to film them within current restrictions.\nBoth shows have however been able to continue screening six episodes a week.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Duke of Sussex has given further insights into life in California with Meghan and their son Archie, giving an interview to James Corden while travelling the streets of Los Angeles on an open-top bus.\nThe unconventional interview setting provided plenty of fresh air and space for social distancing - and the prince apparently relished his first ride on an open-top double-decker.\nThe appearance was more informal than the duke and duchess's forthcoming sit-down with Oprah Winfrey is likely to be, while Corden's style is more jokey and less probing.\nBut that didn't stop Harry opening up about some elements of the family's life and their decision to swap London for LA, explaining how the UK press was \"toxic\" and \"destroying my mental health\".\nHe also gave Corden his views about Netflix's The Crown and revealed what the Queen gave Archie for Christmas. Here are seven nuggets we learned from the interview:\nHarry, Meghan and Archie left the UK almost a year ago after \"stepping back\" from life as working royals. They have now settled in Santa Barbara, California.\nAsked by Corden what their lives would involve after lockdown is lifted, Harry replied: \"I've no idea. A slightly different version but a continuation of what we were doing back in the UK.\n\"My life is always going to be about public service - the two of us signed up to that and the two of us enjoy doing that, trying to bring some compassion and trying to make people happy and trying to change the world in any small way that we can.\"\nHarry revealed that the Queen had asked what Archie, now aged one and a half, wanted for his last Christmas present, and was told by Meghan he wanted a waffle maker.\n\"She sent us a waffle maker for Archie,\" he said. \"So for breakfast now, Meg makes up a beautiful organic mix in the waffle maker... He loves it. And now I have waffles for breakfast, a bit of yoghurt, a bit of jam on top. I don't know if that's the right thing to do. Berries maybe. A bit of honey. Maybe some syrup.\"\nNot \"dada\" or \"mama\" or \"nanny\" - but \"crocodile\", apparently.\nHarry said his son is now \"hysterical\", adding: \"He's got the most amazing personality.\"\nYes, that is what they call each other.\nCorden and the prince stopped off on their open-top bus tour at the house that was used in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. After Harry proved he was a true fan of the 90s sitcom by rapping the theme tune while walking up the drive, Corden tried to persuade him to buy the property.\nThe host then FaceTimed Meghan on Harry's phone in an attempt to convince her - she demurred, saying \"I think we've done enough moving\", before asking her husband: \"Haz, how's your tour of LA going?\"\nAsked what a regular evening was like for the Sussexes in Santa Barbara, Harry said: \"Depending on how the day's been and how busy it's been, we do Archie's tea, give him a bath, read him a book, put him down, go downstairs, Meg might cook a meal, might order a takeaway, go upstairs sit in bed, turn the TV on, watch some Jeopardy, maybe watch a little bit of Netflix.\"\nSpeaking of Netflix... There have been some vocal objections to how The Crown depicts royal history, especially now it has reached the era of Harry's parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.\nBut Harry was sanguine about it, even suggesting its dramatisations could give outsiders a useful glimpse into the hardships of royal life.\n\"They don't pretend to be news,\" he said. \"It's fictional, but it's loosely based on the truth. Of course it's not strictly accurate, but loosely, it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that.\n\"I'm way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family or my wife or myself. Because it's the difference between - that [The Crown] is obviously fiction, take it how you will, but this [the press] is being reported as fact because you're supposedly news. I have a real issue with that.\"\nAsked when he knew Meghan might be \"the one\", Harry replied: \"The second date I was starting to think, wow, this is pretty special. It was the way we hit it off with each other and we were so comfortable in each other's company.\n\"Dating with me, or with any member of the Royal Family I guess, is kind of flipped upside down. All the dates become dinners or watching the TV or chatting at home. And then eventually once you become a couple, then you venture out to dinners, to the cinema and everything else.\n\"So everything was done back-to-front with us. Actually we got to spend an enormous amount of time just the two of us, rather than going to friends' houses or out for dinner where there are other distractions, and that was great, it was an amazing thing. We went from zero to 60 in the first two months.\"\nHe did not touch on the Duke of Edinburgh's health, or Meghan's pregnancy. They announced the latter earlier this month, after revealing Meghan had a miscarriage last summer.\nHe and Meghan may well discuss those subjects when they are interviewed together by Oprah. That is due to be broadcast on 7 March. It is not known whether it will be conducted on an open-top bus."

      "text": "A Covid outbreak at a north Wales hospital is a lesson that people cannot let their guard down, a doctor says. \nThe outbreak at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor last week hit five adult wards and at the time 49 people were being treated. \nThe \"majority\" of planned operations have been cancelled for two weeks.\nDr Phil White, who chairs the British Medical Association's Welsh GP committee, said: \"I think the lesson is, this has not gone away.\"\nHe told Oliver Hides on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"Despite the mass vaccination programme which is really progressing at pace, we can't let our guard down.\"\nHe added: \"We're hoping over the next three or four weeks, the vaccine supply, the tap will really turn on and then you'll see this really moving at pace.\"\nDr Claire Kilduff, Lead Consultant in Respiratory Medicine at Ysbyty Gwynedd, said: \"At the moment we're not seeing a reflection in critical care numbers from this current outbreak but we are in the eye of storm... it's early days.\"\nDr Kilduff added: \"This has obviously been one of the most challenging couple of weeks for the hospital site as a whole - certainly during the last 12 months...\n\"We're incredibly upset that this has happened at all, let alone after the 12 months of what's been a hard slog that everybody's been through.\"\nShe said an \"absolute priority\" was to \"stamp out these outbreaks as they occur and to support the patients affected through the next couple of weeks\".\nShe also warned people against complacency: \"Now's not the time to make mistakes and relax. \n\"The vaccination programme is going really well in those parts of Wales but now is the time to really knuckle down.\"\nNorth-east Wales had been the worrying hotspot after Christmas, but both Flintshire and particularly Wrexham have seen falls. Wrexham's case rate is below 70 per 100,000 for the first time since late-September.\nAnglesey's case rate is still in three figures - on 101.4 cases per 100,000 but considerably below the peak of 195.6 it reached in early January. \nAnglesey council released a warning earlier in the week about the high case rates, urging people to follow the rules.\nGwynedd currently has a case rate of 80.3 cases per 100,000, while Conwy's case rate is closer to the level it was at in mid-December.\nAlthough Betsi Cadwaladr has more Covid patients in critical care than any other health board in Wales - 17 - this is half the number seen at the end of January."

      "title": "UK Covid alert level drops as NHS threat 'recedes'",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's coronavirus alert level has been lowered from level five to four in all four nations as the risk that the NHS could be overwhelmed \"has receded\".\nThe four UK chief medical officers and NHS England's national medical director agreed the change following advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre.\nThe alert level had moved to level five on 4 January, shortly before England and Scotland began fresh lockdowns.\nThe top medics urged people to \"remain vigilant\" by following lockdown rules.\nA change in the alert level does not automatically mean restrictions can ease, but it helps to inform government decisions on the rules.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have this week set out their separate plans to lift lockdown restrictions. Northern Ireland and Wales will outline their plans in the coming weeks.\nEngland's Prof Chris Whitty, Northern Ireland's Dr Michael McBride, Scotland's Dr Gregor Smith, Wales's Dr Frank Atherton and NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said their decision to reduce the alert level was made because the number of cases in hospital was \"consistently declining\".\nHowever, they warned: \"We should be under no illusions - transmission rates, hospital pressures and deaths are still very high.\"\nThey said the vaccine rollout would eventually have \"a major impact\" but for the time being \"it is really important that we all - vaccinated or not - remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidelines\".\nProf Whitty added in a tweet: \"If we continue to follow the guidance, cases will continue to fall.\"\nA further 9,985 new coronavirus cases were reported in the UK in Thursday's daily figures, as well as 323 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nThe coronavirus alert level, unveiled by the UK government in May 2020, is measured by a five-level, colour-coded system.\nLevel five (red), the highest level, is when there is a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\" within 21 days, and extremely strict social distancing is enforced.\nLevel four indicates a high or rising level of transmission, with social distancing still enforced.\nThe UK's alert level dropped down to level three in June 2020. During the summer, restrictions were gradually relaxed to allow people to socialise in groups indoors, and much of society reopened, including pubs and restaurants.\nHowever, the alert level was moved back up to level four in September as case numbers began to climb again. The same month a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus was detected in Kent. \nAs cases spiralled across the UK, the country moved to the highest level, level five, on 4 January.\nThe move to alert level five was made because the chief medical officers were worried the NHS was at risk of being overwhelmed.  \nIt was an announcement that essentially forced England's third national lockdown. \nBut since the number of cases peaked at over 39,000 in mid-January, cases have fallen rapidly. \nIn fact, the numbers of new admissions coming in each day are not far off what you would normally get for respiratory illnesses in winter.  \nBut while the immediate threat is over, hospitals are still incredibly busy. There are over 16,000 patients with Covid in hospital - that's only around 25% lower than the total in the peak of the first wave.  \nOperating theatres continue to be used as temporary critical care areas and non-urgent care is being cancelled in some places. \nBut with infection levels still coming down, we know this will ease further, hence the move to level four. \nThe Joint Biosecurity Centre, set up by the government in spring last year, has the task of recommending what the alert level should be, based on:\nThe centre's scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said despite the UK's alert level dropping, there was a \"long way to go yet\" and that no-one from the health service was \"anywhere near declaring this phase of battle won\".\nMeanwhile, new NHS England figures suggest one in five adults in England under the age of 70 have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nAn estimated 20.3% of people between the ages of 16 and 69 had been given their first jab as of 21 February, the figures say.\nHowever, the figures highlight some regional variations, with at least one in four over-70s yet to receive their first dose in several parts of London.\nMore than 18 million people have had a first vaccine dose - equivalent to one in three adults in the UK.\nThe vaccine rollout has entered its next phase, after everyone in the top four priority groups was offered a jab.\nMany areas are now offering vaccine appointments to over-60s, adult carers of disabled people and younger adults in care homes."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Alex Salmond case,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story.\nAs the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal.\nIt was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day the Daily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct made against her predecessor, Alex Salmond.\nThe first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera.\nWhen it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how \"incredibly difficult\" the situation was.\nAt about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was \"no saint\" he had not harassed anyone.\nThe Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before.\nWhat then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears?\nThis was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her.\nHaving controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July.\nNicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nicola Sturgeon.\nThere was a lot to cry about. \nThe Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21.\n\"He believed in me long before I believed in myself,\" she once said.\nAlex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate.\nHe appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job.\nThe then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket.\nThis was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014.\nThey worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail.\nThey offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built.\nThat's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she \"pushed very hard\" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign.\nNicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called \"Yes\" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his.\nContrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote rather than against the BBC.\nWhere he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it.\nWhile their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension.\nNicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions.\nWhen he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic.\nNone of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office.\nOn 18 September 2014 the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45% and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister.\nAs Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left \"big boots to fill\".\nHowever, she also asserted her political independence. \"I will wear my own shoes\" she said \"and they will have higher heels\".\nShe promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later.\nThe key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer.\nThe new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her \"rock star tour\" and under her leadership the SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. \nBy contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics.\nAs part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus.\nWhen Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK.\nWithin a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017.\nThey were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart.\nThe relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which saw Alex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service.\nWhen Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke.\nAlex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else.\nA friend of his said he was \"not very impressed\" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP.\nIf that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he \"couldn't make them come\".\nNicola Sturgeon said he was \"not sexist\" just as she had done two years earlier when Alex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to \"behave yourself woman\". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill.\nIt was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was \"seen as a nuisance\" by the leadership during 2017.\nThe lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced that Alex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her \"incredulity\" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - \"the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV\".\nThe week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. \nThe Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election.\nAccording to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader.\nWhat appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct.\nOn the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry.\nThis note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that.\nSupporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor.\nHad she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend.\nComplaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-old successfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was \"tainted by apparent bias\" and he was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal costs.\nBut the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead.\nIn January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister.\nWhen he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - \"that was when it hit him\" that this could be a conspiracy.\nOne of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is \"utterly absurd\" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced.\nAlex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims.\nTheir toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. \nFor example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that \"allegations of a sexual nature\" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. \nExactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood.\nThe inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee.\nWhat started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly.\nIf his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties.\nWhile those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it \"you just never know what Alex is going to do next\"."

      "text": "Labour's support for keeping the UK's nuclear weapons is \"non-negotiable,\" the shadow defence secretary has said. \nBut in a speech, John Healey also promised to \"lead efforts to secure multilateral disarmament\" if the party wins power.\nLabour dropped its policy of unilaterally getting rid of the UK's nuclear weapons after then-leader Neil Kinnock lost the 1987 general election.\nMany on the party's left remain vehemently opposed to that decision.\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - a long-time opponent of the UK's Trident submarine-based missile system and a vice president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) - said in 2015 that he would never use it if he became prime minister.\nYet maintaining nuclear weapons remained a pledge in the party's 2019 election manifesto.\nIn a speech to the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Mr Healey emphasised that the party leadership under Sir Keir Starmer is far clearer in its backing of this than Mr Corbyn was.\n\"Labour's support for the UK's nuclear deterrent is non-negotiable. The matter is settled,\" he said. \nHe added that Labour wanted to see the UK \"doing more to lead efforts to secure strategic arms limitation and multilateral disarmament\". \nMr Healey also said the party's commitment to the NATO military alliance - which Mr Corbyn said in 2012 should be disbanded, but later argued should focus on reducing \"tensions around the world\" - is  \"unshakeable\".\nThis isn't a change in policy, but it's a distinct change in tone.\nLabour wants to make sure it gets a serious hearing on defence.\nIt knows that it needs its own position to be clear to be able to most effectively challenge the government's decisions (which is particularly important with the Integrated Review due soon).\nThat means definitively answering some of the questions which have been raised over recent years, especially around NATO and nuclear weapons.\nKeeping Britain's nuclear weapons system has always been a divisive issue within Labour, but it is party policy.\nThat didn't change under Jeremy Corbyn, but his lifelong personal opposition to nuclear weapons - and his statement in 2015 that he would never use them - allowed Labour's commitment to be questioned.\nStating that it is \"non-negotiable\" ends that speculation, although it is unlikely to go down well with everyone in the party.\nThe government launched its Integrated Review last year, looking at the UK's long-term foreign policy and defence priorities.\nMr Healey said the review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are, not where the business opportunities might be\".\nHe also called for the review - which ministers have promised this month - to be published now, to end \"confusion and speculation\" about its contents. \nHe added that unless the review confirmed a reduction in potential threats to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\". \nAnd he also urged the government to \"set a higher bar\" when deciding to buy military equipment from abroad. \nResponding to Mr Healey's speech, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament accused Labour's leadership of being \"stuck in a 20th Century rut\".\nIts general secretary Kate Hudson said the UK today was facing \"new and different threats,\" including climate change, pandemics, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare.\n\"This is where investment urgently needs to go, not on massively expensive nuclear weapons,\" she added. \n\"Labour has to stop pandering to an old agenda and give the people the sensible, forward-looking thinking that today's reality demands.\"  \nThe government has promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21.\nIt expects the overall figure to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\nMargaret Thatcher's Conservative government first acquired Trident - using submarines to carry up to eight missiles each - in the early 1980s, replacing the previous Polaris system.\nOpponents say the maintenance and update costs - running into billions of pounds - are excessive and that the deterrent effect of such weapons is questionable, and that is not truly independent as it relies on US technology.\nBut supporters argue that there is no alternative, and that Russia and China already have nuclear missiles, with several others attempting to develop them.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has described Trident as \"vital\" to protecting the UK."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe Queen is urging people to get vaccinated against Covid, telling NHS leaders she hopes those who are reluctant will \"think about other people\". Since receiving her first jab in January, she says she feels \"protected\" and the injection \"didn't hurt at all\". England's vaccine deployment programme chief, Dr Emily Lawson, believes the monarch's comments are an \"incredibly important vote of confidence\".\nDoctors' representatives say allowing NHS staff to recover from dealing with the pandemic is crucial, given there was \"widespread burnout\" even before Covid hit. The British Medical Association Scotland says vacancies for consultants may now be higher than 15% and it will be \"impossible\" for NHS Scotland to recover if senior staff cannot be retained. The Scottish government says the number of consultants has increased by more than 56% since 2006.\nWhile the main thrust of the vaccine rollout has targeted older age groups, nearly 200,000 younger people across the UK classed as extremely clinically vulnerable have had jabs. Two of them told us how they felt about getting their first dose.\nParty politicking and delayed decisions have caused lives to be lost to coronavirus, according to Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann. One year since the first case was reported in Northern Ireland, Mr Swann tells us the public health message has been damaged by politicians failing to stand together.\nDistrict nurse Linda Obiageli Udeagbala was such a strong character, her family almost felt she was \"invincible\", until she died with Covid - aged 60 - this month. Now, her children talk with pride about how Linda's 17 years with the health service inspired them to follow in her footsteps.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWondering when it'll be your turn to get the vaccine?

      "title": "Coronavirus: EU urged to adopt 'vaccine passports'",
      "tags": "Tourism,Austria,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Greece,Coronavirus vaccines,European Union",
      "text": "Greece and Austria are urging other EU states to adopt coronavirus vaccination \"passports\" which could help revive Europe's stricken tourist industry.\nThe idea of such a document, likely to be a certificate, would be to permit those who have been vaccinated to travel freely within the EU.\nThe proposal was put forward during a virtual discussion between EU leaders. \nBut a vaccine passport faces opposition from some of the bloc's 27 member states.\nFrance and Germany say such documents could be premature because data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete. \nThere are also concerns that enabling a vaccinated minority to enjoy foreign travel while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face restrictions would be discriminatory. \nA further complication is the rapid spread of more contagious Covid variants - the English, South African and Brazilian forms - and the possibility of future mutations. So it is more likely that people will need booster jabs to remain protected.\nGreece - as well as Israel - already has digital vaccination certificates, and others such as Denmark and Sweden have talked about developing them. \nGreek Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos told the BBC that a common digital certificate \"is not discriminatory at all\". He argued that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer, but the procedure for them would be slower - they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival.\nGreece and Cyprus have agreed to admit Covid-negative Israeli tourists this summer - those who can prove their status with the Israeli \"green\" digital certificate. \nGreek Tourism Minister Harry Theocharis said a similar deal could be reached with the UK. However, the UK government has not yet approved any vaccination certificate, nor has it given the go-ahead for foreign holidays.\nGreek tourism slumped disastrously last year because of the pandemic. Its revenues fell to \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.5bn; $5bn), from \u20ac18bn in 2019, Reuters news agency reports. Tourism makes up about a fifth of the Greek economy, employing one in five workers. \nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted that \"we're advocating a digital Green Pass, like Israel's\". \n\"That should allow you to prove, on your mobile phone, that you've been tested, inoculated or have recovered [from Covid]. Our goal: to avoid a lengthy lockdown and finally enable freedom to travel again in the EU, and freedom to enjoy events and cuisine.\"\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would take three months to set up a data system for use at the borders and in national healthcare systems, but that most countries agreed that \"a digital vaccination certificate\" could be necessary in the future.\nAs some EU countries now struggle with a third wave of the virus there are tensions over unilateral border restrictions. Germany is the latest to have received a complaint from the European Commission, since it imposed new police checks on the Czech and Austrian borders.\nDuring the virtual meeting on Thursday, EU leaders also discussed how to address concerns over the slow vaccine rollout that has been widely criticised.\nThe Commission - the EU executive - has been under fire over its vaccine procurement strategy. It got into a row with AstraZeneca, because the Anglo-Swedish drug firm fell far short of the first-quarter delivery target.\nSome member states have also implied that the AstraZeneca vaccine is somehow inferior to others - French President Emmanuel Macron said at one point that it might be \"quasi-ineffective\" in the over 65s, without offering any evidence.\nThis has reportedly led to issues of authorities in some countries, such as Italy, reluctant to use supplies of the drug.\nThe Commission still aims to get at least 70% of adults vaccinated in the bloc by mid-September. But so far, the total vaccinated is below 10%.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she felt assured that the target would be met. \"These are 255 million people in the European Union, and if we look at the planned figures, this is a goal we are confident we'll reach,\" she said. \nThe EU is desperately seeking ways to increase vaccine supplies and improve its ability to track new variants, BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly reports. But it is pursuing policies that might pay off in months or years, when voters want answers in days or weeks, he says.  "

      "text": "An athlete who competes for Great Britain says she has been left in a \"state of shock\" after being assaulted at a canalside while training for the Olympics.\nMiddle-distance runner Sarah McDonald had her backside grabbed by a man on a moped while warming up in Birmingham.\nThe 27-year-old said she had received an \"overwhelming response\" to sharing the experience on social media.\nShe added she would be reporting the matter to police.\nMs McDonald, who has represented her country at World and European Championships level, was out with a training partner when the assault occurred on Wednesday.\nShe said in preparation for the 1,500m at the Tokyo Olympics, she had been using a quiet stretch of canal to train \"most days\" during lockdowns.\n\"I think it's quite common to have things shouted at you and catcalls, but I didn't think twice about those,\" she told the BBC. \nBut things took a turn shortly after her training partner shouted to \"watch out for a bike\".\nMs McDonald said: \"I stepped to the left. I wasn't even looking, but the [moped] slowed down and the man on the back grabbed my bum before zooming off into the distance.\" \nShe added: \"If I'd gone to the right-hand-side, I hate to think - they might have pushed me into the canal.\"\nMs McDonald's tweet highlighting the incident prompted other women to share stories of harassment and assault while out running.\n\"I normally don't speak out about these things, but on this occasion I had to make an exception and have been overwhelmed by the response,\" she said. \nA number of Welsh female sprinters have recently reported being verbally abused by strangers as they trained in public rather than at athletics tracks during Covid restrictions.\n[Until the incident] I'd have felt comfortable being on my own,\" said Ms McDonald who added: \"This has been a wake-up call - be vigilant and look after each other.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
