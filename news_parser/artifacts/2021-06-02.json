      "title": "Covid: Zero daily deaths announced in UK for first time",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has announced zero daily Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test for the first time since March 2020.\nThe latest figures also reported another 3,165 new cases, compared with 3,383 on Monday and 2,493 one week ago.\nIt comes amid concern over a recent small rise in cases linked to the variant first identified in India.\nReports of daily deaths are often lower at weekends and at the start of the week.\nThis is because less counting takes place while statisticians are off - and adding in the bank holiday weekend will make this figure less certain still.\nAny deaths that happen on Tuesday will be reported in days to come.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the whole country would be \"so glad\" to hear the news. \nHe added: \"The vaccines are clearly working - protecting you, those around you and your loved ones.  \n\"But despite this undoubtedly good news we know we haven't beaten this virus yet, and with cases continuing to rise please remember hands, face, space and let in fresh air when indoors, and of course, make sure when you can you get both jabs.\"\nMeanwhile, Public Health England's medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said the death figure was \"encouraging\", but echoed the health secretary's call for people to get a vaccine due to rising cases.\nIt is a blessed relief for the government to announce no deaths in their daily figures for the first time since the pandemic got going. \nThere are always ifs and buts. \nToday's deaths tell us what was happening with infections a month ago and, right now, it looks like the virus is on the rise again from its current low base. \nAnd the daily count isn't a perfect picture: some people who died over the bank holiday may have their passing reported on Wednesday.\nIn fact, according to the UK's current definition, deaths within four weeks of a positive test, there was a day with no reportable deaths last summer - on 30 July. \nBut the government did announce some deaths on that day as they were using a different definition at the time. \nThe pandemic is far from over, but this is a unique day in its history to date. \nWe can celebrate it and hope that we'll see more like it in the near future. \nThe UK's daily death rate, the number of people being admitted to hospital and those catching the virus have fallen from a peak reached in January. \nThis comes against the backdrop of the increasing numbers of people receiving the first or second dose of a vaccine. \nMore than a third of the adult population have now received both doses.\nThe latest figures show 25,734,719 people in the UK have had two jabs, while 39,477,158 - some 74.9% of the adult population - have received a first dose.\nHowever, the success of the UK's vaccination programme does not mean that the battle with Covid is over, a scientist advising the government has said.\nEarlier, Prof Adam Finn said the country remained vulnerable as there were still large numbers of unvaccinated people.\nThere have been calls to delay ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 June amid warnings of a third wave.\nBut earlier Downing Street reiterated that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had seen nothing in the data to suggest the plan would need to be postponed.\nA final decision on the last stage of the government's roadmap in England for lifting lockdown - which would remove all limits on how many people you can meet - will be reached on 14 June.\nThe timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. \nIn Scotland, the easing of restrictions has been paused for millions - but rules are to be relaxed in Glasgow from Saturday.\nIn Wales, there is due to be a review on 3 June. In Northern Ireland, some measures were relaxed on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June.  \nThe UK has now reported more than 3,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row.\nThis increase in cases comes amid the spread of the more transmissible Indian variant, now known as Delta - after the World Health Organization announced new names for Covid-19 variants using letters of the Greek alphabet.\nThe Delta variant - also known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to account for up to three quarters of new cases in the UK, and has been linked to a surge in cases in some parts of the country."

      "text": "Residents in parts of north Wales have been urged to be vigilant after a cluster of cases of the Indian Covid variant were confirmed.\nEighteen confirmed or presumed cases of the variant, which originated in India, have been found in Conwy county.\nRichard Firth, of Public Health Wales, said cases had been found in the Llandudno Junction, Llandudno and Penrhyn Bay areas.\nHe said all cases were linked and no outbreak had currently been declared.\nIn a visit to Llandudno, First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were \"under a hundred cases\" of the variant of concern in Wales, including some in schools.\n\"At the moment we feel we're on top of it. We're right to be anxious because the spread across the border, the greater transmissibility - we won't be immune from it in Wales,\" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nEarlier this week Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton confirmed there were about 57 cases of the Indian variant, known formally as B.1.617.2.\nThe Welsh government had previously said most cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although it had been identified in all health board areas except Powys.\nMr Firth, consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales, said the cases in Conwy county showed people \"should not become complacent, even as rates of the virus across Wales remain low\".  \nA mobile testing unit has been set up at Conwy Business Centre until 6 June, he said.\nMr Firth said the current evidence was that the Indian variant was at least as easy to catch as the dominant Kent variant, but it might be slightly more transmissible.\u00a0\nHe said both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were effective against it after two doses."

      "tags": "Tourism,Staycations,Housing market",
      "text": "Residents of a small village fear their community will be lost forever as most of the homes are being used for holiday lets.\nOnly two out of the 50 properties in Cwm-yr-Eglwys, Pembrokeshire, have permanent residents. \nA third is for sale for more than \u00a31m and locals say they are being priced out of the market.\nThey want to see urgent action to protect coastal communities from the rise in second home ownership.\nCwm-yr-Eglwys is one of the most picturesque villages in Pembrokeshire - a sheltered cove with a ruined church on the foreshore, echoing a sea-faring past and a time when sea captains and their families, fishermen and farmers all lived in the village and surrounding area. \nIn recent times, it has become hugely popular as a holiday destination, with the Pembrokeshire coastal path running directly through the village.  \nThere is a small caravan park and about 50 properties, which by now are nearly all holiday homes.\nThere is not much else here - no shop, no pub - only an ice cream kiosk in high season. In winter, the place is deserted but in summer, it is bustling with tourists.    \nBut locals say the community has been lost as each house in turn has become a holiday home.   \nKeith Battrick is a councillor with Dinas Cross community council. He lives nearby and has seen the area change in the 50 years or so since he moved here from Bridgend.  \n\"It's a summer village - winter time it's completely dead. No-one here, just the odd walker - that's it,\" he said. \n\"So it's a sad village really and probably will never change. It makes me sad that the local indigenous community can't afford to live here. \n\"Local children - my son included - who want to move back here, find it hard. Within 10 years there probably won't be anyone local living here - the future of Cwm-yr-Eglwys is as a holiday place.\" \nOf the three properties still lived in all year, one is on the market for \u00a31.3m and the other two are home to people in their 80s. \nNorman Thomas's house sits on the water's edge, overlooking the beach. It was the home he shared with his wife and four children. \nHe is 88 years old and also the only remaining Welsh speaker in the village and said the language would disappear entirely after his time.  \n\"All those houses through the valley have been sold to English people,\" he said. \n\"I'm not against them - they bring work here. I get on with them all. But it's sad that the Welsh can't afford these houses.  \n\"That house over there is on the market for \u00a31.3m. It's ridiculous. The government should have stepped in and stopped these high prices. \n\"We've got to accept this is what it's coming to - there are lots of little places like Cwm-yr-Eglwys - nothing left - there isn't even a pub here.\"\nThe only other permanent residents are the Broughtons - Elizabeth and Harry who are 80 and 85.\nOriginally from Lancashire, they came on holiday to Cwm-yr-Eglwys in the 1960s and fell in love with the place. \nWhen the opportunity came to buy a house in the village, they jumped at the chance. \nTwenty years ago, they moved here permanently and said they did not mind the village being full of holiday homes - it means there are usually people around and they have seen their investment grow beyond all expectation. \n\"We get notes through the door, asking can they rent it or are we selling,\" explained Elizabeth.\n\"Our family would like to keep it but it comes down to pounds, shillings and pence. We are sitting on a goldmine here, no question about it. Very few houses come for sale here so they're pretty sought after.\"    \nHouse prices in Pembrokeshire have risen more than 5% in the past year, with the average home in the county costing \u00a3225,000, well above the Welsh average. \nEstate agents are reporting a surge in demand for rural and coastal properties as people emerge from the pandemic, looking for a new way of life.    \nPembrokeshire also has the second highest number of second homes in Wales - about 9% of the county's housing stock.  \nPeople say all this is not only creating an impossible challenge for those trying to get on to the property market, but also that whole communities are now under threat.     \nMr Battrick said more villages and communities like Cwm-yr-Eglwys would be lost unless action is taken to tackle the issue.\n\"It all goes back to Welsh government - really they should sit down and think really hard about what is happening to villages in Pembrokeshire and all through Wales.  \n\"We will end up eventually with villages like Cwm-yr-Eglwys where there are no local people left living in them and that time is coming quickly I think.\"   \nA Welsh government spokesman, said: \"A large number of second homes in a local community can have a real impact on that community. \n\"Wales is the only UK nation to give local authorities powers to charge higher levels of council tax on both long-term empty properties and second homes. The decision to apply and increase council tax premiums rests with local authorities.\n\"We've also increased the higher rate of land transaction tax, which applies when people buy an additional property. We are looking at what further interventions are available and how our partners can use existing powers.\"\nBob Kilmister, Pembrokeshire council cabinet member for finance said the second homes council tax premium - introduced on 1 April 2017 - meant such owners were charged an extra 50% on top of their usual rates.\n\"The funds are used to increase the supply of affordable housing and enhance the sustainability of local communities.\"\nPhotography by Nick Hartley"

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "Scottish school pupils will have the right to appeal their assessment grades - but could see them revised up or down, the education secretary has said.\nShirley-Anne Somerville told MSPs that there would be a \"direct right of appeal\" for pupils when Higher and National 5 results come out in August.\nBut she said a \"fair, consistent and credible\" system would have to be able to revise grades down as well as up.\nOpposition parties said this made appeals a \"perverse gamble\" for pupils.\nGrades are to be based on teacher judgements - without the use of any algorithms or the past performance of schools - after exams were cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMs Somerville - who recently replaced John Swinney as education secretary - told MSPs that ensuring young people are able to achieve \"fair and credible grades\" despite the ongoing pandemic was the government's \"absolute priority\".\nShe said she took \"very seriously\" the anxiety and concern of some young people, parents and teachers about the model being used, but insisted it was \"the fairest possible\" in a challenging set of circumstances.\nNational 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exams have all been cancelled, with grades to be based on the \"professional judgements\" of teachers and what learners have demonstrated during the school year.\nHowever due to the second national lockdown from the start of the year, much of the assessment work done by teachers has come in the final weeks of term - leading to claims these are \"exams by another name\".\nMs Somerville said parents and pupils have been listened to, adding: \"Awarding qualifications will always be challenging under these circumstances, but we believe that the model we have is the fairest solution in the interests of young people.\"\nAnd she said there would be a \"direct right of appeal\" for all pupils for the first time, which would be free at the point of use.\nGrounds for appeal will include disagreement with the \"academic judgement\" behind grades, administrative or procedural errors or appeals related to the Equality Act, including assessment arrangements.\nAppeals will be assessed by subject specialists, but Ms Somerville said the system must be \"symmetrical\" - meaning they can move grades up, down or leave them unchanged.\nShe said: \"Without symmetry, there would not be a full and fair review of the evidence. This could be perceived as unfair to other learners and raise questions over the credibility of qualifications awarded this year.  \n\"In adopting a symmetrical approach to appeals, judgements at appeal will be made on individual learners' work only and not on an algorithm or on a school's past performance.\"\nOpposition parties were critical of the plans, with Green MSP Ross Greer arguing for a \"no detriment\" approach to appeals where grade could not be revised down.\nHe said lacking such a system made appeals a \"perverse gamble\", adding: \"Schools will support the strongest evidence they have in support of the initial grade - why would they have stronger evidence suitable for an appeal which they chose not to submit in the first place?\n\"It seems the risk of downgrading is increased by an appeals process reliant purely on limited and likely weaker evidence, rather than on the professional judgement of teachers.\"\nMs Somerville replied that it was \"exceptionally rare\" for pupils to have grades reduced on appeal, saying this happened in eight cases out of 13,000 in 2017 and one among 11,000 in 2019.\nThe Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, said it was disappointing that grades could be marked down on appeal, saying this was \"an unnecessary and disempowering barrier to young people\" and could exacerbate anxiety for pupils.\nLiam Fowley, vice chairman of the Scottish Youth Parliament, said the appeals process is \"simply not acceptable\" and fails to take into account the \"exceptional circumstances\" faced by young people during the pandemic. \nThe Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union meanwhile welcomed much of the statement, saying staff were doing \"a quite phenomenal amount of work\" to deliver grades amid the pandemic.\nHowever the NASUWT union - which opposed the current certification model - raised concerns that teachers might have to be available during the summer holidays to engage with the appeals process, despite already facing \"overwhelming and unacceptable levels of workload and anxiety\".\nAppeals are always part of the exams system in Scotland but arguably the role they play this year is much more important. \nNormally appeals are made through schools and for a limited number of reasons, usually a pupil has to have been given a worse grade in the final exam than their teacher predicted. \nAllowing pupils to appeal directly to the SQA and for a wider range of reasons will be welcomed by young people. \nWhat will not be as welcome is the fact that grades can be revised down as well as up. \nThis is normal practice, but many argue that this year that option should be off the table to account for the disruption young people have faced and that this could be seen as downgrading teacher judgement.\nMeanwhile, BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme has found that more than 6,500 pupils have been using a website set up to cheat in this year's assessments. \nIt comes after it was revealed last month that details of assessments were being shared by pupils on TikTok.\nEach school has its own arrangements and set its own assessments, but the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has provided question papers which they can use - and many have been shared on an \"anti SQA\" site online.\nIn some cases, these papers - at Advanced Higher, Higher and National 5 - are being shared in their entirety, along with answers.\nScottish Conservative education spokesman Oliver Mundell said assessment papers were available online \"on an industrial scale\".\n\"Nobody condones attempts to cheat, but SNP ministers were too busy trying to paint a rosy picture instead of tackling the reality for pupils,\" he said.\nA Scottish government spokesman said the SQA had taken action to contact schools \"to ensure that posts were removed as soon as possible and to reiterate the importance of security arrangements around assessment materials\".\nLabour education spokesman Michael Marra said he had been contacted be \"very many\" angry parents, saying the publication of the appeal process was \"well over a month late\" and came 20 days before teachers have to submit grades.\nAnd he said there had been reports of \"widespread variation\" in the way pupils have been assessed, with complaints that some had faced multiple assessments in a short period of time.\nLib Dem MSP Beatrice Wishart said a constituent had told her the current system was the worst model possible, saying it had \"increased stress levels\" for pupils and that there were \"no excuses left\" for the SQA."

      "text": "Holby City, the long-running BBC medical drama, is to end after 23 years, producers have confirmed.\nThe series, created by Tony McHale and Mal Young, first aired in 1999 as a spin-off from another show, Casualty.\nThe BBC announced on Wednesday that the drama will broadcast its final series in March 2022.\nThe corporation said it was \"incredibly proud\" of the show but said it \"had to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities\".\nAround 250 people who work on the show - including actors, camera operators, engineers and hair and make-up professionals - will be affected by the decision.\nHolby City won a Bafta for best continuing drama in 2008 and still regularly attracts more than 3 million viewers.\n\"We are incredibly proud of Holby City but it's with great sadness that we are announcing that after 23 years, the show will end on screen in March of next year,\" the BBC said in a statement.\n\"We sometimes have to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities and as part of the BBC's commitment to make more programmes across the UK, we have taken the difficult decision to bring the show to a close in order to reshape the BBC's drama slate to better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country.\"\nIt added: \"We would like to take this opportunity to thank the amazing team at BBC Studios and all the cast and crew who have been involved in the show since 1999.\n\"Holby has been a stalwart with audiences, delighting millions of viewers each week and winning hundreds of awards with a compelling mix of cutting edge medical stories and explosive personal stories.\n\"We look forward to working with the team over the coming months to ensure that when it ends, Holby goes out on a high.\"\nBoth Holby City, and Casualty are based in the fictional county of Wyvern, South West England.\nBut the bulk of the on-set filming for Holby City takes place at the BBC's Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, as well as shots from around Bristol.\nIn March, the BBC announced its plan to move some of its key departments and staff around the country in order to make the corporation more reflective of the UK as a whole.\n\"Our mission must be to deliver for the whole of the UK and ensure every household gets value from the BBC,\" said director general Tim Davie.\n\"These plans will get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment, and develop and nurture new talent.\"\nRacking up more than 1,000 episodes over 23 series, Holby City has also proved to be a fertile breeding ground for some top acting talent down the years.\nKilling Eve star Jodie Comer received one of her first acting jobs on the programme, as did fellow Bafta-winner and Black Panther actress Letitia Wright, Peaky Blinders actor Joe Cole and Lee Ryan from the boyband Blue.\nAlready-established stars such as Adrian Edmondson and Patsy Kensit were also given parts, while the likes of Maureen Lipman, chat show host Paul O'Grady and comedian Romesh Ranganathan have also appeared as guests.\nThe show has held its place in the BBC One schedule on a Tuesday night for many years, tackling many topical issues along the way.\nOne of its most memorable storylines involved the separation of the conjoined Tan twins, in 2008. The surgery was completed by the show's longest-serving character Dr Ric Griffin, played by Hugh Quarshie.\nTwo years earlier, it showed Professor Elliot Hope's wife Gina travelling to Switzerland to end her life after struggling with motor neurone disease.\nSome of the hospital's fictional staff have themselves also faced health issues. In 2014 young junior doctor Zosia March was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, after suffering a breakdown following her mother's death. Dr Arthur Digby was diagnosed with melanoma two years later.\nThe hospital came under siege during a shooting spree in a 2017 episode.\nThe following year, a special show entitled The Anniversary Waltz helped to mark the 70th anniversary of the National Health Service. It saw characters explaining what the NHS means to them, as they attempted to get an outbreak of norovirus under control.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Alaska: Biden to suspend Trump Arctic drilling leases",
      "tags": "Arctic,Climate change,Environment,Donald Trump,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden's administration will suspend oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge pending an environmental review.\nThe move reverses former President Donald Trump's decision to sell oil leases in the refuge to expand fossil fuel and mineral development.\nThe giant Alaskan wilderness is home to many important species, including polar bears, caribou and wolves.\nArctic tribal leaders have welcomed the move but Republicans are opposed. \nCovering some 19 million acres (78,000 sq km), the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is often described as America's last great wilderness. \nThe push for exploration in the park has been the subject of a decades-long dispute. \nThe oil-rich region is a critically important location for many species and is considered sacred by the indigenous Gwich'in people. \nOne side argues that drilling for oil could bring in significant amounts of money and provide jobs for people in Alaska, while the other has raised concerns over environmental and climate threats.\nDays before his presidential term ended in January, Mr Trump went ahead with the first sale of oil leases in the region's coastal plain as part of his push to develop more domestic fossil fuel production.\nBut the sale received little interest from the oil and gas industry. Companies said they were focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices. Several large US banks said they would not fund exploration in the area. \nIn total, 11 tracts were auctioned off, covering just over 550,000 acres, according to the Washington Post newspaper. The sale raised less than $15m (\u00a311m) - far less than the government had hoped.\nMost went to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state agency. \nWhile estimates suggest around 11 billion barrels of oil lie under the refuge, it has no roads or other infrastructure, making it a very expensive place to drill.\nDuring his campaign Mr Biden pledged to protect the habitat. Once in office, he directed the Interior Department to review the leases. \nIn a statement on Tuesday, the department said it had \"identified defects in the underlying record of decision supporting the leases, including the lack of analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives\", required under environmental law. \nWhite House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said Mr Biden \"believes America's national treasures are cultural and economic cornerstones of our country\". \n\"He is grateful for the prompt action by the Department of the Interior to suspend all leasing pending a review of decisions made in the last administration's final days that could have changed the character of this special place forever,\" she added.\nSince taking office, Mr Biden has signed executive orders aimed at freezing new oil and gas leases on public land, and has pledged to drastically cut carbon emissions. \nBut his administration disappointed environmental groups last week when the Justice Department defended a Trump-era decision to approve a major oil project on Alaska's North Slope in the former Naval Petroleum Reserve.\nArctic tribal leaders praised the decision. \n\"I want to thank President Biden and the Interior Department for recognising the wrongs committed against our people by the last Administration, and for putting us on the right path forward,\" Tonya Garnett, special projects coordinator for the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, said in a statement. \n\"This goes to show that, no matter the odds, the voices of our Tribes matter.\"\nKristen Miller, acting executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said suspending the leases was \"a step in the right direction\". \nBut the Biden administration's move was criticised in a joint statement by Republican senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski along with representative Don Young and Governor Mike Dunleavy.\n\"This action serves no purpose other than to obstruct Alaska's economy and put our energy security at risk,\" said Ms Murkowski, who has represented Alaska in the Senate since 2002. \nMr Dunleavy added that the leases sold by the Trump administration \"are valid and cannot be taken away by the federal government\". \nOil revenues are critical for Alaska, with every resident getting a cheque for around $1,600 every year from the state's permanent fund.\nMr Dunleavy has previously said that opening the refuge for \"responsible resource development\" could \"put more oil in our pipeline, put Alaskans to work, bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities\". \nThe Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority said it was disappointed by the decision, and had no reason to believe that the environmental analysis was inadequate.

      "text": "Newlyweds Boris and Carrie Johnson spent two nights away to mark their nuptials, according to Downing Street. \nThe prime minister and his wife married in secret on Saturday in a small ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. \nA No 10 spokesman would not reveal where the couple went on their mini-honeymoon, but confirmed the PM was now \"back at work\".\nQuestions arose after the Catholic ceremony, as Mr Johnson has been divorced twice.\nBut the Roman Catholic Church can allow divorcees to remarry if the previous marriages were outside the Roman Catholic Church.\nAsked by reporters if Mr Johnson was a Catholic or if he considered the wedding a breakthrough for those in the faith, a No 10 spokesman said they were not questions he had asked the PM. \nThey did, however, confirm that the prime minister had paid for the whole wedding himself. \nMr Johnson was the first prime minister to get married while in office in nearly 200 years, with 30 guests invited to the ceremony at short notice.\nDowning Street said the couple would celebrate again with family and friends next summer, with a longer honeymoon also delayed until then.\nOne of the first roles of the new Mrs Johnson - who has confirmed she will take her husband's surname - will be hosting the spouses of political leaders when they gather in Cornwall for the G7 Summit later this month. \nThe Times reported that the bride rented three \"decoy\" dresses to ensure the ceremony remained secret.\nThe newspaper said that, along with the white dress she wore for the ceremony - designed by Athens-based Christos Costarellos - she hired three other outfits from ecofashion business My Wardrobe HQ without saying she would be wearing one to be married, concerned that a delivery of a white dress to No 10 would arouse suspicion. \nSacha Newall, who co-founded My Wardrobe HQ in 2018, told the paper: \"We didn't know what it was for. We were just asked to supply some items. \n\"Then we saw what happened this weekend. It was all a bit of a surprise.\"\nBut amongst the excitement and desire for details, the question of the prime minister's faith - and whether he received any special treatment by the Church - remained. \nFather Mark Drew, assistant priest at St Joseph's Church in Penketh, Warrington, said he has previously had to tell Catholic couples going through a divorce they are not able to remarry in the Church.\n\"It looks to them - rightly or wrongly - as if the Church is applying double standards and I do fear that this decision does make the Church look bad.\"\nNo 10 would not comment on the debate, but an archdiocese spokesperson told the Irish Times that Mr and Mrs Johnson were \"both parishioners of the Westminster Cathedral parish and baptised Catholics\".\nThey added: \"All necessary steps were taken, in both Church and civil law, and all formalities completed before the wedding.\""

      "text": "The majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school, but two-thirds are concerned about the amount of learning lost. \nA survey by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals some parents think that their child will never catch-up.\nIt shows parents want policies to promote children's wellbeing as well as their academic learning.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson has promised no child's prospects should be \"blighted by the pandemic.\"\nAs schools in England prepare to reopen to all pupils on Monday for the first time since early January, 90% of parents say they would send their children back, even if it was not compulsory. \nParents are much more confident about children going back to school this time than they were last summer, says the financial think thank, when only two thirds of parents supported the idea of going back into the classroom.\nAmong parents who are still reluctant, health concerns about the pandemic continue to be the most important reason - with nearly half of these parents saying the Covid-19 case rate is the key factor.\nNearly 6,000 parents across England were asked their views in the last week of February, as the full reopening of schools was approaching.\nThe youngest pupils have already returned to school in Scotland and Wales. \nSome primary school pupils in Northern Ireland also return to school on Monday. \nThe survey provides evidence on how parents view the the impact of so much lost time in school.\nOverall, 65% of primary school parents and 68% of those with secondary school children are concerned that their child has lost out on learning. \nAmong these worried secondary school parents, 9% believe their child's education will never be able to fully recover from the adverse effects the pandemic.\nThe Department for Education recently announced a further \u00a3700m package to help pupils catch-up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools.\nSupport for catch-up plans is very high among parents, the IFS survey suggests, with over 90% in favour, with tutoring the most popular policy.\nThere is much less support among parents for a longer school day, an extended term or repeating school years, with disadvantaged families less likely to be keen. \nA large majority of parents (83%) are also in favour of policies to promote children's wellbeing. Most believed that in-class activities - such as arts, creative writing or spending time outdoors - would make the biggest difference. \nAround a quarter of parents prioritised greater access to mental health services.\nChristine Farquharson, IFS senior research economist, said: \"While close to half of those concerned think that the damage will be relatively short-lived, one in 10 secondary school parents think their child will never catch up. \n\"While the tutoring programmes that the government has emphasised are hugely popular with parents, it is hard to believe that the \u00a31.7bn currently allocated to the recovery is anywhere near enough to meet the scale of this challenge.\"\nA DfE spokeswoman said: \"We know the pandemic has had a significant impact on children and young people, which is why it's been our priority to get pupils back to face-to-face education.  \n\"Our new Mental Health in Education Action Group will look at how we best support children and young people's mental wellbeing as they return to education settings, in addition to the mental health training we have funded for teachers to help them respond to emotional and mental health pressures.\""

      "tags": "Abortion,Asia,China",
      "text": "China's decision to allow couples to have up to three children continued to dominate discussion online as people debated if it had come too late.\nThe announcement came as census data showed a steep decline in birth rates. \nMany - mostly millennials - wondered how the announcement sat with plans to delay retirement ages in the country which were also announced on Monday. \nOthers called for compensation for the trauma their families suffered for wanting more children in the past.\nUnder China's strict one-child policy which was introduced in 1979, families caught flouting the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions.\nCampaigners say it also led to issues like female infanticide, and the under-reporting of female births.\nA  number of descriptions of what it was like for families during that time have now emerged online in response to the new policy. \nOne person on China's microblogging service Weibo claimed his mother was forced to get an IUD after giving birth to him as he was a second child, adding that to this day she still gets infections from it.\n\"The policy is just a cold notice - it doesn't look at the kind of distress it has caused people. Everyone has become reduced to data, rather than people who deserve to be respected and seen,\" he wrote on Weibo under the pseudonym Chillsyrup.\nMany also recalled the story of Feng Jiamei who was made to undergo a forced abortion in the seventh month of her pregnancy as she could not pay the fine for having a second child.\nCity officials apologised after photos showing Ms Feng and her foetus shocked internet users.\nAnother person known as Jia Shuai wrote that as an illegal child growing up in the countryside, he remembered having to jump into ponds to hide from family planning officials. \n\"If you could not pay the fines, some officials would clear your house and take your animals away. What a bizarre memory,\" he wrote. \nYet another user claimed her younger sister was still alive only because a compassionate doctor had let their mother escape from the hospital, after she was called in to have an abortion while eight months pregnant. \nMeanwhile celebrated filmmaker Zhang Yimou and his wife - who were fined a hefty $1.2m (\u00a3842,850) in 2014 for violating the country's one-child policy - also commented on the new announcement. \n\"Finished the task ahead of time,\" the couple wrote on Weibo, along with the flexing arm emoji. \nHuman rights organisation Amnesty International said the policy, like its predecessors, was still a violation of sexual and reproductive rights.\n\"Governments have no business regulating how many children people have. Rather than 'optimising' its birth policy, China should instead respect people's life choices and end any invasive and punitive controls over people's family planning decisions,\" said the group's China team head, Joshua Rosenzweig.\nBut much of the criticism on the new policy came from Chinese millennials, who complained they were the \"awkward\" generation caught in the middle. \n\"For those born after the 1980s and 1990s - we can't catch a break. The government is pressuring us to have more babies, but at the same time, they want us to keep working for longer. What kind of life is this?\" one person asked. \nFor more than four decades, China's retirement age has remained unchanged at 60 for men and 55 for women. But on Monday China said it would phase in delays in retirement ages, though it did not provide details.\n\"I don't even want one child, let alone three,\" another commented. \nUntil more details are announced, many on social media are sceptical that the policy change will actually do much to boost birth rates.\nWhen China scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016 to replace it with a two-child limit, it failed to lead to a sustained upsurge in births. \n\"If relaxing the birth policy was effective, the current two-child policy should have proven to be effective too,\" Hao Zhou, a senior economist at Commerzbank, told the Reuters news agency on Monday."

Government records indicate that the firm had been dissolved three years previously. \nBusiness Insider reported that a spokesman for the company had previously suggested it could be a mistake. \nThe second donation was made in June 2017 by a company called Unionist Buildings Limited which had apparently been dissolved in January of that year. \nThe Electoral Commission confirmed it had received Ms Dodds' letter and says it will \"respond shortly\".

      "text": "Scotland will follow England's example and lift its working from home guidance. \nPeople across the rest of the UK are still advised to work remotely wherever possible. \nFrom Monday 31 January, the government will no longer recommend home working wherever possible.\nInstead, employers are being asked to let workers return gradually. It wants workers to spend some time in the office and some time at home. \nA wholesale \"mass return\" to offices next week could risk pushing up infection levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 January, Boris Johnson said that the government was no longer asking staff to work from home.\nHe said people \"should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office\". \nThe government had reintroduced its guidance to work remotely when it tightened Covid regulations on 8 December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. \nHowever, that guidance did also say that people should continue travelling to work if they needed \"to access equipment necessary for their role, or where their role must be completed in person\".  \nEmployers were also told to consider letting people come to work if they had a \"challenging home working environment\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers said that more people working from home would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they didn't tell employers to impose home working, but instead asked them to support it \"where possible\".\nIn Wales, employers are also encouraged to let people work from home where possible. Guidance says staff should not be \"required or placed under pressure to return\" to the workplace unless there's a clear business need. Employers could be fined up to \u00a310,000 for failing to allow staff to work from home where it is \"reasonably practicable to do so\".\nFrom 28 January, the requirement to work from home moves from law to guidance. \nLatest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020, up from 27% the previous year.\nIn the last week of November 2021, seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. \nIn the same week, one in seven said they had been working at home and travelling to work.\nAlthough social distancing limits no longer apply across most UK workplaces businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks to staff and customers. \nEmployers must follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. \nSafety measures can include:\nFace-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England, where they will cease to be required in any public space on 27 January. \nRegular lateral flow testing remains widespread across the NHS and other parts of the public and private sector.\nNorthern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have already introduced Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. \nHowever, England will scrap its mandatory Covid certification scheme from Thursday 27 January, although venues will be able to keep checking customers' status on a voluntary basis if they wish. \nThere is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIf employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nWorking from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce social exposure, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nIt greatly limits face-to-face contact both with colleagues and on public transport.\nAs such, Sage says it has a \"strong impact\" against virus transmission and the R number, which represents a disease's ability to spread.\nMuch of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.\nWearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMinisters have pledged extra cash to help schools in England tackle the disruption to education caused by the Covid pandemic. The promised \u00a31.4bn in extra funding will be used to provide 100 million hours of tutoring and additional teacher training and development. Vowing that \"no child is left behind\", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the programme was the \"next step in our long-term catch-up plan\". But teachers' unions have criticised the plan, with one saying education recovery \"cannot be done on the cheap\".\nThe state of Victoria has extended its current coronavirus restrictions for another week due to an outbreak in its largest city, Melbourne. Six new cases were reported on Wednesday, taking the total number to 60. People living in Melbourne will be required to stay at home except for going out to do essential tasks - including getting a Covid vaccination - until 10 June. Restrictions will be more relaxed for rural towns. The Victorian outbreak marks the biggest case increase in Australia since October.\nThe coronavirus test and trace programme in Wales will continue to operate until March 2022 to tackle potential outbreaks, amid concern over the variant first detected in India. So far there have been fewer than 100 cases of the so-called Indian variant - now called Delta - but the Welsh health minister said it would be \"very difficult\" to stop it spreading from England. According to the Welsh government, contact tracers have reached 99.7% of all positive cases eligible for follow up since the service was introduced last June.\nOfficial figures show UK house prices have been increasing at their fastest rate for more than a decade despite the country being gripped by a pandemic. Potential first-time buyers and movers may have more of a sinking feeling, as some watch the likelihood of owning move further out of reach. One notable boom area has been Cornwall, which has seen more searches on a leading property website than London. The reason for that is many buyers are engaged in a race for space. They want bigger homes with room to live and work, as well as a garden and easy to reach coast or countryside. The trouble is, they are in short supply.\nOne of the defining developments of the pandemic has been the rise of the Zoom call. Family catch-ups, business meetings, and virtual pub quizzes have all been held on the popular video conferencing platform - with a marked effect on that company's bottom line. Zoom says it's had a \"very strong\" start to the year, and profits are up from $27m (\u00a319m) in 2020 to $227m (\u00a3160m). But analysts are warning that Zoom could struggle to stay relevant as vaccines continue to roll-out and social distancing ends.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you're thinking about going abroad from the UK, you can find out what the rules are for the four nations here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "A cluster of the Indian variant of Covid-19 is \"very serious\" and could affect the easing of restrictions in Wales, the health minister has said. \nEluned Morgan is \"very concerned\" the cluster in Conwy county is heading towards community transmission.\nThere are now 35 cases of the variant - renamed the Delta variant by the World Health Organization - in Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay. \nPeople have been urged to get tested, even if they do not have symptoms.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board has asked those without any Covid symptoms to get a lateral flow test at a mobile unit at Ysgol Awel y Mynydd in Llandudno Junction.\nThose in the area who do have symptoms have been asked to attend Conwy Business Centre for a more accurate PCR test.\nConwy county now has the second highest Covid rate in Wales.\nUpdated figures on the spread of the Delta variant are expected to be published by Public Health Wales later this week.\nThe UK government has said up to three-quarters of new cases in England could be of the variant, which has been renamed Delta by the World Health Organization.\nBaroness Morgan said the situation in Llandudno could affect further easing of restrictions across Wales.\n\"This is becoming very serious, we need to make sure that we try and nip this in the bud in that particular area and obviously all of this will play into how we assess the situation on Friday,\" she said.\n\"I don't think we'd define it quite yet as community transmission, but it's on its way to becoming that and that's why we really need people in the area to co-operate with us\u2026 to make sure that we can try and suppress this particular variant.\n\"The last thing we want to see is this spreading across the whole of Wales,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nShe said the 35 cases of the Delta variant had been identified through the Test, Trace, Protect scheme, which she said had been a \"phenomenal success\" throughout the pandemic and was being extended until March. \n\"We do know where those 35 people are and we are tracing their contacts,\" she said.\n\"It's been a highly successful programme so far. It's one of the key weapons in our arsenal in our efforts to curb the spread of Covid.\"\nAn additional \u00a332m will go towards the scheme, which has reached 99.7% of all positive cases eligible for follow up since it was introduced last June, the Welsh government said. \nHelen Alefounder, a GP in Conwy, said the potential for social mixing during half term was \"slightly worrying\".\n\"What's reassuring is we've isolated these cases, we know where they are and we can make sure that those patients are isolated and [we can] try and prevent the spread of the virus any further,\" she said.\n\"But it is half term... we've got a lot of visitors in Wales and we just need to make sure we're maintaining our social distancing and keeping to the rules because otherwise there will be an increase in cases. We don't want to go back to where we were a few months ago. \n\"It's really important for everyone to remember that this is still very real, the virus is still out there but we can prevent this. We can stop the cases from increasing,\" she said.\nConwy's Covid case rate is currently the 163rd highest in the UK.\nFor context, where we have had clusters in recent weeks - Bridgend, Newport and Monmouthshire - these have all eased off now and they never got beyond 30 cases per 100,000. \nAll, including Conwy, according to the most recent surveillance, have had raised numbers of under-25s; the Bridgend and Monmouthshire clusters were linked to schools in Porthcawl and Abergavenny.\nConwy breaks down into 15 communities. Three of these are among the 23 across Wales which have shown any positive test numbers greater than two in the past week. \nThe other 12 local areas are among the 94% in Wales with fewer than two cases in the last seven days.\nThe lag in test results being published means it will be a few more days before the Conwy cluster starts to show up properly in the figures. The county's case rate stands at just under 20 but it has been below the 50 cases per 100,000 threshold for two months. \nDuring the second wave in January, Conwy reached 221 cases per 100,000. That is the third lowest peak of any local authority area of Wales, after Anglesey and Gwynedd."

And, he said, if he'd had one when he was attacked three years ago, it would have saved him the stress of testifying against his attacker in court.\n\"Every time a job comes on the radio you think, 'Is it going to be another one of those jobs?' You just never know. \n\"All four members of staff got up for work that morning to help people -  come in, do their job, care for people and then go home to their families.

Recordings can then be shared with the police, and used in court as evidence. \nNHS England medical director Steve Powis, said: \"Initial trial findings show the cameras make staff feel safer, and can assist in de-escalating situations where staff are faced with someone being aggressive towards them.\"\nBut in the North East Ambulance Service - one of the pilot areas along with the London Ambulance Service - assaults actually increased. \nThe cameras were only trialled with small numbers of people, though.\nHealth minister Nadine Dorries said the trial of the cameras helped to reduce incidents.\nShe added: \"We have already doubled the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker and continue to take action to protect staff against violence, aggression and discrimination.\"\nAmbulance services in Wales and Northern Ireland both said they were considering introducing body cameras for staff.\nThe Scottish ambulance service declined to comment.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has caved in to a legal action over providing vitamins and milk to some of the UK's poorest children. \nLawyers for a family denied weekly vouchers worth \u00a34.25 had challenged the policy as discriminatory. \nThey said the ban unfairly affected ethnic minority children whose parents were not fully settled in the UK. \nThe challenge concerned the \"Healthy Start\" scheme supplying milk, vitamins and vegetables in England and Wales.\nIt explicitly aims to improve the diets of babies and toddlers in the poorest families in England in Wales - and so reduce the likelihood of lifelong chronic bad health. \nHowever, under immigration rules, parents who do not have a final settled status in the UK - even if they are legally living or working in the country - are banned from receiving any of the UK's mainstream benefits. \nIn practice, the benefits ban applies to almost all migrants - including the partners or close relatives of British citizens - until they are later granted full rights of settlement.\nThat legal bar to benefits meant applications from families for the Healthy Start milk and vitamin vouchers were automatically rejected by the Department of Health, even if they met the poverty test at the heart of the scheme. \nLawyers for a family with a one-year-old launched a judicial review of this rule. \nThe child's mother was lawfully living in the UK and her household income was 40% lower than the threshold for claiming benefits.\nBut officials denied her vouchers because of her non-permanent immigration status, despite the baby having British citizenship through the father, her ex-partner. \nHer lawyers argued that the Department of Health's refusal to consider the mother's case unlawfully discriminated against children from black and ethnic minority backgrounds - and it was also contrary to the scheme's aims of improving the health of the poorest in society. \nIn February, the High Court ordered that the case against the policy overseen by Mr Hancock should go to a full hearing - but ministers have now given up fighting the challenge. \nOfficials have been told to provide the family with vouchers and have committed to a full review of how the scheme works to ensure it is not discriminatory. \nOlivia Halse, the claimants' solicitor, said the victory means that hundreds, if not thousands, of children previously denied access to the support would now be eligible. \n\"This is a great outcome for some of the most disadvantaged children in our society who should have never been excluded from accessing this essential support in the first place,\" said Ms Halse.\n\"We hope this extension will go some way toward tackling health inequalities and child food poverty in the UK and help provide these children with a healthy start in life.\"\nThe outcome of the case is the latest in a string of climb downs by the government over the impact of the benefits ban on children born to lawfully-resident migrant parents. \nLast year, the government extended the free schools meal scheme to cover all migrant children as it faced a looming High Court challenge - and in 2019 it similarly extended funding for nursery school places. \nThe Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.

      "text": "Amazon is to expand its Covid testing lab facilities in the UK as the pandemic continues.\nThe online giant said this was to benefit employees and UK public health.\nHowever, analysts said it could also provide business opportunities in the health sector and buff up Amazon's reputation after questions over working conditions.\nAmazon recently moved into the online pharmacy business in the US for subscribers to its Prime service.\nIn 2020, the online retailing giant set up laboratories in Kentucky and in Greater Manchester to process employees' PCR tests.\nThe lab in Manchester has processed 900,000 test samples to date.\nThe test results are anonymous and will be shared with Public Health England once the lab is approved for sequencing.\nIts coronavirus response efforts have so far cost the company $11.5bn (\u00a38.1bn). \nTom Forte, managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Amazon could convert staff Covid-19 testing and healthcare clinics for consumer use.\n\"We believe Covid-19 inspired Amazon to accelerate its healthcare-related efforts, by necessity.\n\"That said, we had long believed healthcare was an attractive opportunity for Amazon given its large market size and chances for the company to both improve the customer experience and lower the costs.\"\nThere are very few companies in the world who could have decided to build a state of the art diagnostics lab and have it functioning within months, but Amazon is one of them. \nWhile the company insists that at the moment this site is purely to help keep their staff safer at work, they are sending out a very clear message.\nThey are able to process medical diagnostics and feed that information into public health agencies.\nRight now this multimillion-pound site in Salford is only testing for Covid-19, but it's unlikely to be left idle after the pandemic.\nAmazon's most valuable product is the information they already hold about their customers, and medical data is a very rich pool indeed to be dipping their toes into.\nLab director Luke Meredith joined Amazon from the World Health Organization and works alongside 70 Amazon lab technicians at the site in Wardley, Manchester.\n\"What we decided during the Covid outbreak is that we really needed to maximise protection for safe working in the fulfilment centres,\" he told the BBC.\nAt the moment, the two sites are processing samples from staff across Europe and the Americas, tapping into the company's logistics network.\nNeil Travis, North West regional director for Amazon UK, said: \"For now, we are focused on the safety of our colleagues.\"\nJames Moar, lead analyst for Juniper Research, thinks that Amazon's expansion of its testing laboratories is \"intended to enhance Amazon's reputation\", although he said Amazon would be unlikely to pass up a business opportunity.\nThere have been a number of controversies about how Amazon treats its staff.\nOn Wednesday, a report found that staff at its warehouses in the US are injured at a higher rate than those doing similar jobs at other companies' warehouses.\nEarlier this year, the company apologised for falsely denying that its drivers were having to urinate in plastic bottles.                                         \nAnd during the first wave of the pandemic, the company was accused of \"cutting corners\" on Covid safety, which it denied.\nHowever, Mr Moar thinks that having the laboratories could be useful to Amazon in the future.\n\"Amazon has tried to get into healthcare in a number of ways,\" he said.\n\"This is basically Amazon saying that as well as providing the facilities for its employees' healthcare, it's a demonstration that they can work to provide healthcare services.\n\"This means they've already got some groundwork to show any potential partners.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,UK aid",
      "text": "The government is facing a growing rebellion that could force it to reverse cuts to foreign aid.\nThirty Tory rebels, including former prime minister Theresa May, have now promised to back a bid to increase aid spending in 2022.\nNext week's planned Commons vote will come in the same week the government hosts world leaders at the G7 summit. \nA minister said despite the \"temporary\" cut, the UK remained \"one of the largest donors of aid in the world\".\nThe rebels want to restore aid spending to 0.7% of national income from next January, after ministers reduced it to 0.5% this year, a cut of almost \u00a34bn.\nThe group is hoping to use a technical procedure, involving an amendment to a new law setting up the UK's new \"high risk\" science agency, to bring about the change.\nThe aid reduction has meant millions of pounds less is being spent on supporting girls' education, reproductive health, clean water, HIV/AIDS, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and Syria, and hundreds of other projects. \nCharities warned that millions of women and children would not receive food and support and have predicted that more than 100,000 people could die as a result of the government's decision. \nThe United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has described the aid cuts as a \"death sentence\". \nThe reductions to the overseas development assistance budget were introduced by the government this year without a vote, in part because ministers feared defeat at the hands of MPs.\nInitially ministers conceded the change would require a change to the 2015 law, passed during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, which made the 0.7% target legally binding.\nBut in March, Boris Johnson argued a change would not be required because the current law allows the target to be temporarily missed in exceptional circumstances. \nThe government has promised to restore spending to the 0.7% level \"when the fiscal situation allows\" - but has not specified a date. \nCritics have argued the decision to cut spending without changing current legislation is unlawful, and have been looking for an opportunity to test opinion in the Commons.\nOn Thursday, former Tory premier Theresa May, her former de facto deputy PM Damian Green, former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb and former defence minister Johnny Mercer joined those supporting the rebellion.\nIt means there are now 30 Tory MPs supporting the amendment, including seven former cabinet ministers.\nFormer International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell - who is leading the rebellion - said he was confident of finding the 45 or so Conservative rebels needed to defeat the government. \nHe said more Conservative MPs were coming forward to support the amendment to \"stand by\" the party's manifesto promise to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Mitchell tabled his amendment to the Advanced Research and Invention Agency Bill. \nThe bill, which would set up a new agency designed to come up with innovative policy, is due to receive detailed scrutiny in the Commons on Monday.\nMr Mitchell's technical amendment would oblige the new agency to make up any shortfall in aid spending if the government were to miss the 0.7% target.\nWhitehall officials are studying whether the amendment is likely to be considered within the scope of the bill. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide on Monday whether it should be put to a vote.\nOne of the Conservative rebels, Caroline Nokes, said the group had put \"an awful lot of work\" into designing their amendment, and she was \"very hopeful\" it would be selected.\nBut, speaking to BBC News, she added the group was \"entirely in the hands of the Speaker at this point\".\nLabour's shadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said the aid cut had \"risked lives\" during the pandemic and undermined the UK's credibility as a \"leader on the greatest global challenges\".\nShe urged ministers to \"do the right thing\" ahead of the G7 summit and reinstate the UK's commitment to spending 0.7% on foreign aid.\nResponding to the move, Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins said the cut was a \"small temporary reduction,\" and the UK still remained \"one of the largest donors of aid in the world\".\nShe told Sky News: \"The prime minister has made clear that this is a temporary measure.\n\"In 2019, no one could have foreseen the extent of the pandemic and the measures we were going to have to take as a country in order to deal with this; it has had a huge impact on our economy.\"\n\"So we've had to make some very, very difficult decisions,\" she added. \n\"I do believe we still have a record of which we can very much hold our head up high in terms of international development.\""

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,Personal finance,UK fire safety",
      "text": "The government will miss a June deadline to complete applications for \u00a35bn of funding to remove flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.\nThe BBC understands most managing agents who administer tower blocks with the cladding are refusing to sign contracts with the government. \nAgents say the contracts only cover cladding problems.\nThis would make them liable for other fire safety defects, they say.\nNigel Glen, head of the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA), which represents hundreds of blocks, said making them responsible for other fire safety faults would \"render companies insolvent\".\nThe ongoing dispute is delaying work to make dangerous buildings safe.\n\"We represents hundreds of blocks in this scheme and none of them have signed. This has major implications and affects hundreds of thousands of people,\" said Mr Glen. \n\"We want to start the projects, but by signing that contract the managing agent becomes liable for those costs not covered by funding, and as a director you can't sign anything that as it would put your company technically insolvent,\" he said. ARMA represents 325 managing agents, who act for freeholders across the UK. \nThe deadline for applications to the government's \u00a35.1bn Building Safety Fund is 30 June. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has now said it will allow applications to be processed beyond that deadline on a case by case basis. \nA spokesperson for MHCLG said the managing agents' interpretation of the contract is \"fundamentally flawed\".\nMeanwhile leaseholders across the UK said they are stuck in limbo facing life changing bills. \n\"It's nearly four years since Grenfell, and this building is nowhere near having any works done to make it safe,\" said Stephen Squires, 42, who lives in a flat with flammable cladding in Manchester's Green Quarter. \nIt will cost an estimated \u00a32.7m to make Stephen's flat and the hundreds of others at Britton House safe. The block is eligible for funding but the managing agents HomeGround are disputing the terms.\n\"The fact that we are so close to funding, and it is being held up, it's soul destroying. We want to get on with our lives. It doesn't matter how much money the government make available unless the agreement is signed we are stuck and trapped. We are stuck in the dark.\"\n\"We've all been issued with bills of \u00a320,000 to cover fire alarms and remediation. Until the government funding is in place we have to pay for that,\" added Mr Squires.\nA spokesperson for HomeGround said: \"We have been working alongside ARMA, managing agents, other freeholders, as well as engaging with various leaseholder cladding groups who all share our concerns, to explain to MHCLG why these agreements are not workable and cannot be signed in their current form, but the government is yet to address the remaining issues. \n\"The changes we have proposed are crucial to ensuring that funding can be released to enable remediation work to start and that residents are sufficiently protected from the costs.\"\nNearly four years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. Aside from the financial strain, the cladding crisis is taking its toll on the mental health of those trapped in dangerous buildings.\nAlison Hills, 40, bought a one bed flat in St Albans, Hertfordshire, in March 2018 for \u00a3300,000. It was financed by the sale of the family home when her mother died. A range of fire safety faults were discovered months later. \n\"I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. My mental health has been in bits. Everything that my father and I ever worked for has been taken away in an instance, and it's not our fault,\" said Ms Hills.\nOpus House, which consists of 44 flats, has problems with cladding, insulation, missing fire breaks and balconies. The estimated remediation bill is \u00a37m but only \u00a31m of that is related to the removal and replacement of the cladding. The government's Building Safety Fund will only cover a fraction of the work needed, but the managing agents, FirstPort, are yet to sign the funding contract. \nMs Hills, who works as a solicitor, warns that if the contract doesn't get signed leaseholders could be liable for \u00a3150,000 each. \n\"It's an absolute disgrace. People are going to become bankrupt. I've had to move out because of the impact on my mental health. You have to sit here in a flammable flat 24 hours a day, especially in lockdown, knowing that you aren't safe,\" said Ms Hills. \nFirstPort said it is doing all it can to support homeowners and residents at Opus House. \"The current Building Safety Fund agreement exposes signatories to potential open-ended liabilities they do not otherwise hold, and this is the case for resident management companies, freeholders and managing agents across the country,\" a FirstPort spokesperson said.\nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: \"This interpretation (of the contract) is fundamentally wrong - the clause relating to other remediation work ensures that the removal of dangerous cladding is not delayed by funding shortfalls.\"\n\"It concerns only non-cladding works which applicants choose to carry out, as part of the same project as cladding work covered by Government funding.\n\"Building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner, and we expect them to cooperate with their contractors to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely, effectively and promptly.\"\nPrivately owned tower blocks:\n(Source - MHCLG)"

      "tags": "Pensioners,Personal finance,Pensions",
      "text": "Tens of thousands of elderly female pensioners are set to miss out on life changing payments, the BBC has learned.\nAngela Carr, 77, from Brampton, near Carlisle, believes she is owed up to 14 years of lost state pension. \nBut a law change in 2008 means she will only be able to recoup one year's worth of the money owed. \n\"It just doesn't seem right when so much time and money has been lost,\" the farmer's wife, from Cumbria, told the BBC.\nThe money \"would make all the difference in the world,\" she said.\nAn estimated 200,000 female pensioners are collectively owed up to \u00a32.7bn after the under-payment of state pensions due to an error at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\nThe problem relates to the \"old\" state pension system where married women who had a poor pension in their own right could claim a 60% basic state pension based on their husband's record of contributions. \nA review is taking place to trace those affected by systemic failures to automatically award these pension rises, stretching back to 1992.\nBut only some women are being fully repaid. Others, like Mrs Carr, will only be able to claim for 12 months of missed payments.  \nShe's set to miss out because her husband retired before a rule change in March 2008. The government said it wrote to these pre-2008 women at the time asking them to apply for an increase to their pensions. Those the BBC has spoken to said they received no such letter. \n\"I should be getting 60% of my husband's basic pension. I am receiving just over \u00a338 a week, but I should have been getting \u00a382 a week,\" Mrs Carr told the BBC. \"14 years of lost pension, to only be able to claim back one year's worth, in the region of \u00a32,000, it seems very unfair,\" she added. \nMrs Carr contacted the DWP twelve weeks ago about her case but is yet to receive a response. \nA former pensions minister, Sir Steve Webb, a partner at consultants Lane Clark and Peacock, first highlighted the problem and estimates more than 50,000 women will not be fully repaid. \nHe said: \"It is simply unacceptable that so many married women have been unnecessarily getting by on a reduced pension simply because the system is so complex that they were unaware of the need for a further claim.\"\nSir Steve described the DWP's efforts to contact women, including sending forms to their husbands, as \"bordering on the laughable\".\nHe said: \"Women who have lost out on twelve years or more of pension through no fault of their own should not be limited to twelve months of backdating.\"\nWomen have told the BBC they called the DWP suspecting they weren't being paid the right amount. Some were paid as little as \u00a31 a week. But they were repeatedly told it was correct. It wasn't. For others, who are now entitled to reclaim the full amount, it has come too late. \nFor two decades Rosemary Chattell, 97, from Tarporley, in Cheshire, was underpaid. \nWidowed in 1999, she should have automatically got a proportion of her husband's pension when he died. It was her son, John Chattell, 67, who first suspected something was wrong. On the fourth time of asking, the DWP agreed to investigate. The scale of the error came as shock.\n\"The lady from the DWP rang me back and said 'are you sitting down? Your mother is owed a substantial about of money.' She came back with a figure - \u00a3107,852. It's an amazing amount of money,\" said Mr Chattell. \n\"It does make me feel sad, all the other things she should could have done in her life if she had that extra pension. But also other people out there, in the same position, but don't know they are owed all of this money.\"\nMrs Chattell has dementia and is in a care home. The money is now helping to pay for her full time care. \n\"It would have made a big difference, but she'll never know about it, she is too far gone to appreciate it. You shouldn't have to fight for what's rightfully yours. Everybody pays in to the system during their lives, through their income and tax, you should get that back,\" said Mr Chattell. \nA DWP spokesperson said: \"The action we are taking now will correct the historical underpayments that have been made by successive governments and anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed.\n\"Married women whose husbands reached State Pension age after them, but before 17 March 2008, are required by law to make a separate claim, and application forms were provided four months before they reached State Pension age.\"\nThe law limits the backdating for this group to a period of 12 months. This is a long standing element of social security law and the BBC understands there are no plans to change this position.\nFormer pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann said many women are struggling to make ends meet in retirement. \n\"Somehow we have this underclass of often elderly female pensioners who and are living on far less than they should be,\" she said. \"The astonishing thing is, this has been going on for many years, and no one knew. We still haven't had an explanation about what went wrong.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Britain's love of queuing helped the UK coronavirus vaccine rollout, the health secretary has said, as jabs were given \"according to need, not ability to pay\".\nMatt Hancock said there had been no \"special treatment, no queue-jumping\" for politicians, footballers, or royalty, which helped show the system was \"fair\".\nHe also confirmed that three in four UK adults have now had their first jab.\nBut concerns remain over rising cases.\nReflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford, the health secretary said it had been important for the public to know others couldn't \"buy their way up the queue\".\n\"Prince William, our future king, waited in that same line for his jab a couple of weeks after me - no special treatment, no queue-jumping,\" he said.\nMr Hancock also said the government was in talks with AstraZeneca to secure a future version of its jab adapted to better tackle the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.\nAny altered vaccine would need to be approved by the medicines regulator, AstraZeneca said.\nThe health secretary admitted \"a few eyebrows were raised\" after he revealed the Hollywood film Contagion helped him shape the UK vaccine programme.\n\"When I watched that film, a penny did drop for me... that the power of the vaccine would be so great that we would have to think very hard about who to protect and in what order,\" he said.\nFamous faces endorsing the vaccines - including the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and various sports stars - helped encourage take-up, he said.\nBut he said the \"straight-talking approach\" of England's deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam was equally key in helping to \"build public confidence\".\nSpeaking to counterparts running vaccine programmes around the world, he added that while he was aware \"this isn't a vaccine world cup\", confidence in Covid vaccines has been \"sky high\" in the UK.\nHe added: \"We continue to top the list of places where people are willing to take, or have taken, a Covid vaccine.\"\nUnfortunately, even with three-quarters of adults having received at least one dose, there's still a way to go. \nThe first dose of the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of coronavirus in the UK. \nThat's the variant first identified in India - now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. \nThere may be a small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who don't get full protection. \nBut this is a large country and that's still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. \nIf this new strain of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. \nEvery person fully vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. \nBut we don't know exactly how infectious it is. That's the key job of the next few weeks - finding out whether the virus we'll be facing in the summer could cause a big third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. \nMeanwhile, speculation continues over whether the government will ease all remaining restrictions in England on 21 June.\nMr Hancock said the decision - which is due to be made a week prior to that date - will depend on how successfully Covid vaccines sever the link between cases and deaths.\nAsked whether mask wearing and work-from-home guidance may continue past June, he said there was nothing in the data to suggest the UK was \"definitively off track\".\nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the next 12 days \"are going to be really important to see what the virus is doing\". \n\"We've got a very large-scale surveillance infrastructure in place in terms of waste water surveillance and large-scale testing,\" he told ITV's Peston. \nOn the possibility of giving vaccines to children over the age of 12, he said it would need to be \"unbelievably safe\" and the government would be waiting for guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the regulator. \nScientists advising the government have offered various different perspectives over the last few days about the prospect of easing restrictions. \nOn Wednesday Sir John Bell, who sits on the government's vaccine taskforce, said the UK's \"numbers don't look too intimidating\" and he was \"encouraged\" by what he saw.\nBut on Tuesday, Prof Ravi Gupta, from the advisory committee Nervtag, said there were signs the UK was in the early stages of a third wave, and called for the ending of restrictions to be delayed.\nThe number of new cases reported daily continues to rise, with 4,330 infections reported on Wednesday. Another 12 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded - but the first day after a bank holiday weekend is typically higher than surrounding days because of delays in reporting deaths.\nThe proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales - as measured weekly by mentions on death certificates - is at its lowest level for more than eight months, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics."

      "text": "Etsy is buying Depop, a UK-based second-hand fashion app, in a bid to target younger Gen-Z shoppers.\nThe $1.62bn (\u00a31.14bn) deal was announced on Wednesday and is expected to go through later this year.\nEtsy boss Josh Silverman described Depop as \"the resale home for Gen-Z consumers\".\nAbout 90% of Depop's users are under the age of 26, with younger shoppers placing importance on shopping in a more sustainable way.\nThe app, which was founded in London in 2011, lets users buy and sell used clothes through its online marketplace.\nDepop combines its shopping element with Instagram-style direct messages, so buyers and sellers can negotiate on prices and postage. \nIt now counts about 30 million registered users in total across 150 countries.\nEtsy, however, tends to skew towards older customers, with craft goods and vintage items on offer from sellers.\nEtsy's chief executive Mr Silverman added in a statement: \"Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale.\"\nIt added that the deal would allow Depop to expand further, although it will still be based in London and run by its existing team.\nDepop chief executive Maria Raga said: \"We're on an incredible journey building Depop into a place where the next generation comes to explore unique fashion and be part of a community that's changing the way we shop.\n\"They come to Depop for the clothes, but stay for the culture.\"\nAfter the deal is completed, Etsy will be home to three brands - Etsy, Depop, and also Reverb, an online marketplace for new and used musical instruments.\nResale firms such as Depop, Ebay and Vinted have benefitted from consumers being stuck at home during lockdown, with sales and listings of items spiking.\nAccording to analytics firm GlobalData, that trend is set to continue with the resale clothing market set to reach $64bn in the next five years.\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said: \"Over the next ten years it will become larger still, fuelled by an interest in sustainability, a desire for uniqueness, and the rise of the participatory consumer who wants to trade as well as buy.\"\nHe pointed out that the market is, however, becoming more crowded with apps forced to fight for customers' attention. \nDepop has also faced questions in the past over the security of its app, as well as the sale of stolen goods, such as one crop top made out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "A police officer charged with murder said his \"fear was through the roof\" when he Tasered an ex-footballer.\nPC Benjamin Monk, 43, is on trial at Birmingham Crown Court charged with the murder of Dalian Atkinson in 2016.\nAs his defence begins, he told jurors he thought he and co-accused PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith \"were going to die\" when they responded to a callout to Mr Atkinson's father's home in Telford.\nThe former Aston Villa star died after the stand-off on 15 August that year.\nThe West Mercia Police officers were called to the address on Meadow Close at about 01:30 BST following reports from neighbours Mr Atkinson was acting strangely and claiming to be the Messiah. \nPC Monk told the court the former striker was erratic, unpredictable, terrifying and that he ignored his warnings to stop when the officer pointed his Taser.\nTwice PC Monk deployed his Taser unsuccessfully, telling jurors: \"My fear was going through the roof.\n\"It was the second time [the] device failed. I thought we were done for.\"\nAsked what he did next, he said: \"Ran for my life, we ran away,\" adding he had never done that before in his 14-year career.\n\"He [Mr Atkinson] was very, very scary,\" he said. \"And the device which I thought might work for me, hadn't worked and I was terrified.\"\nThe court previously heard how Mr Atkinson pursued the officers down the driveway before smashing a pane of glass in his father's front door.\nPC Monk said he and PC Bettley-Smith, with whom he was in a relationship at the time, \"had to protect the man inside the house\" and aimed his Taser at the footballer for the third time.\nOn the third Taser discharge, PC Monk overrode the system, holding down the trigger for 33 seconds - more than six times the standard deployment.\nThe officer, who had never previously fired the device, said he had no idea how long he fired his Taser for, but he felt \"big relief\" when Mr Atkinson fell to the ground.\nPC Monk said he thought the sportsman, who also played for Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday, was trying to get up, so he kicked him.\nThe court heard previously that PC Monk kicked Mr Atkinson in the head at least twice while he lay on the ground, with sufficient force to leave imprints of his bootlaces.\nBut the officer said in an interview at the time he believed he had kicked the 48-year-old \"in the shoulder\".\nHowever, he had told colleagues at the scene in the immediate aftermath, \"I had to kick him in the head\".\nAsked by his barrister, Patrick Gibbs QC, why there was a difference in his account, PC Monk replied: \"I think it was influenced by wishing things could have been different - wishful thinking.\"\nThe officer said: \"There wasn't an intention to kick him anywhere, it was an instinctive act, a desperate, instinctive act because this was the last thing I had.\n\"I believe, in my interview, I said my intention was to kick him in the shoulder but it's more realistic to say that it was instinctive.\"\nPC Monk stated he \"thought if he's going to get up, we were going to die.\"\nThe officer said the force he used to kick the former sportsman as he lay on the ground was \"about a four\" out of 10 on a sliding scale.\nHe also said he \"didn't want to hurt Mr Atkinson in any capacity\" and that was why he was \"confident my intention was not to kick him hard\".\nMr Atkinson died in hospital just over an hour after the confrontation. When he heard the news, PC Monk said he was \"devastated\".\nAsked if he felt his actions were reasonable that night, he said: \"In all the circumstances, with everything I faced, I am confident my actions were reasonable, they were necessary and I just did the best I could.\"\nPC Monk also denies an alternative manslaughter charge and his co-accused, PC Bettley-Smith, 31, denies assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "\"Work has got more stressful over the last year,\" says Claire Mullaly.\n\"There's a pressure to check emails, jump on video calls and to be on hand at all hours of the day, and it's become harder to draw a line between work and home life.\"\nClaire, an IT consultant from Northern Ireland, argues the situation facing her and millions of others working from home during the pandemic \"isn't sustainable\".\nAnd, with many of its members warning that their mental health is being compromised, the trade union Prospect is calling for the government to give employees a legally binding \"right to disconnect\".\nThis would ban bosses from \"routinely emailing or calling\" outside set working hours.\nAny emails sent at these times could also be automatically deleted to deter off-duty staff from continually checking their inbox.\n\"While digital technology has kept us safe during the pandemic, for millions of people, working from home has felt more like sleeping in the office, making it harder to fully switch off,\" says Prospect's deputy general secretary, Andrew Pakes.\nThe Office for National Statistics has found that 35.9% of the UK's employed population did at least some of their work from home last year.\nThis group - while saving time on commuting - did an average of six hours' unpaid overtime each week, it adds.\nThe right to disconnect has been law for four years in France, where companies are asked to set agreed \"specific hours\" for \"teleworkers\".\nIreland also brought in a code of practice last month, under which employers should add \"footers and pop-up messages to remind employees... that there is no requirement to reply to emails out of hours\".\nProspect, whose members include managers, civil servants, engineers and scientists, wants the UK government to set out similar protections in its Employment Bill, expected to be published later this year.\n\"Burning people out isn't good for workers or employers,\" says Claire. \"We've got to give people time to switch off and recharge.\"\nBank worker Omar says no-one he knows believes they can be as productive working from home as they can in the office, where they have access to big screens, technology and interacting with colleagues.\nAnd at home, he found, work takes over your life.\n\"You're on your laptop before breakfast,\" he says. \"When you're in the office there's the journey in, buying a coffee, chatting to a colleague and sitting down at your desk at 8.30 or 9am.\"\nRead more\nBut companies and lawyers have raised doubts over whether the right to disconnect is feasible at a time when many employees are themselves asking for flexible working.\nPeter Cheese, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says it would be \"very challenging\" to make Prospect's proposal work.\n\"The big question is how do we create good ways of working that are good for people's wellbeing and how you improve people's work-life balance,\" he adds.\nThe official advice across the UK currently is for people to work at home wherever possible.\nTo preserve wellbeing, the Mental Health Foundation recommends that bosses stay in daily contact with employees.\nHowever, it says they must \"respect the boundaries people have between work and home life\".\n\"We recognise this has been an exceptionally difficult year, and that the pandemic has had an impact on mental health,\" a Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson says.  \n\"We are wholeheartedly committed to improving and upholding workers' rights and this is why we will fulfil a [Conservative Party] manifesto commitment to consult on making flexible work the default.\"\nThe government's Flexible Working Taskforce is investigating how \"hybrid\" work - split between home and the office/formal workplace - will operate after the pandemic.\nThis includes looking at the right to disconnect."

      "text": "The UK has ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home.\nA junior minister, Baroness Sugg, has quit over the move, calling it \"fundamentally wrong\" at a time of \"unprecedented\" global crisis.\nBut Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was hard to \"justify\" the policy with the UK facing record borrowing.\nThe cut - to 0.5% of national income - will save about \u00a34bn a year.\nMr Sunak said this would be \"temporary\" and the 0.7% target would return when finances allowed.\nThe move has been criticised by some Conservatives, who point out that it was a key promise in the party's 2019 general election manifesto.\nBaroness Sugg, who was David Cameron's chief of staff when he was PM, has quit as minister for sustainable development, overseas territories and the Caribbean.\nIn a letter to Boris Johnson, she said it was \"fundamentally wrong\" to abandon the foreign aid promise, which \"should be kept in the tough times as well as the good\".\nHe responded by praising the minister's \"passion and commitment\" to her work and her \"efforts in support of girls' education in particular\".\nCurrently, the UK commits 0.7% of national income to overseas aid. \nIn 2019, it spent \u00a314.6bn ($19.4bn) compared with $34.6bn by the US and $23.8bn by Germany - according to figures from the OECD.\nBut if you look at overseas aid spending as a percentage of national income, the UK currently beats them and comes out top of the G7 group of the wealthiest nations.\nGermany trails closely behind on 0.6%, with France spending 0.44% and the US on 0.16%.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said that even after the UK drops to 0.5% next year it \"would remain the second-highest aid donor in the G7\".\nThat's right - Germany would take over the lead but France could soon take second place - as it wants to raise its aid contribution to 0.55% of national income in 2022.\nMr Sunak did say the government's \"intention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal situation allows\" but he gave no specific timeline.\nConservative MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence committee, told BBC News the foreign aid cut \"will come back and haunt us in the long term\".\nHe said it would reduce British influence, increase poverty and instability - and \"allow China and Russia to take advantage\" by moving quickly to fill the \"vacuum\".\nIn the Commons, Rishi Sunak said the government had to make \"tough\" choices, as he set out his Spending Review for the year ahead.\nHe added that 0.5% of national income would be spent on overseas aid in 2021 - the equivalent of \u00a310bn - and the UK would still be the second-highest aid donor in the G7 group of major economies.\nMr Cameron said the 0.7% promise said \"something great\" about the UK, adding: \"These were brilliant things that we were doing, and I think it's sad that we are standing back from that.\"\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, described Mr Sunak's decision as \"shameful and wrong\".\n\"I join others in urging MPs to reject it for the good of the poorest, and the UK's own reputation and interest,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nOxfam chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah was among dozens of charity bosses to criticise the decision.\nHe said: \"Cutting the UK's lifeline to the world's poorest communities in the midst of a global pandemic will lead to tens of thousands of otherwise preventable deaths.\"\nAnd Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of turning his back on the world's poorest, adding that it was \"in Britain's national interest to lay the foundations for economic growth across the world\".\nBut Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted: \"At last we have a Conservative chancellor that understands Conservative voters on foreign aid.\" \nAnd Conservative MP Philip Davies said people in the \"real world\" will back the cut.\n\"I suspect that the vast majority of the British public won't be asking why has he cut so much, they will probably be asking why are we still spending so much,\" he added.\nFormer Conservative Prime Ministers Sir John Major and his Labour successor Tony Blair were among those calling for the 0.7% target to be kept.\nIt could also face opposition from some Tory MPs, including former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, when the Commons votes on it."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be offered to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK, following updated advice from the UK's vaccine committee.\nAll over-18s across the UK can have two Covid vaccine doses, as can some vulnerable, high-risk children over 12.\nHealthy, low-risk children between 12 and 15 have only been offered a single dose - which should be delayed until 12 weeks after a coronavirus infection.\nThe Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says a second dose for those aged 16 and 17 is safe and effective 12 weeks after the first.\nThe JCVI has previously held back from recommending a second dose because of concerns over a very rare heart condition, called myocarditis, experienced by tiny numbers of young people - particularly boys - after the second dose.\nIt says it is now reassured by evidence from other countries that a 12-week gap between doses would lower that already very small risk.\nA decision on a second dose for 12-15s has not yet been made but could happen in the next few weeks.\nIn the meantime, all 12-17 year olds should wait 12 weeks after a Covid infection before having their first or second dose.\nNo vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nIf you're over 18, and want to book your first, second or booster dose, you can find out how here.\nNo. If you're under 40 or pregnant you'll be given Pfizer or Moderna.\nEvery woman who is pregnant (or planning to become pregnant) is encouraged to get two vaccine doses. Hospital figures show that 98% of pregnant women admitted to intensive care this year were not vaccinated.\nUnder-18s have so far been offered Pfizer. \nThe vaccines are very effective at protecting people against becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid-19. \nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests more than 90% protection against hospitalisation and death with all three vaccines.\nThe vaccines are less effective at stopping people becoming infected by the virus, developing mild symptoms or passing it on - but they do reduce the risk of that happening too.\nIf you've been double-jabbed, you are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nCovid vaccines aren't compulsory, but everyone is urged to get jabbed to protect themselves, their family, friends and wider society.\nChildren under 16 don't need parental consent to get jabbed, as long as they are believed to have \"enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment\". This is known as \"Gillick competence\". \nBeing fully vaccinated can make travelling to most other countries easier, and in many cases means you will not have to self-isolate either when you return to the UK. \nHowever, it's worth bearing in mind that under-16s are not eligible for their own digital NHS Covid Pass, which is now accepted widely as proof of vaccination. \nWhat's more, the single jab which most UK teenagers have so far received, is not recognised as full vaccination by some countries (including France), and more tests may be required.\nCheck your destination's rules on the Foreign Office website before you travel. \nMost are mild, completely normal and disappear after a few days. \nThey happen because the body's defences are reacting to the vaccine, and include:\nA very small number of people had a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so you should discuss any allergies you have before vaccination.\nThere's no evidence to suggest you should avoid alcohol altogether, but drinking in large quantities can suppress your immune system.\nSome women have experienced unusually heavy, painful or prolonged periods after being jabbed.\nThis may be because the vaccine prompts an increase in activity in the immune system, which also plays a role in the menstrual cycle. \nHowever, there's no evidence  the vaccine has any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nPregnant women are being urged to get the vaccine, to protect themselves and their babies.\nCoronavirus can cause serious illness in some women in later pregnancy, and possibly a slightly higher rate of stillbirth.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy or are breastfeeding, government guidance says you can still get vaccinated, \nA recent study suggests vaccination can help improve long Covid symptoms.\nResearchers think the vaccine could be pressing the body's reset button and helping it recover.

      "text": "A landlord accused of destroying history by renaming a pub that is more than 200 years old has actually restored its original name. \nThe pub, on Cardiff's High Street, originally opened as Blue Bell in 1813, but became the Goat Major in 1995.\nPrevious owners Brains did not plan to reopen it as lockdown eased but Croeso pubs bought it and returned it to its 208-year-old name.\nSome social media users had accused Croeso of a \"criminal\" name change.\nAfter also complaining that its owners were \"destroying Cardiff's history\", it was pointed out the Blue Bell was in fact its historical name, forcing the accusers to retract their statement.\nNick Newman, who has worked in hospitality in the city for 41 years and will manage the pub, said it was a \"storm in a Twitter cup\" and had been resolved quickly and politely.\nThe Blue Bell was renamed the Goat Major to mark its connection with the Welsh infantry regiment, The Royal Welsh, whose mascot is a goat that was sponsored by Brains brewery.\nMr Newman, 61, said changing the name was a difficult decision but ultimately seemed like the right thing to do - because the military connection would go down in history anyway whereas the Blue Bell name may not.\n\"We sat down and said, 'Do we keep it as the Goat Major or turn it back to Blue Bell?\n\"I found this out from veterans but Brains called it Goat Major because there used to have military tattoos in the castle, but they no longer take place, so that took away part of the reason for keeping the name.\n\"That's already got its place in history, so we thought it was probably right to take it back to Blue Bell.\"\nMr Newman was also responsible for bringing the Philharmonic pub back into use, which he said had become \"derelict and dilapidated\". The company also has Brew House and Retro.\n\"We like to take bits of Cardiff's heritage and restore them to former glory,\" he said.\n\"We felt our main focus with the pandemic was keeping the business going.\n\"People do joke about me being the grandfather of High Street and St Mary Street and we could pick any of [the pubs on those streets] and say, 'If you know what you're about, and we do, you'll be able to do it right'.\"\nMr Newman, who is also chairman of Cardiff Licensees Forum, said otherwise the reception to the name change has been \"really positive\", especially among the older generation who still remember the pub as the Blue Bell.\n\"They all said it's great to see the Blue Bell again.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The easing of lockdown restrictions has been paused for millions of people in Scotland - but rules are to be relaxed in Glasgow from Saturday.\nMost of the country had been due to drop down to level one in the five-tier system from next week.\nBut First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 13 council areas would stay in level two due to rising case rates.\nThey will be joined by Glasgow, which had been the only part of the country still in level three.\nMany areas in the north and south of the country will still move to level one as planned, with island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles in level zero.\nThe first minister said a \"slight slowing down\" of the easing of restrictions was needed while vaccination continues - but described it as \"a pause, not a step backwards\".\nGlasgow will enter level two on Saturday, allowing six people from three households to meet up indoors for the first time in many months.\nPubs and restaurants will be able to sell alcohol indoors, and the travel ban between Glasgow and other parts of the country will also be lifted.\nThirteen council areas, with a combined population of more than 2.3 million people, will stay in level two while local case numbers are high and vaccines are still being rolled out.\nThese areas - which all have case rates above 50 per 100,000 people - are: Edinburgh; Dundee; Stirling; Midlothian; East Dunbartonshire; Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire; Clackmannanshire; North and South Lanarkshire; and North, South and East Ayrshire.\nWith the addition of Glasgow, it means just under three million people will be subject to level two restrictions.\nMs Sturgeon said she knew it would be \"very disappointing\" for the people in these areas, but said: \"Taking a cautious approach now - while more people get fully vaccinated - gives us the best chance of staying on the right track overall.\"\nThe rest of mainland Scotland will be moving to level one on 5 June, which means eight people from three households can meet indoors and 12 people from 12 households can meet outdoors.\nSoft play centres and funfairs are allowed to reopen and 100 people are allowed to attend weddings or funerals.\nMost of Scotland's island communities, including Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles, will move from level one to level zero.\nThis will allow people to meet up in greater numbers, although Ms Sturgeon said people from the mainland should take a Covid-19 test before travelling there.\nThe first minister told MSPs that she was \"optimistic about our chances of much more normality over the summer and beyond\" as the vaccine programme continues, but said a careful approach was still needed due to new variants of the virus.\nShe said: \"I appreciate that today's decisions will feel like a mixed bag. That reflects the fact we are now in a transition phase.\n\"The vaccines make the outlook positive, but the new variant means the road ahead is still potentially bumpy - so caution is necessary.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"a more local approach\" was needed, arguing for \"targeted interventions to tackle local outbreaks instead of sweeping measures\".\nHe said: \"Half of the country will move forward while the rest will be stuck in limbo with no clear idea when the restrictions will ease.\"\nIt's no surprise that many parts of Scotland are being held in level two. There have been warnings from scientists across the UK that caution is required as case numbers go up, and it would be out of character for Nicola Sturgeon not to tread carefully.\nSome experts believe what we are seeing in Scotland is the start of a third wave. The question is, how big will it be?\nIt looks like vaccines are holding up against the new, more transmissible, Indian variant. \nThe proportion of people who test positive and go on to need hospital treatment appears to be far less than it was in the autumn of last year.  Scientists say it's a very good sign that the vaccine is breaking the link between cases and hospitalisations, but that efforts should be stepped up to maximise protection by getting people to come forward for a first or second jag.   \nThere is also a nervousness that too big an increase in Covid patients in hospital could stall any progress the NHS is making on catching up on the backlog of routine work. \nThat is why the decision to slow down the easing of restrictions. \nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the news would be welcome in Glasgow, but a \"bitter blow\" to people in parts of Scotland which will now not be moving down a level.\nHe said: \"It is paramount that we now design proper protocols for what happen in current and future hotspot areas learning from the Glasgow experience.\"\nScottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater called for \"urgent consideration\" to maintaining a ban on evictions as long as restrictions are in place - something Ms Sturgeon said she would keep under review.\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he was \"deeply concerned about the lack of services for adults with special needs\".\nMs Sturgeon said more key services could now get back to normal, and that she was \"trying to manage these issues as carefully and sensitively as we can\"."

      "title": "Covid: 75% of UK adults vaccinated, and a school catch-up funding row",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nWe start with some good news - 75% of UK adults have received their first coronavirus vaccination and 49.5% have had both doses, government figures show. The milestone was reached as the UK hosted the Global Vaccine Confidence Summit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the summit the lack of queue-jumping was key to the success of the vaccine rollout. He also credited celebrities who announced when they'd had the jab for \"normalising the acceptance of the vaccine.\" Mr Hancock also said deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam had become a household name due to his \"straight-talking approach\" and people now had T-shirts and mugs with his face on.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said there is still \"nothing in the data\" to suggest the lifting of all of England's legal lockdown restrictions could not go ahead on 21 June. But he said people have to be \"cautious\" while the data is \"still ambiguous\". He said: \"I'm sorry that's frustrating for people, I know that people want a clear answer about the way ahead for 21 June but at the moment we have just got to wait a little bit longer.\" A final decision on whether restrictions will be relaxed will be reached on 14 June - here's a reminder of what could change.\nMeanwhile, a member of the government's vaccine taskforce, Sir John Bell, said the UK's coronavirus data looked \"encouraging\". The number of weekly coronavirus deaths are at their lowest since September. A total of 115 of the 11,214 deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. And Tuesday saw no UK Covid deaths announced for the first time since the pandemic began. A further 12 were reported today. But there is concern over a rise in cases linked to the variant first identified in India, now known as Delta. The UK reported 4,330 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, marking the eighth day in a row the total was more than 3,000. But hospital admissions remain below 1,000 - compared to nearly 40,000 during January's peak. \nThe prime minister has promised schools in England more money after catch-up funding plans were labelled a \"damp squib\". The plan set out an extra \u00a31.4bn over three years to deliver what Boris Johnson called the \"biggest tutoring programme in the world\". It breaks down to \u00a350 extra per pupil per year. The Education Policy Institute (EPI) had calculated \u00a313.5bn was needed to make up for learning lost during the pandemic. The education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, has resigned over the row, saying the plan \"falls far short of what is needed\".\nIn other news, if you've found yourself reading more than usual in lockdown you're not the only one. Bloomsbury Publishing - famous for the Harry Potter series - saw sales rise 14% to \u00a3185m, while profits were up by more than one-fifth to \u00a319.2m in the year to the end of February. Chief executive Nigel Newton told the BBC: \"The popularity of reading has been a ray of sunshine in an otherwise very dark year.\" He said that people had \"rediscovered the joy of reading\" and would \"cling on to that even as other ways of spending their time re-emerge\".

      "text": "The Tokyo Olympic Games are under way, with thousands of athletes set to compete.\nOrganisers say the event can be held safely, despite calls for it to be cancelled because of Covid.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympic Games take place between 23 July and 8 August. \nThe Paralympic Games are due to run between 24 August and 5 September. \nThe Games were postponed last year because of Covid. \nThe Olympics will feature 33 sports at 339 events across 42 venues. The Paralympics will feature 22 sports at 539 events across 21 venues.\nMost events are in the Greater Tokyo area, although some football games and the marathon will take place in the northern city of Sapporo.\nJapan has had relatively low case numbers, but a new wave of infections began in April.\nAs of 21 July, there were 848,222 confirmed cases and 15,062 deaths (compared with 5.5 million cases and 128,800 deaths in the UK).\nJapan only began vaccinating in February and only 22% of its population of about 126 million is fully vaccinated.\nIn Tokyo and Osaka, the two cities hit hardest by the recent surge, authorities hope over-65s will be fully vaccinated by the end of July. \nEntry to Japan by foreigners from 159 countries - including the UK - is currently banned. \nInternational athletes and support staff are being tested every day.\nAthletes don't have to be vaccinated, though International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials expect around 80% will be.\nMore than 90 people associated with the Games have tested positive so far, including British athlete Amber Hill who has withdrawn from the women's skeet competition.\nAll spectators were banned after a state of emergency was declared in Tokyo on 8 July. It will stay in place until 22 August.\nA decision about whether Japanese spectators will be able to attend the Paralympics has not yet been made.\nTokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said she was \"sorry to those who purchased tickets\".\nThe contract between the IOC and the host city Tokyo suggests only the IOC can cancel the event.\nThe IOC is thought to make around 70% of its money from broadcast rights, and 18% from sponsorship.\nIOC president Thomas Bach said the thought of rescheduling the competition \"caused sleepless nights\". He insisted the Games must go ahead \"to give hope\" for the future.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also backed the competition, arguing it could show what can be done with the correct Covid safeguards.\nBut the head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee Toshiro Muto has not ruled out cancelling the Olympic Games even at this late stage.  He said he would keep an eye on infection numbers and hold \"discussions\" if necessary.\nIf the Tokyo organisers were to cancel the contract, the risks and losses would probably fall on the Japanese side. \nThe budget for Tokyo 2020 was set at $12.6bn (\u00a38.9bn), although it's been reported the actual cost may be double that. \nSeveral towns set to host athletes reportedly pulled out earlier in the year because of fears about Covid and extra pressure on the healthcare system.\nIn May, a Japanese doctors' union said it was \"impossible\" to hold the Games given the pandemic. \nA poll in May in the leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper suggested more than 80% of the population want them cancelled or postponed.\nA number of bodies have expressed concern. \nThe World Players Association, representing 85,000 athletes in over 60 countries, said the IOC must do more to ensure athletes' safety - with stricter physical distancing and more rigorous testing. \nJapanese athletes have largely kept a low profile, but the country's biggest sports star, tennis champion Naomi Osaka, previously said there should be a debate about whether the Games should go ahead.

      "text": "The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling.\nLockdowns are gradually being eased as the summer tourist season gets under way, and there are plans for an EU-wide digital vaccination certificate to be in place by 1 July.\nNationwide curfew ended on 20 June, 10 days earlier than planned. Face masks are no longer required outdoors. \nRestaurants, cafes and bars can serve customers indoors, with 50% capacity and up to six people per table.\nStanding concerts will resume on 30 June and nightclubs on 9 July (with 75% capacity). People attending will need a health pass which shows either full vaccination, a negative test within the previous 72 hours, or else a previous coronavirus infection.\nRestaurants, bars, beer gardens, museums, hotels and concert halls have reopened.\nMedical grade masks are compulsory in shops and on public transport.\nLocal authorities can impose stricter rules in high infection rate areas. \nFrom 30 June, working from home will no longer be compulsory.\nOn 21 June, Italy's curfew was scrapped and the whole country, except for the northwest region of Valle d'Aosta, became \"white zone\" - the country's lowest-risk category.\nAmong the measures still in place are social distancing (1m) and the wearing of masks indoors (and in crowded outdoor places), and a ban on house parties and large gathering. \nNightclubs and discos are also closed. \nAll indoor businesses, with the exception of nightclubs, are open. \nThe government introduced a \"corona pass\" in April, the first to do so in Europe. \nThis shows - either on a phone or on paper - that you have been vaccinated, previously infected or that you have had a negative test within 72 hours. \nPeople need to show it for entry to cinemas, museums, hairdressers or indoor dining.\nThe Greek government is welcoming tourists from many countries, if they are fully vaccinated or can provide a negative coronavirus test.  \nFace coverings must be worn in all public places and there is a curfew from 01:30-05:00, but bars, restaurants, museums and archaeological sites are all open.\nCinemas, theatres, museums and restaurants are open at 50% capacity. From 26 June, this increases to 75%. \nNightclubs and discos will also be allowed to reopen, with a limit of 150 people.\nFace coverings must be worn in enclosed spaces and 1.5m social distancing observed.\nShops, bars, restaurants and museums are open, although face coverings remain compulsory in most public places. \nNightclubs can now reopen in parts of Spain with low infection rates. \nIn Barcelona, they are restricted to 50% of capacity and can stay open until 03:30 - dancers have to wear masks.\nSpain began welcoming vaccinated tourists from 7 June. Most European travellers still have to present a negative Covid test on arrival.\nShops, cinemas, gyms, cafes and restaurants are open, with restrictions. Households can invite up to four people inside.\nFrom 1 July, working from home will no longer be mandatory, if the situation continues to improve. \nCultural performances, shows and sports competitions can also go ahead, with limited numbers, and more people will be allowed at weddings and other ceremonies and parties. \nPortugal has lifted many of its restrictions but face coverings must still be worn in indoor public spaces and some outdoor settings.\nBars and nightclubs remain closed, and it's illegal to drink alcohol outdoors in public places, except for pavement caf\u00e9s and restaurants. \nAlcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 unless it is with a meal.\nRestaurants, cafes and cultural venues have to close at 01:00 and have capacity limits. \nA weekend travel ban is in force in the Lisbon area, starting at 15:00 on Friday, with residents only allowed to leave for essential journeys. \nIn Lisbon and in Albufeira (Algarve), cafes, restaurants and non-essential shops have to close by 15:30 at the weekend and 22:30 on weekdays. \nRestaurants, cafes, museums and historic buildings have reopened with capacity limits. \nFrom 26 June, a number of restrictions are being lifted. \nAlcohol can be sold after 22:00, and nightclubs can open, with an entry pass system. \nEvents held in public venues such as cinemas, conference centres and concert halls will be allowed, subject to social distancing. \nMasks will no longer be compulsory except on public transport, airports and in secondary schools.\nOutdoor services in restaurants and bars returned in June. Theme parks, funfairs, cinemas and theatres, gyms and swimming pools, have reopened as well.\nFrom 5 July, restaurants and bars will be able to serve customers indoors. Weddings and other indoor events for up to 50 people will be permitted and the numbers at outdoor organised events will increase. \nSince June, pubs have been able to stay open until 22:30 and more people are now allowed at sports events, outdoor concerts, cinemas and markets.\nOn 1 July, limits on private gatherings will be raised, and the recommendation to interact with a small circle of people removed.\nFurther easing is planned on 15 July and in September.

      "text": "Holby City, the long-running BBC medical drama, is to end after 23 years, producers have confirmed.\nThe series, created by Tony McHale and Mal Young, first aired in 1999 as a spin-off from another show, Casualty.\nThe BBC announced on Wednesday that the drama will broadcast its final series in March 2022.\nThe corporation said it was \"incredibly proud\" of the show but said it \"had to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities\".\nAround 250 people who work on the show - including actors, camera operators, engineers and hair and make-up professionals - will be affected by the decision.\nHolby City won a Bafta for best continuing drama in 2008 and still regularly attracts more than 3 million viewers.\n\"We are incredibly proud of Holby City but it's with great sadness that we are announcing that after 23 years, the show will end on screen in March of next year,\" the BBC said in a statement.\n\"We sometimes have to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities and as part of the BBC's commitment to make more programmes across the UK, we have taken the difficult decision to bring the show to a close in order to reshape the BBC's drama slate to better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country.\"\nIt added: \"We would like to take this opportunity to thank the amazing team at BBC Studios and all the cast and crew who have been involved in the show since 1999.\n\"Holby has been a stalwart with audiences, delighting millions of viewers each week and winning hundreds of awards with a compelling mix of cutting edge medical stories and explosive personal stories.\n\"We look forward to working with the team over the coming months to ensure that when it ends, Holby goes out on a high.\"\nBoth Holby City, and Casualty are based in the fictional county of Wyvern, South West England.\nBut the bulk of the on-set filming for Holby City takes place at the BBC's Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, as well as shots from around Bristol.\nIn March, the BBC announced its plan to move some of its key departments and staff around the country in order to make the corporation more reflective of the UK as a whole.\n\"Our mission must be to deliver for the whole of the UK and ensure every household gets value from the BBC,\" said director general Tim Davie.\n\"These plans will get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment, and develop and nurture new talent.\"\nRacking up more than 1,000 episodes over 23 series, Holby City has also proved to be a fertile breeding ground for some top acting talent down the years.\nKilling Eve star Jodie Comer received one of her first acting jobs on the programme, as did fellow Bafta-winner and Black Panther actress Letitia Wright, Peaky Blinders actor Joe Cole and Lee Ryan from the boyband Blue.\nAlready-established stars such as Adrian Edmondson and Patsy Kensit were also given parts, while the likes of Maureen Lipman, chat show host Paul O'Grady and comedian Romesh Ranganathan have also appeared as guests.\nThe show has held its place in the BBC One schedule on a Tuesday night for many years, tackling many topical issues along the way.\nOne of its most memorable storylines involved the separation of the conjoined Tan twins, in 2008. The surgery was completed by the show's longest-serving character Dr Ric Griffin, played by Hugh Quarshie.\nTwo years earlier, it showed Professor Elliot Hope's wife Gina travelling to Switzerland to end her life after struggling with motor neurone disease.\nSome of the hospital's fictional staff have themselves also faced health issues. In 2014 young junior doctor Zosia March was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, after suffering a breakdown following her mother's death. Dr Arthur Digby was diagnosed with melanoma two years later.\nThe hospital came under siege during a shooting spree in a 2017 episode.\nThe following year, a special show entitled The Anniversary Waltz helped to mark the 70th anniversary of the National Health Service. It saw characters explaining what the NHS means to them, as they attempted to get an outbreak of norovirus under control.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Details of celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee next June have been revealed by Buckingham Palace. \nThere will be a four-day Bank Holiday weekend from Thursday, 2 June to Sunday, 5 June, with events including a pageant with 5,000 performers.\nA live concert at Buckingham Palace, called the Platinum Party at the Palace, will feature \"the world's biggest entertainment stars\". \nAnd the Queen will head to the Derby, at Epsom Downs, with her family.  \nThe events will mark the Queen's 70-year reign, a milestone she will have reached on 6 February next year - becoming the first British Monarch to do so.  \nAs with the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, the first week in June has been chosen for the celebratory weekend, with the summer offering a better chance of good weather than February.\nThe Queen will be 96 at the time of the Platinum Jubilee events, taking place exactly a year from now.  \nTo create the four-day weekend, the late May Spring Bank Holiday that year will be moved to 2 June and an additional Bank Holiday on 3 June created.\nThe first day of the long weekend, the Thursday, will see Trooping the Colour held in full for the first time since the pandemic. There will be more than 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians taking part. \nAlso that day, Platinum Jubilee beacons will be lit across the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories. For the first time, the capital cities of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons. \nOn the second day of the Bank Holiday weekend a Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen's reign will be held at St Paul's Cathedral. \nOn the Saturday, the Queen will be joined by members of the Royal Family at the Derby, held at Epsom Downs. The live concert at the palace will take place that evening. \nPerformers have yet to be named, but it is billed as bringing together some of the world's biggest stars to celebrate the most significant and joyous moments from the Queen's seven-decade reign.\nThe Sunday will see communities take part in the Big Jubilee Lunch, with street parties held across the UK. That day's events will also include the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will feature 5,000 people from the UK and the Commonwealth performing around the area of Buckingham Palace. It will include street arts, theatre, music, circus, carnival and costume, the Palace said. \nThere will also be year-long Platinum Jubilee celebrations throughout the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and around the world. \nAnd throughout the year, the Queen and other members of the Royal Family will travel around the country taking part in engagements to mark the occasion - but the focal point will be the special June weekend.\nThe Queen is expected to attend all of the events herself - other than the Big Jubilee Lunch. \nBBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said: \"There has been some slowing down for several years, but she is still very engaged. \n\"Certainly she and the Palace will be hoping this will be an opportunity for people across the United Kingdom to show their continued commitment to, and regard and affection for, this particular monarch.\"\nAs for the Queen, she is \"forward-looking\" and will see it as an opportunity for herself, her family and the wider population \"to have a bit of a celebration\", he added - especially after what has been a difficult year for her family, with the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. \nNews of the planned events came as gun salutes were fired across London on Wednesday to mark the 68th anniversary of the Queen's coronation, when she was 27. \nThe coronation, at Westminster Abbey, took place 16 months after she acceded to the throne upon the death of her father, King George VI, to allow for a period of mourning and for the necessary preparations to take place. \n2 June 1953 - The Queen's coronation\n14 November 1973 - The wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips\n7 June 1977\u00a0- The Queen's Silver Jubilee\n29 July 1981 - The wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer\n3 June 2002 - The Queen's Golden Jubilee\n29 April 2011 - The wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton\n5 June 2012 - The Queen's Diamond Jubilee "

      "text": "Petrol prices have climbed to their highest level in two years, according to the RAC.\nRetailers may be charging more to make up for lower fuel sales during the pandemic, it said.\nPump prices fell in May 2020 to a low of 106p as oil prices plummeted, but motorists had to abide by travel restrictions.\nThe average cost of a litre has since soared to 129.27p, the highest level since August 2019.\nThe cost of a litre of unleaded is now more than 22p more expensive than a year ago - the biggest 12-month increase seen for 11 years.\n\"After seven consecutive months of rising prices drivers will be wondering if the increases are ever going to end,\" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.\nHe said motorists have faced the biggest petrol price rise in any 12-month period since May 2010 when unleaded rocketed from 99p a year earlier to 121p.\nUnleaded petrol has climbed 2p in the last month and 15p since November, since when prices have climbed every month.\nThat has left motorists paying \u00a38 more for a full tank of petrol than seven months ago.\nDiesel prices are climbing slightly less rapidly, up just less than 20p a litre over the last 12 months.\n\"Looking at the wholesale price of both fuels, in normal circumstances unleaded definitely shouldn't be continuing to rise with the numbers actually pointing to the potential for a 2p reduction,\" said Mr Williams.\nHe added that diesel is currently 4p too expensive \"which suggests retailers are using the saving in the wholesale price to help make up for lower fuel sales over the last year\".\nThe future of fuel prices is hard to predict more than a few weeks in advance and even more so now as the pandemic appears to have altered the dynamics of fuel retailing, he said. \nSupermarkets have an even greater share of the market, according to the RAC.\nBuying fuel at a forecourt run by one of the four major supermarket chains will currently save drivers around 4p a litre with the average price of petrol standing at 124.83p and diesel 127.36p.\n\"We urge retailers not to take advantage of drivers and fairly reflect what's happening with wholesale prices on the country's forecourts,\" he said.\nLuke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said: \"Oil prices rising back above 70 US dollars a barrel casts a shadow over staycation travel, with petrol prices at their highest for 20 months.\n\"The speed of the price rises at a time when drivers are beginning to travel much longer distances is a post-lockdown shock for many.\""

      "text": "A cluster of the Indian variant of Covid-19 is \"very serious\" and could affect the easing of restrictions in Wales, the health minister has said. \nEluned Morgan is \"very concerned\" the cluster in Conwy county is heading towards community transmission.\nThere are now 35 cases of the variant - renamed the Delta variant by the World Health Organization - in Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay. \nPeople have been urged to get tested, even if they do not have symptoms.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board has asked those without any Covid symptoms to get a lateral flow test at a mobile unit at Ysgol Awel y Mynydd in Llandudno Junction.\nThose in the area who do have symptoms have been asked to attend Conwy Business Centre for a more accurate PCR test.\nConwy county now has the second highest Covid rate in Wales.\nUpdated figures on the spread of the Delta variant are expected to be published by Public Health Wales later this week.\nThe UK government has said up to three-quarters of new cases in England could be of the variant, which has been renamed Delta by the World Health Organization.\nBaroness Morgan said the situation in Llandudno could affect further easing of restrictions across Wales.\n\"This is becoming very serious, we need to make sure that we try and nip this in the bud in that particular area and obviously all of this will play into how we assess the situation on Friday,\" she said.\n\"I don't think we'd define it quite yet as community transmission, but it's on its way to becoming that and that's why we really need people in the area to co-operate with us\u2026 to make sure that we can try and suppress this particular variant.\n\"The last thing we want to see is this spreading across the whole of Wales,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nShe said the 35 cases of the Delta variant had been identified through the Test, Trace, Protect scheme, which she said had been a \"phenomenal success\" throughout the pandemic and was being extended until March. \n\"We do know where those 35 people are and we are tracing their contacts,\" she said.\n\"It's been a highly successful programme so far. It's one of the key weapons in our arsenal in our efforts to curb the spread of Covid.\"\nAn additional \u00a332m will go towards the scheme, which has reached 99.7% of all positive cases eligible for follow up since it was introduced last June, the Welsh government said. \nHelen Alefounder, a GP in Conwy, said the potential for social mixing during half term was \"slightly worrying\".\n\"What's reassuring is we've isolated these cases, we know where they are and we can make sure that those patients are isolated and [we can] try and prevent the spread of the virus any further,\" she said.\n\"But it is half term... we've got a lot of visitors in Wales and we just need to make sure we're maintaining our social distancing and keeping to the rules because otherwise there will be an increase in cases. We don't want to go back to where we were a few months ago. \n\"It's really important for everyone to remember that this is still very real, the virus is still out there but we can prevent this. We can stop the cases from increasing,\" she said.\nConwy's Covid case rate is currently the 163rd highest in the UK.\nFor context, where we have had clusters in recent weeks - Bridgend, Newport and Monmouthshire - these have all eased off now and they never got beyond 30 cases per 100,000. \nAll, including Conwy, according to the most recent surveillance, have had raised numbers of under-25s; the Bridgend and Monmouthshire clusters were linked to schools in Porthcawl and Abergavenny.\nConwy breaks down into 15 communities. Three of these are among the 23 across Wales which have shown any positive test numbers greater than two in the past week. \nThe other 12 local areas are among the 94% in Wales with fewer than two cases in the last seven days.\nThe lag in test results being published means it will be a few more days before the Conwy cluster starts to show up properly in the figures. The county's case rate stands at just under 20 but it has been below the 50 cases per 100,000 threshold for two months. \nDuring the second wave in January, Conwy reached 221 cases per 100,000. That is the third lowest peak of any local authority area of Wales, after Anglesey and Gwynedd."

      "tags": "Brain cancer,NHS Wales,United States,Cancer,Oklahoma",
      "text": "The mum of a girl being treated for a brain tumour in the US is \"so scared of losing her, it's incomprehensible\".\nFreya Bevan is undergoing a second round of treatment for cancer that returned last year after six years. \nThe eight-year-old was first diagnosed with a rare form of the disease before Freya, from Neath in Neath Port Talbot, reached the age of two.\nWith celebrity support, a 2015 campaign raised \u00a3110,000 for her to undergo proton beam therapy in the US. \nBut the cancer is back and Freya's family are trying once again to \"give her the chance of life\", this time with a \u00a3200,000 fundraising drive.\nHer mum Kath was \"floored\" at being told the disease had returned. \n\"I was crushed,\" the 48-year-old said. \n\"It was just awful, I thought I just can't go through with this again. \n\"For some reason it felt worse than last time because we knew what was ahead.\"\nHaving done research Mrs Bevan knew a relapse was \"not great.\" \n\"To go through it once is bad enough, but for a little girl to go through it again a second time, she is so much older and aware this time,\" she said.\n\"I knew we had a rocky road in front of us. \n\"You're just numb. You're just completely numb. It's an awful feeling. And it's not just me. \n\"It's the whole family. Everyone was in shock.\"\nFreya was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in May 2014, at 22-months old. \nShe underwent two major brain surgery operations, chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. \nAnd in February 2015, she travelled with her family for the first time to Oklahoma for the proton beam therapy.\nThey returned to Wales in May that year and Freya began rebuilding her life. \nLast October however, a routine scan showed a tumour had returned. \nFreya had to then undergo a nine-hour operation on 31 December to remove it - the experience made worse by the fact it was the festive season..\n\"We tried to make Christmas as best as we could but we had that lurking over our head,\" Mrs Bevan said.\n\"It was a sad time.\" \nIt was then decided the family would return to the US for more proton beam therapy, which they could partly pay for with funds left over in 2015. \nThey arranged for Freya to be treated by Dr Andrew Chang, who had treated her before.\nAnd the family presumed things would go as smoothly as last time. \nBut it was \"completely different\". Freya was \"poorly from the start.\"\n\"The tumour had grown back already,\" Mrs Bevan said.\nHad this been known before they left, Freya may not have been allowed to fly, she confirmed. \nDespite not knowing what would happen, the family decided to press on with treatment.\n\"It took a massive toll on her little body,\" she said. \n\"It was quite harsh, there was a lot more radiation than before.\"\nAfter 30 sessions Freya \"just wanted it to finish.\" \nNow medical costs are mounting. \nNo initial fundraising was done as the trip was budgeted for.\nBut with things not going as planned there have been unexpected costs for things like MRI scans and general anaesthetics.\nIn the US a single MRI scan, Kath said, can cost as much as \u00a310,000. Freya has already had three.\n\"The bills are stacking up, and on top of the worry of getting Freya well, we have the worry of wondering how we are going to pay for all of this,\" Mrs Bevan said. \n\"Hence the fundraising is still going on and we are desperately trying to get more.\"\nIt was \"sad it has to come down to money.\" \n\"This little girl has been fighting to live since she was 20 months old and everyone can see she deserves this chance of life again,\" Freya's mum said. \nWith Freya's condition is on her her mind every day, she \"can't even think about\" losing her. \n\"She's a superhero in my eyes,\" she said. \n\"Some people have always wished to see their superhero but we see ours everyday.\n\"I feel so privileged to be her mum because she has shown me what real strength is.\" \nThe plan is to be home for Freya's ninth birthday in August. \n\"That's all she is talking about,\" Mrs Bevan said.\n\"She is so excited for her ninth birthday.\""

      "text": "The boss of Wetherspoons has denied claims his pubs are facing a staff shortage caused by Brexit.\nIt comes after Tim Martin was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying he favoured a more \"liberal\" visa scheme for EU workers to tackle shortfalls.\nMr Martin, a vocal Brexit supporter, told the BBC he had always favoured an Australian style system which treated near neighbours preferentially. \nThere was \"no recruitment issue\" other than in small coastal towns, he added. \nMany hospitality businesses have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, and firms are reportedly now struggling to recruit as they reopen. \nAccording to trade group UK Hospitality, Brexit has added to the problem, as more EU workers return to their home countries.\nAccording to the Telegraph, Mr Martin said a more flexible visa system for EU workers could help ease the pressure on firms. \n\"The UK has a low birth rate. A reasonably liberal immigration system controlled by those we have elected, as distinct from the EU system, would be a plus for the economy and the country,\" he told the paper. \n\"America, Australia and Singapore have benefited for many decades from this approach. Immigration combined with democracy works.\"\nHowever, Mr Martin later told the BBC the comment has been taken out of context. \nHe added that Wetherspoons was not struggling to recruit, and in some towns, such as Northallerton, jobs at its pubs were oversubscribed.\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics in April suggest that more than one in 10 UK hospitality workers left the industry in the last year.\nJames Reed, chief executive of the Reed employment agency, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the firm was advertising 275,000 new jobs in the sector in May.  \n\"When we added them up we had more jobs in May than in any month since February 2008,\" he said.\nHotel chain Best Western said it could not open some of its venues at full capacity due to staffing shortages.\nBoss Rob Paterson told the BBC: \"One hotel didn't have the cleaning staff to be able to sell all of their rooms.\n\"It's becoming restrictive on trade, at a time when we're investing so much on meeting safety precautions and needing more staff to do that.\" \nHe said uncertainty and a fear of being repeatedly furloughed had driven some employees away.\n\"They don't want to be in a hospitality industry that's shutting down and opening up and their jobs are always at risk. It's not just about pay conditions,\" said Mr Paterson.\nUK Hospitality has urged the government to encourage UK-based workers to join the sector.\nIt is also asking the government to renew its list of shortage occupations and consider a visa scheme for workers who would not qualify under the points-based system.\nOver the past 12 months Wetherspoons, which has 871 pubs, has reduced the number of staff by about 6,000 to almost 38,000."

      "tags": "Bolton,Bedford,Coronavirus vaccines,Croydon,Hillingdon,Blackburn,India,Hounslow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The majority of new coronavirus cases in the UK are the so-called Indian variant - named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization.\nThis version - or mutation - was first spotted in India last October.\nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter.\nThere have been almost 18,000 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in England, just under 3,000 in Scotland, 189 in Wales and 37 in Northern Ireland. \nThe latest Public Health England figures up to 2 June showed the worst-hit areas were:\nHowever, just because it's the most common strain doesn't always mean there's lots of it about. \nIn West Lancashire and East Hertfordshire, for example, in the two weeks to 29 May the variant accounted for 100% of the cases analysed for variants. But this amounted to only nine individual infections each.\nNot all cases are analysed and a higher proportion are in areas with lots of the Delta variant, potentially skewing the figures. \nBut random swabbing carried out by the Office for National Statistics, which is not skewed in this way, also found a growing proportion of cases looked like they were the Delta variant. \nIt does appear to spread more easily than the Kent variant (B.1.1.7). \nTransmission rates for the Indian strain have been put at anywhere between 30 and 100% higher than for the Kent or Alpha variant. \nRoughly 12% of contacts of people with the Indian variant went on to develop coronavirus, compared with 8% of those who had the so-called Kent variant, according to Public Health England analysis - suggesting it is roughly 50% more transmissible. \nBut some of that could be the behaviour of humans, rather than the virus itself. \nWhen a variant spreads faster than others, it could be driven by the strain being more infectious, by differences in how close people get, or by different vaccination rates. \nFor instance, it's been pointed out some of the worst-affected areas have very low proportions of residents working from home.\nDespite fears over the Indian variant, most of the UK went ahead with easing restrictions on 17 May.\nHowever, the government has issued new guidance for people in eight areas of England with high numbers of cases\nPeople have been advised to minimise travelling in and out of Kirklees, Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nIn addition, residents have been advised - wherever possible - to meet people outside, maintain social distancing of 2m (6ft) from people not in their household and work from home if they can. \nIt is not clear whether the next stage of easing in England will happen on 21 June, as was set out in the government's roadmap. \nThe prime minister and health secretary have indicated they will wait for another week's data before making a decision.\nMany countries already have bans on people from the UK and elsewhere entering. \nFrance has brought a ban on non-essential travel from the UK back into force in direct response to the spread of the India variant.

      "tags": "Pollution,Water pollution,Ocean pollution,Shipping industry,Environment,Sri Lanka",
      "text": "A chemical-laden cargo ship is sinking off the coast of Sri Lanka, sparking fears of an environmental disaster. \nThe Singapore-registered X-Press Pearl had been on fire for almost two weeks before the blaze was put out this week. \nHundreds of tonnes of oil from fuel tanks could leak into the sea, devastating nearby marine life. \nThe Sri Lankan and Indian navies had worked jointly over the past days in an attempt to put out the fire and prevent the ship from breaking up and sinking. \nBut rough seas and monsoonal winds hampered the operation, just outside the port of Colombo.\nOn Wednesday, salvage experts tried to tow the wreck into deeper water to minimise the pollution risk to the coastline. But the back section hit the seabed and the operation was abandoned.\nThe ship's operators, X-Press Feeders, said on Thursday that the \"aft portion is sitting on the seabed at a depth of about 21m (69ft), and the forward section is settling down slowly\".\nThe Sri Lankan navy said the bow of the ship was still above the waterline.\n\"Even if the bow also hits the sea bed, still there will be a section of the upper deck and bridge sticking out of the water,\" spokesman Indika de Silva told AFP news agency.\n\"There is no oil leak from the ship yet, but arrangements are in place to deal with a possible spill which is the worst-case scenario,\" he added.\nSri Lanka's marine protection agency said it was preparing booms, oil dispersants, booms and skimmers.\nEnvironmentalist Dr Ajantha Perera told the BBC that the sinking posed \"the worst environmental scenario\".\n\"With all the dangerous goods, the nitric acid and all these other things, and the oil in the ship, if it's sinking it will basically destroy the whole bottom of the sea,\" she said.\nThe coastal stretch near the city of Negombo - home to some of the country's most pristine beaches - has already seen oil and debris pollution for days. \nOn Wednesday, the fisheries ministry said emergency measures were in place to protect the Negombo lagoon and surrounding areas and all fishing from Panadura to Negombo had been suspended.\nJoshua Anthony, head of the regional fishing union, warned that the sinking could be \"a death blow\" for the industry.\n\"We can't go to the sea, which means we can't make a living,\" he said.\nSri Lankan officials believe the fire was caused by a nitric acid leak which the crew had been aware of since 11 May. The ship was carrying 25 tonnes of the highly corrosive acid, which can be used in the manufacture of fertilisers and explosives.\nThe ship's owners confirmed the crew had been aware of the leak, but said they were denied permission by both Qatar and India to leave the ship there before the fire broke out.\nThe fact that Sri Lanka allowed the vessel to enter its waters after it was rejected by two other nations has led to widespread public anger. \nOfficials have lodged a police complaint against the captain of the ship, who was rescued along with other crew members last week. \nSri Lanka police on Tuesday said they questioned the captain and the engineer of the ship for more than 14 hours.\nA court has issued an order preventing the captain, chief engineer and the additional engineer from leaving the country.\nThe 186m-long (610ft) vessel left the Indian port of Hazira on 15 May carrying 1,486 containers. As well as the nitric acid, the cargo included several other chemicals and cosmetics."

      "text": "Donald Trump's communications platform has been permanently shut down, his spokesperson told CNBC. \n\"It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on,\" senior aide Jason Miller said. \nThe platform, titled From the Desk of Donald J Trump, launched last month and served as a way for the former president to publish his own content including press releases and videos. \nMr Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter after the Capitol Hill Riots.\nFrom the Desk of Donald J Trump had a section on the former president's official website, but it has now been removed. Mr Miller confirmed via Twitter that it is a precursor to Mr Trump's return to social media, although it is unclear when or how. \nThe website - which was often referred to as a blog - had a rolling feed of Mr Trump's various posts and gave visitors the option to \"like\" the post and share it to Facebook and Twitter.\nThe link to the website now directs visitors to a page encouraging them to sign up for alerts from Donald Trump.\nIn March, Mr Miller told Fox News he thinks \"we're going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months\" and \"with his own platform\". \nMr Trump's own platform has been talked about since early this year, but it is unclear what it might look like.\nSome thought From the Desk of Donald J. Trump was the platform he had alluded to, but Mr Miller confirmed in May that it was not, saying: \"we'll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future.\"\nThe former president was an avid user of social media as a way to communicate directly to his followers. \nSince his removal from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, the former president has not been heard from in the same capacity, although this website was the closest he has been to directly communicating with his followers since January.\nMr Trump was an enthusiastic tweeter, often posting throughout the day - and sometimes at night - about an array of topics, including the 2020 election, coronavirus and what he called \"fake news\" to his nearly 90 million followers. \nHe has been permanently banned from Twitter. \nFacebook's Oversight Board recently upheld the platform's decision but ordered Facebook to review it again within six months. \nYouTube has said it will reactivate Mr Trump's account when the threat of \"real-world violence\" reduces."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's latest coronavirus data looks encouraging, a government adviser has said, amid a debate over whether to end restrictions in England on 21 June.\nSir John Bell, part of the government's vaccine taskforce, said there needed to be \"balance\" to the discussion.\nOn Tuesday the UK announced zero Covid deaths for the first time since the pandemic began.\nThe PM has reiterated that nothing in the data suggested the next stage of lifting lockdown could not go ahead.\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said he remained cautious as it was unclear how protected the population would be against a new surge. \nHe said data on that was \"still ambiguous\" and scientists needed longer to look at it.\n\"I'm sorry that's frustrating for people, I know that people want a clear answer about the way ahead for 21 June but at the moment we have just got to wait a little bit longer,\" he said.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock added there was nothing in the data to suggest the UK was \"definitively off track\".\nHe also said three in four UK adults had now received one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nThe debate about whether or not to end restrictions on 21 June is linked to concern over a recent rise in cases and the spread of the more transmissible variant first identified in India, now known as Delta.\nThe UK recorded a further 4,330 infections on Wednesday and another 12 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe rise in cases has led some scientists to suggest a delay to the last stage of the government's roadmap in England for lifting lockdown, which would remove all legal limits on how many people you can meet.\nA final decision on whether restrictions will be relaxed will be reached on 14 June.\nSir John, regius professor of medicine at University of Oxford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's \"numbers don't look too intimidating\" and he was \"encouraged\" by what he saw.\nHowever, he said the government was taking \"a wise approach\" in being cautious ahead of making its decision.\n\"I do think we need to keep our eye on hospitalisations, serious disease and deaths which is really what we are trying to manage,\" he said.\n\"If we scamper down a rabbit hole every time we see a new variant we are going to spend a long time huddled away so we do need to keep a bit of balance to the discussion and keep our eyes on the serious disease that we are trying to prevent.\"\nThe timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. \nIn Wales, the health minister has said the easing of restrictions - due to be reviewed on Thursday - could be affected by a \"very serious\" cluster of the Delta variant in Conwy county.\nIt comes a day after the relaxing of measures in Scotland was paused for millions of people in areas where cases have been rising.\nIn Northern Ireland, some restrictions were lifted on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June.  \nThe UK has now reported more than 3,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row, but hospital admissions remain below 1,000 - compared to nearly 40,000 during January's peak.\nLatest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the number of weekly Covid deaths was at its lowest level since September.\nThe number of deaths registered in the week ending 21 May was 115 - 49 fewer than the previous week and the lowest since 83 were reported for the week ending 4 September.\nThe NHS Confederation, which represents health and care leaders, said the ONS figures were reassuring but \"the race is not yet won\". \nDr Layla McCay, director of policy, said: \"It is of real concern that cases are climbing quickly, and our members are increasingly worried that this will lead to more hospital admissions.\"\nIndustry leaders have warned that any change to the proposed dates for relaxing lockdown measures would be devastating for businesses.\nThe UK Weddings Taskforce, which was set up during the pandemic to represent the sector, said 50,000 ceremonies were expected to take place in the month after 21 June and any delay could cost the weddings industry hundreds of millions of pounds. \nSarah Haywood, from the UK Weddings Taskforce, told BBC Radio 5 Live that all she saw was scientists saying they might need to wait a bit longer but \"how much longer and for what\".\n\"It's preposterous for the government to suggest that the wedding sector can't be trusted to work in a Covid-secure way,\" she said."

      "text": "Contact tracing is seen as an important part of controlling the spread of Covid-19. Wales' system has consistently managed to reach the majority of cases and their close contacts, despite the pressure of rising numbers. But what's it like to work in this new role? \nBridget Thomas' job at the North East Wales Archive has long allowed her to indulge her passion for history - but this year she's been playing a part in the historical events of 2020.\nThe archive is run by Flintshire and Denbighshire councils, and the 59-year-old was internally redeployed in June, splitting her time between her normal job and using her research skills as a tracer for Test, Trace, Protect (TTP).\n\"I wanted to do something to help. I can't work on a ward in a hospital, but I can do this,\" she said.\nHer role, after a period of training, has entailed calling people who have tested positive to ask - and sometimes persuade - them to name the people they have been in contact with. \nThe positive cases are normally expecting the call - but tracers like Mrs Thomas know nothing about them. \n\"It can be quite intense. I deal with people of all ages, and people in care home settings, families, people who are very ill, or people who have been recently bereaved by Covid - it could be any scenario,\" she said.\n\"But people are disarmingly honest and open. Sometimes they'll say 'I know I shouldn't have done that', but I brush over that - it's done and gone.\n\"They generally don't seem worried for themselves. They worry about other people - infecting their children, or infecting their elderly parents if they care for them. \n\"We're not clinicians and there is a system in place to escalate [non-emergency medical queries].\"  \nThe names the positive cases give them are passed on to TTP \"contact advisers\", who call to tell them to self-isolate for 14 days and keep in touch daily. \nMrs Thomas said some of the people she called were concerned about their jobs and about naming close contacts \"because obviously you're implicating a work colleague for example, and making them isolate at home for 14 days\".\nShe said local knowledge - for example the location of workplaces, schools and colleges - helped with identifying potential clusters of cases. \nWhen she first started, she noticed patterns of transmission in places like hospitals, care homes and work places. \nBut \"viruses love parties\" and over the summer more cases were linked to barbecues, birthday gatherings, pubs and tourists returning from holiday.\n\"As we progressed into autumn, it was then schools and colleges,\" she said. \"The one constant has been healthcare staff - and now [it's winter and] people are staying in, I'm seeing more infection spreading within families. \"\nTracers are looking for people who may be at risk of infection because they have been in contact with a positive case during the 48 hours before they developed symptoms or, if someone is asymptomatic, during the 48 hours before they took the test, up to 10 full days afterwards. \nA close contact includes anyone who:\nThe Covid-19 contact tracing app is supposed to kick in if you've been near a positive case in a shop for example. \nFlintshire council is employing all the TTP staff for the counties in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area.\nSenior HR manager Sharon Carney said: \"We need people with good listening skills, who are quite empathetic and politely persistent. We train them to listen to the pauses - is there something the person is not saying?\"\nThey began recruiting externally in August, and new team members include hospitality workers, aircraft cabin crew and a retired police officer.\nMany have said they are motivated by wanting to help.\n\"But we all wish it would go away,\" Mrs Thomas said.\nHaving dealt so closely with bereaved people this summer, Mrs Thomas reiterated that every Covid death is a tragedy, but her archive experience has also allowed her to put the current pandemic in its historical context. \n\"It's new to us - but it happened with Spanish flu, the plague, cholera. \n\"I came across a record from 1839 the other day that was a request from a parish council to the magistrates, asking for funeral wakes to be banned because they were spreading cholera,\" she said. \n\"We also hold education logbooks for local schools from 1862... usually written by the head teacher [providing] a social record of how prevalent childhood diseases like measles, diphtheria, influenza, and scarlet fever were before mass vaccination. \n\"Whole classes would regularly be required to stay at home, not only to deep-clean classrooms but also to stop transmission of disease.  Unfortunately, school log books also record many deaths of children from disease.\n\"What our ancestors had to put up with was unbelievable. Covid-19 will be over one day. We just have to get through it.\"\nAs case numbers rose, the overall speed of TTP in Wales slowed down relatively, although it picked up to a degree in November as the \"firebreak\" took effect. \nAlthough the system has generally reached more than 80% of cases and close contacts, in reality the huge rise in transmission since September has meant thousands have not been contacted at all.\nOverall since June, TTP in Wales has reached 47,992 positive cases, and 132,323 people \"close contacts\".\nAlmost 1,800 tracers and contact advisers are in place across Wales and the Welsh Government has put forward more funding to councils to recruit a further 1,300 staff for the winter.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has announced zero daily Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test for the first time since March 2020.\nThe latest figures also reported another 3,165 new cases, compared with 3,383 on Monday and 2,493 one week ago.\nIt comes amid concern over a recent small rise in cases linked to the variant first identified in India.\nReports of daily deaths are often lower at weekends and at the start of the week.\nThis is because less counting takes place while statisticians are off - and adding in the bank holiday weekend will make this figure less certain still.\nAny deaths that happen on Tuesday will be reported in days to come.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the whole country would be \"so glad\" to hear the news. \nHe added: \"The vaccines are clearly working - protecting you, those around you and your loved ones.  \n\"But despite this undoubtedly good news we know we haven't beaten this virus yet, and with cases continuing to rise please remember hands, face, space and let in fresh air when indoors, and of course, make sure when you can you get both jabs.\"\nMeanwhile, Public Health England's medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said the death figure was \"encouraging\", but echoed the health secretary's call for people to get a vaccine due to rising cases.\nIt is a blessed relief for the government to announce no deaths in their daily figures for the first time since the pandemic got going. \nThere are always ifs and buts. \nToday's deaths tell us what was happening with infections a month ago and, right now, it looks like the virus is on the rise again from its current low base. \nAnd the daily count isn't a perfect picture: some people who died over the bank holiday may have their passing reported on Wednesday.\nIn fact, according to the UK's current definition, deaths within four weeks of a positive test, there was a day with no reportable deaths last summer - on 30 July. \nBut the government did announce some deaths on that day as they were using a different definition at the time. \nThe pandemic is far from over, but this is a unique day in its history to date. \nWe can celebrate it and hope that we'll see more like it in the near future. \nThe UK's daily death rate, the number of people being admitted to hospital and those catching the virus have fallen from a peak reached in January. \nThis comes against the backdrop of the increasing numbers of people receiving the first or second dose of a vaccine. \nMore than a third of the adult population have now received both doses.\nThe latest figures show 25,734,719 people in the UK have had two jabs, while 39,477,158 - some 74.9% of the adult population - have received a first dose.\nHowever, the success of the UK's vaccination programme does not mean that the battle with Covid is over, a scientist advising the government has said.\nEarlier, Prof Adam Finn said the country remained vulnerable as there were still large numbers of unvaccinated people.\nThere have been calls to delay ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 June amid warnings of a third wave.\nBut earlier Downing Street reiterated that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had seen nothing in the data to suggest the plan would need to be postponed.\nA final decision on the last stage of the government's roadmap in England for lifting lockdown - which would remove all limits on how many people you can meet - will be reached on 14 June.\nThe timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. \nIn Scotland, the easing of restrictions has been paused for millions - but rules are to be relaxed in Glasgow from Saturday.\nIn Wales, there is due to be a review on 3 June. In Northern Ireland, some measures were relaxed on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June.  \nThe UK has now reported more than 3,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row.\nThis increase in cases comes amid the spread of the more transmissible Indian variant, now known as Delta - after the World Health Organization announced new names for Covid-19 variants using letters of the Greek alphabet.\nThe Delta variant - also known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to account for up to three quarters of new cases in the UK, and has been linked to a surge in cases in some parts of the country."

      "tags": "Yair Lapid,Israel,Naftali Bennett,Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "text": "Israeli opposition parties have reached an agreement to form a new government that would end Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year tenure as prime minister.\nYair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, announced an eight-faction coalition had been formed.\nUnder a rotation arrangement, the head of the right-wing Yamina party, Naftali Bennett, would serve as prime minister first before handing over to Mr Lapid.\nMr Netanyahu, however, attacked the new \"left-wing\" government as \"dangerous\".\nIn his first comments since the agreement was reached, Mr Netanyahu urged Knesset (parliament) members \"elected by votes from the right\" to oppose the coalition, which still needs to be approved by a parliamentary vote before being sworn in.\nThe vote is not expected to take place for some days, and there is still a chance this newly formed coalition could be upended by defections. \nIn a statement, Mr Lapid said he had informed President Reuven Rivlin of the agreement, adding: \"I pledge that this government will work in the service of all Israeli citizens, those who voted for it and those who did not.\n\"It will respect its opponents and do everything in its power to unite and connect all parts of Israeli society.\"\nAn image carried on Israeli media showed Mr Lapid, Mr Bennett and Mansour Abbas, leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party, signing the agreement, a deal many thought impossible.\nThis is the first time in decades an Israeli Arab party has joined a governing coalition. Other parties representing Israeli Arabs - who make up 20% of the population - have said they will oppose a government led by Mr Bennett, who rejects the concept of a Palestinian state, AFP news agency reports.\nMr Abbas told reporters: \"The decision was hard and there were several disputes but it was important to reach agreements.\" He said that there were \"many things in this agreement for the benefit of Arab society\". \nNo rational political enemy of Benjamin Netanyahu can underestimate his tenacity, ruthlessness and absolute determination to hold on to office. Until a new government with a new prime minister is sworn in, he will do all he can to stop it. \nIf he found himself leader of the opposition, he would do all he could to destabilise a coalition with a wafer-thin majority that would be trying to span the entire Israeli spectrum, from the nationalist right to the liberal left. \nAll that unites them is their desire to remove him from office. \nMr Netanyahu has already called the proposed new government the \"fraud of the century\". He says it endangers the state of Israel, the people of Israel, and the soldiers of Israel. However loudly he complains, the likelihood is that he is leaving office. In the end his defeat was sealed not by left-wing opponents but by fellow right-wingers he has made into enemies by his ruthless, high-handed tactics. \nNo-one should expect big, new initiatives from a new government. Just surviving the onslaught Mr Netanyahu is undoubtedly planning will be a full-time job. His opponents will be hoping that his fall will continue in the Jerusalem courthouse where he is already on trial on serious corruption charges.\nIn his note to the president, Mr Lapid said he would head the government alongside Mr Bennett, who he would replace as prime minister on 27 August 2023.\nMr Rivlin has called on parliament to convene as soon as possible to hold the confidence vote.\nIf the coalition fails to win the support of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, there is a risk of the country having to go to elections for the fifth time in two years.\nThe coalition members span the full spectrum of Israeli politics. The parties have little in common apart from their plan to replace Mr Netanyahu.\nThey are:\nAll eight factions were needed to pass the 61 majority figure.\nWednesday's marathon talks took place in a hotel near Tel Aviv, with a large number of issues - from legalising cannabis to fines for illegal construction to the rotation of judicial selection committee posts - all on the agenda.\nIsraeli media suggested that not all the elements were finalised, and this could still create doubts over whether the coalition will win its confidence vote.\nMr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party won the most seats in March's inconclusive poll. He was given the first chance to form a government but was unable to build a viable coalition. \nMr Netanyahu had called the proposed new government the \"fraud of the century\", saying it endangered the state and people of Israel."

      "text": "The boss of Wetherspoons has denied claims his pubs are facing a staff shortage caused by Brexit.\nIt comes after Tim Martin was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying he favoured a more \"liberal\" visa scheme for EU workers to tackle shortfalls.\nMr Martin, a vocal Brexit supporter, told the BBC he had always favoured an Australian style system which treated near neighbours preferentially. \nThere was \"no recruitment issue\" other than in small coastal towns, he added. \nMany hospitality businesses have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, and firms are reportedly now struggling to recruit as they reopen. \nAccording to trade group UK Hospitality, Brexit has added to the problem, as more EU workers return to their home countries.\nAccording to the Telegraph, Mr Martin said a more flexible visa system for EU workers could help ease the pressure on firms. \n\"The UK has a low birth rate. A reasonably liberal immigration system controlled by those we have elected, as distinct from the EU system, would be a plus for the economy and the country,\" he told the paper. \n\"America, Australia and Singapore have benefited for many decades from this approach. Immigration combined with democracy works.\"\nHowever, Mr Martin later told the BBC the comment has been taken out of context. \nHe added that Wetherspoons was not struggling to recruit, and in some towns, such as Northallerton, jobs at its pubs were oversubscribed.\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics in April suggest that more than one in 10 UK hospitality workers left the industry in the last year.\nJames Reed, chief executive of the Reed employment agency, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the firm was advertising 275,000 new jobs in the sector in May.  \n\"When we added them up we had more jobs in May than in any month since February 2008,\" he said.\nHotel chain Best Western said it could not open some of its venues at full capacity due to staffing shortages.\nBoss Rob Paterson told the BBC: \"One hotel didn't have the cleaning staff to be able to sell all of their rooms.\n\"It's becoming restrictive on trade, at a time when we're investing so much on meeting safety precautions and needing more staff to do that.\" \nHe said uncertainty and a fear of being repeatedly furloughed had driven some employees away.\n\"They don't want to be in a hospitality industry that's shutting down and opening up and their jobs are always at risk. It's not just about pay conditions,\" said Mr Paterson.\nUK Hospitality has urged the government to encourage UK-based workers to join the sector.\nIt is also asking the government to renew its list of shortage occupations and consider a visa scheme for workers who would not qualify under the points-based system.\nOver the past 12 months Wetherspoons, which has 871 pubs, has reduced the number of staff by about 6,000 to almost 38,000."

      "tags": "Tulsa,US race relations,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Joe Biden has become the first sitting president to commemorate the 1921 Tulsa Massacre - one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history.\nMr Biden flew to Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Tuesday to mark the 100th anniversary of the attack, which claimed up to 300 African-American lives.\nThe two days of violence, sparked by a white mob, were largely erased from history for decades.\nIt re-entered the national discourse amid racial justice protests last year.\nOn 31 May 1921, a group of white Americans razed the affluent and predominantly black neighbourhood of Greenwood in Tulsa.\nThe community - known by the moniker of \"Black Wall Street\" - was the country's wealthiest African-American neighbourhood until its many homes and businesses were burned down in the riot.\nIn addition to the lives lost, many more black Americans were left injured or homeless.\nIn the years following the incident, many official records were lost or destroyed, and schools did not teach about the massacre.\nSpeaking in Tulsa on Tuesday, Mr Biden said: \"For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness.\"\n\"My fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre, and among the worst in our history. But not the only one.\"\nLess than two years after the Tulsa massacre, a white mob destroyed the black town of Rosewood in rural Florida.\nOn 31 May, Mr Biden issued a proclamation for a day of remembrance.\n\"We honour the legacy of the Greenwood community and of Black Wall Street by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts,\" read a statement from the White House.\nOnly three survivors of the massacre - currently aged between 101 and 107 - are still alive. Mr Biden is expected to meet them during his trip.\nThe president began his visit on Tuesday with a tour of the Hall of Survivors, an exhibit about the massacre at the Greenwood Cultural Center.\nOn Monday, Tulsa Mayor GT Bynum posted an apology on behalf of the city government for its failure to protect the community and \"to do right by the victims\".\n\"While no municipal elected official in Tulsa today was alive in 1921, we are the stewards of the same government and an apology for those failures is ours to deliver,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\"The victims - men, women, young children - deserved better from their city, and I am sorry they didn't receive it.\"\nGreenwood was a unique sight in pre-civil rights America: a prosperous community where predominantly black citizens thrived at a time of racial discrimination and segregation.\nThe actions of rioters reportedly erased decades of black wealth and wealth creation.\nTestifying before Congress last month, one survivor - 107-year-old Viola Fletcher - said: \"We lost everything that day... Greenwood represented all the best of what was possible for black people in America.\"\nAt the start of his presidency, Mr Biden said racial justice would be one of his top causes in office.\nAs part of his visit to Tulsa, he is expected to tout several new housing and small business programmes the White House hopes can narrow the wealth gap between black and white Americans.\nThe Biden administration says it will address racial discrimination in the housing market by issuing new rules on fair housing practices and curbing inequities in the home appraisal process.\nAnother programme involves increasing federal contracts with small, minority-owned, businesses by 50% over the next five years. \nIn addition, Mr Biden's proposed infrastructure package includes new initiatives aimed at expanding economic opportunities for minority Americans.\nThis includes a $10bn (\u00a37bn) community revitalisation fund, which would send money to underserved neighbourhoods like Greenwood.\nThe plan also proposes putting $31bn toward increasing access to capital and technical assistance for small business initiatives, with a focus on \"socially and economically disadvantaged\" firms. It also calls for a new tax credit for private investments in affordable housing.\nHowever, left-wing activists expressed disappointment over the president's reluctance to cancel student loan debt, or address financial reparations for black descendants of slavery and racial violence."

Investigators say that attack was also linked to a group with ties to Russia.\nColonial Pipeline has confirmed it paid a $4.4m (\u00a33.1m) ransom to the cyber-criminal gang responsible.\nThe US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future."

      "text": "If schools in England are going to be given catch-up funding, what do students think would help them recover from the pandemic?\nIt's a thumbs down for proposals such as a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday, in the firm opinion of a group of sixth formers in Crawley, West Sussex.\nAnd having spent too much time on laptop learning during the lockdown, they're lukewarm-to-tepid about the prospect of more online tutoring.\nThese articulate 16 to 18-year-old students at St Wilfrid's Catholic school want something perhaps unexpected - and it doesn't come with a price tag.\n\"Certainty. It would be so beneficial for students,\" says Katelan. They want to know what's happening next.\n\"It feels like the pandemic has been constant pressure and uncertainty,\" says the Year 12 student.\nThey want a break from the long months of worrying, the confusion, the chopping and changing. They seem to want some calming continuity, not the thunderflashes of big ideas and extra initiatives.\nApart from the wider stresses of the pandemic on their families, in school they've faced a constant drip-feed of uncertainty about exams, they've been in and out of school, masks on, masks off, they've been cut off from friends and seen big milestones like proms cancelled.\nRather than cramming in more catch-up hours, these students want to plan with more confidence. For instance, how will next year's A-levels be run when so much time has already been lost?\n\"The most important thing the government could give us as students is clarity. And clarity early on and not just a few months before we're due to take the exams,\" says Catherine, expecting to take her A-levels next summer.\nShe wants to know that exams will be fair to their disrupted year group, with different amounts of missed time, and that there won't be any last-minute changes.\nThey were really glad to return to school in March after the winter lockdown - and you get the impression that they really crave some normality.\n\"Every student wanted to be back in the classroom. When it's in-person it's just so more enjoyable,\" says Katelan.\nIt's their own teachers they want to see in front of them, not sessions with online tutors.\n\"If you're learning off a PowerPoint, it's just very 2-D and not interesting,\" says Katelan.\n\"It's also the social side,\" says Pavni. \"The teachers say something and you've cracked a joke about it and you remember it.\"\n\"I don't think online catch-up will be very good,\" says Louie. Although the extra tutoring being proposed could also be face-to-face.\nThe idea of longer school days has been widely trailed as a way of helping pupils who have fallen behind, with suggestions it could be part of a multi-billion, multi-year deal, along with tutoring and more training and development for teachers.\nBut Thomas, in Year 13, says the priority should be quality rather than quantity and stretching the day would be counter-productive if it leaves pupils \"fatigued and lethargic\".\nWhile the catch-up plans will focus on lost learning, for young people there were more than exams cancelled last year. There was the abrupt end of school, the unsaid goodbyes, the loss of proms and parties, the post-exam festivals and holidays.\n\"Everything was either cancelled or rushed,\" says Katelan.\nAnd there's trepidation about what lies ahead.\nThomas has made his top choice for a university place in the autumn - but says the lack of any visit there has left him uncertain.\n\"It's daunting that I had to apply to university without every having a feel of the town or the environment. The best I got was an hour taster course on Zoom with 400 other people,\" he says.\nCrawley in leafy Sussex might not fit any stereotypes of deprivation, but the local economy has taken a hammering in the pandemic from the disruption to nearby Gatwick airport, the biggest local employer.\nAccording to the think tank Centre for Cities, Crawley has faced one of the worst \"economic shocks\" in England, going from relative prosperity to having the highest share of people on furlough and one of the biggest increases in unemployment.\n\"There were a lot of low-paid jobs lost, people who were just about managing,\" says St Wilfrid's head teacher, Michael Ferry, whose school had to open a food bank for struggling families.\nFree school meal numbers rose sharply, he says, and the school provided computer equipment, internet access and food vouchers in addition to what was supplied by the government.\nThe head teacher says the role of the school has become much wider - it's not just about teaching but \"putting food on the table for families\".\nThe debate about catch-up needs to recognise how uneven the impact of the pandemic has been, says Mr Ferry. There is no one-size-fits-all for how much pupils have fallen behind.\n\"It's widened the gap between the educational haves and have-nots,\" he says.\nHigh-achieving, well-supported students, with all the right computer equipment at home, will be making better progress than ever, says the head teacher.\nWhile in another class there could be a low-achieving student with multiple disadvantages at home who will fallen even further behind.\nMr Ferry argues that a recovery plan needs to address the root causes of this divide, which he says are \"child poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of parental skills\".\n\"It's not just about money for education. It needs to be a co-ordinated plan that brings in health, mental health, police, social care and education.\"\nMr Ferry has his own very practical checklist of what is needed from any recovery funding.\n\"I want a fully staffed maths department,\" he says, wanting catch-up funding to be invested in getting the right staff for schools.\n\"I want students to come into school having had a breakfast,\" he says, addressing child poverty.\nAnd when it comes to mental health, he wants support to be available much more quickly.\n\"There's a significant minority who haven't coped very well,\" he says, but getting to see mental health services can be a wait of \"six months if you're lucky\".\n\"They're overwhelmed, so is social care,\" he says.\nMr Ferry remains unconvinced by the impact of tutoring - and doesn't want any of the catch-up plans to be \"chuck money at it and hope it works\".\nHe questions whether a longer school day would disrupt what's already on offer.\n\"We have a large number of pupils who stay back every night anyway,\" he says, with sports, drama and arts clubs and extra catch-up lessons. Exam revision classes already take place over holidays and half terms.\nThat's not to mention the extra pressure on school staff, the risk of burn-out and the financial cost of longer hours, he says.\nAfter two academic years of major disruption, it's not difficult to see the pressure to fill the gaps in learning. The current generation in school shouldn't be disadvantaged by the pandemic. They shouldn't miss out on a fair chance to get qualifications.\nBut since the first lockdown in March 2020, Mr Ferry says he has not had a break, working almost every day, including weekends and holidays. \nHe's not expecting any sympathy, and the pressure of the pandemic has affected many sectors, but this has been a marathon effort for many people and families. Recovery, for students and staff, will have to be measured in many different ways. "

      "tags": "Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,UK aid,International aid,Humanitarian aid",
      "text": "The UK's temporarily cutting back money it gives to other countries, in a move which some charities say will harm poor communities around the world.\nThe government says the impact of the pandemic on the UK's finances means there has to be a temporary reduction in foreign aid.\nThe target for foreign aid spend has usually been 0.7% of gross national income - but that will come down to 0.5% which will be around \u00a34bn less.\nBut what is the money actually used for?\nIn 2020, Britain spent \u00a314.5bn on aid, meeting that 0.7% target, according to provisional data.\nThere's always been debate over the UK's aid spend, with some people saying the UK shouldn't be helping people overseas while cutting services at home.\nThey argue problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability which makes foreign aid worthless.\nOthers say it's a mark of the UK's generosity and helps address the difference in wealth between developed and developing countries - and helping to save lives.\nIn its most basic definition, foreign aid is resources given from one country to another.\nIt can involve a transfer of things like food or military equipment, or even people to provide training and medical help.\nUsually these are loaned by governments, organisations and individuals in richer countries to help people in poorer countries.\nAn example would be the UK sending \u00a3200m to help developing nations battle coronavirus.\nThere are different types of aid, such as emergency or short-term aid which is needed after sudden disasters such as earthquakes, flooding or tsunamis.\nConditional or tied aid is when one country donates money or resources to another but with conditions attached, for example a trade deal.\nThere is also aid funded by donations from the public through charities such as Children in Need.\nLong-term or development aid involves providing local communities with education and skills.\nMoney shared through international organisations such as the World Bank or UN, rather than by one specific country, is called multilateral aid.\nOverall, the top five countries receiving UK aid were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Nigeria, with almost all the money going to countries in Africa and Asia.\nIn 2019, the UK spent \u00a31.5bn on humanitarian assistance - which is short-term help in immediate crises - mostly in Yemen, Syria and Bangladesh, statistics show.\nAround \u00a31.4bn was spent on health projects including medical research, family planning and infectious disease control globally.\nThere will be cuts across lots of different areas.\n\"The impact will be profound and very damaging, particularly for poor people,\" says Professor Guy Howard, an expert in international development from the University of Bristol.\nThe UN Population Fund, which supports family planning, says an initial commitment by the UK to spend \u00a3154m on supplies this year will shrink to \u00a323m - and there'll also be a drop in funding to the UN's children fund, Unicef.\nAnd funding for things like water, sanitation and hygiene projects will reportedly be cut by more than 80%.\nProf Howard feels cutting back aid from a \"core public health area seems odd.\"\nHe wants to see a reverse to cuts in water and sanitation because \"that's the foundation of public health\" and vital in dealing with different diseases.\n\"We often forget a thousand children a day die of diarrhoea because of poor water sanitation.\"\nIt's an important goal in its own right, he says, \"but what Covid has shown us is just how important water supply is in combatting the disease.\n\"If you have to collect water from a shared water point, social distancing will be virtually impossible.\"\nAs the amount the UK donates is a percentage of national income, the amount of money it spends on foreign aid would have been less this year even before the cut was announced. That's because the economy's got smaller during the pandemic.\nBut Prof Howard says the decision to cut 0.2% makes it an even more difficult situation for the countries which receive the aid.\nSeveral countries have met the 0.7% UN aid target including Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nBut many others don't hit the target.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a \"strategic shift\" in UK aid spending.\nA spokeswoman from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office told Newsbeat reducing spend was a \"tough but necessary decision\" and the government's \"committed to returning to 0.7%\" once the financial situation allows.\nMore than \u00a31bn will be spent on Covid and global health, \u00a3500m towards tackling climate change and \u00a3400m on getting girls into education.\nMuch of the humanitarian aid budget will be focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "text": "Cuts to humanitarian aid by the UK are a \"tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people\", 200 charities said in a joint statement.\nOrganisations including Save the Children and Oxfam said humanitarian assistance was being reduced by more than \u00a3500m.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a \"strategic shift\" in UK aid spending.\nHe also said the \u00a318m aid budget given to China will be reduced to \u00a3900,000.\nFollowing the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis,  the chancellor cut the foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around \u00a34bn.\nThe Foreign Office controls 80% of aid spending - \u00a38bn - and the priorities were set out by Mr Raab in a written statement.\nMore than \u00a31bn will be spent on Covid and global health, \u00a3500m towards tackling climate change and \u00a3400m on getting girls into education. \nMr Raab said it was a \"challenging financial climate\" due to Covid-19, but said the government had sought \"maximum strategic coherence, impact and value for taxpayers' money\".\nBut aid charities said even the priority areas were receiving less than before, and \u00a3500m less was being spent on humanitarian aid.\nThe 200 charities, which also include Christian Aid and Care International, said: \"Today's announcement is a tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people the UK once supported, and for the UK's reputation as a trusted development partner. \n\"The government has not even spared countries ravaged by humanitarian crisis, disease, war and poverty.\"\nKevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, accused the government of \"making cuts with no consideration for the human harm they will cause\" after reducing aid in Yemen, \"the world's biggest humanitarian crisis\".\nThe government announced it was cutting foreign aid last November but it has still to say precisely where the axe will fall. Charities are waiting anxiously to see which programmes will lose funding, and which will survive. \nBut we are getting some indications from government now about its priorities: climate change, Covid and global health, girls' education, supporting open societies, trade and economic development and so on. \nThe numbers announced by the Foreign Office allow charities to calculate how much less will be spent on each area than before. That will help them plan. What these numbers will not do is diminish the controversy. \nMinisters argue the decision to cut aid has been made, it is time to decide how best to make it happen. \nBut aid charities and many MPs - including a goodly number of Conservatives - still oppose the cuts and are working to stop them. Plans for a legal challenge are being considered. \nCritics say the government can't ignore a legally binding target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. \nThe FCDO reckons it can make the cuts without holding a vote to change the law. Campaigners might want a judge to decide who is right. \nFor now, the government is pressing ahead with cuts it says are needed to keep the Treasury in funds for other priorities. \nOf the \u00a38bn, the Foreign Office will give more than \u00a33bn to multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank.\nHalf of all UK bilateral aid will be spent in Africa, a third in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia.\nThe remaining humanitarian aid budget, focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan, is \u00a3906m.\nMr Raab also announced he would cut Foreign Office aid to China by 95%, to \u00a3900,000.\nBut other parts of government, such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, give more aid to China and have yet to say if they will cut their payments too."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's latest coronavirus data looks encouraging, a government adviser has said, amid a debate over whether to end restrictions in England on 21 June.\nSir John Bell, part of the government's vaccine taskforce, said there needed to be \"balance\" to the discussion.\nOn Tuesday the UK announced zero Covid deaths for the first time since the pandemic began.\nThe PM has reiterated that nothing in the data suggested the next stage of lifting lockdown could not go ahead.\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said he remained cautious as it was unclear how protected the population would be against a new surge. \nHe said data on that was \"still ambiguous\" and scientists needed longer to look at it.\n\"I'm sorry that's frustrating for people, I know that people want a clear answer about the way ahead for 21 June but at the moment we have just got to wait a little bit longer,\" he said.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock added there was nothing in the data to suggest the UK was \"definitively off track\".\nHe also said three in four UK adults had now received one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nThe debate about whether or not to end restrictions on 21 June is linked to concern over a recent rise in cases and the spread of the more transmissible variant first identified in India, now known as Delta.\nThe UK recorded a further 4,330 infections on Wednesday and another 12 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe rise in cases has led some scientists to suggest a delay to the last stage of the government's roadmap in England for lifting lockdown, which would remove all legal limits on how many people you can meet.\nA final decision on whether restrictions will be relaxed will be reached on 14 June.\nSir John, regius professor of medicine at University of Oxford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's \"numbers don't look too intimidating\" and he was \"encouraged\" by what he saw.\nHowever, he said the government was taking \"a wise approach\" in being cautious ahead of making its decision.\n\"I do think we need to keep our eye on hospitalisations, serious disease and deaths which is really what we are trying to manage,\" he said.\n\"If we scamper down a rabbit hole every time we see a new variant we are going to spend a long time huddled away so we do need to keep a bit of balance to the discussion and keep our eyes on the serious disease that we are trying to prevent.\"\nThe timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. \nIn Wales, the health minister has said the easing of restrictions - due to be reviewed on Thursday - could be affected by a \"very serious\" cluster of the Delta variant in Conwy county.\nIt comes a day after the relaxing of measures in Scotland was paused for millions of people in areas where cases have been rising.\nIn Northern Ireland, some restrictions were lifted on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June.  \nThe UK has now reported more than 3,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row, but hospital admissions remain below 1,000 - compared to nearly 40,000 during January's peak.\nLatest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the number of weekly Covid deaths was at its lowest level since September.\nThe number of deaths registered in the week ending 21 May was 115 - 49 fewer than the previous week and the lowest since 83 were reported for the week ending 4 September.\nThe NHS Confederation, which represents health and care leaders, said the ONS figures were reassuring but \"the race is not yet won\". \nDr Layla McCay, director of policy, said: \"It is of real concern that cases are climbing quickly, and our members are increasingly worried that this will lead to more hospital admissions.\"\nIndustry leaders have warned that any change to the proposed dates for relaxing lockdown measures would be devastating for businesses.\nThe UK Weddings Taskforce, which was set up during the pandemic to represent the sector, said 50,000 ceremonies were expected to take place in the month after 21 June and any delay could cost the weddings industry hundreds of millions of pounds. \nSarah Haywood, from the UK Weddings Taskforce, told BBC Radio 5 Live that all she saw was scientists saying they might need to wait a bit longer but \"how much longer and for what\".\n\"It's preposterous for the government to suggest that the wedding sector can't be trusted to work in a Covid-secure way,\" she said."

This variant of concern will become uncontrollable and people will die.\"\nNearly seven million people have been in lockdown since 27 May, after the state recorded its first cases in the community in nearly three months.\nFor another seven days, people in the state capital Melbourne will be required to stay at home except for essential work, shopping, exercise, caregiving or to get a Covid vaccine. \nNo gatherings are allowed. Some measures have been eased including the expansion of travel limits to within 10km (6.1 miles) of the home, and senior school students will be allowed to return to the classroom.\nOutside the state capital, restrictions will be relaxed for regional towns with limited outdoor gatherings and the re-opening of restaurants.\nBut Mr Merlino warned people to remain cautious. He said there are more than 350 places where people may have been exposed to the virus, including camping spots in the neighbouring state of New South Wales after a Melbourne resident travelled there.\n\"No one - no one - wants to repeat last winter,\" he said, referencing Melbourne's second wave last year which caused over 90% of deaths nationwide.\nThe state endured a 112-day lockdown to bring the case rate back to zero.\nVictoria's new outbreak has highlighted the low level of vaccination among Australians - a task that has been the responsibility of the federal government.\nLess than 2% of the population has been vaccinated. Cases reported in aged care homes in Melbourne this week have also fuelled criticism of the flawed rollout. \nThe government had pledged it would prioritise vaccines for vulnerable groups like the elderly, but was forced to admit yesterday it did not know how many vaccinations had occurred in aged care homes amid reports of widespread delays.\nThe Victorian outbreak marks the biggest case increase in Australia since October. \nThe nation has largely avoided the level of Covid deaths seen in many other developed nations due to a stringent system of snap lockdowns, border controls and movement restrictions.\nOfficials say this outbreak has been traced to a traveller who tested positive days after finishing quarantine in South Australia. \nIt's believed he contracted the virus through airborne transmission from an infected traveller in another room- throwing up questions over the safety of hotel quarantine.\nAre you in Victoria?

He was going to stay there with her, he always did.\"\nSir Keir said the death of his mother, just a few weeks before he was elected as an MP in 2015, \"broke\" his father, adding that afterwards, \"he lived but he didn't recover\". \nBut asked by Morgan what he would like to have said to his mother before she died, Sir Keir said: \"I love you.\"\nReturning to his father, Morgan pointed to the difficult relationship the pair had, which Sir Keir has spoken about openly before. \nThe Labour leader said that, despite his achievements in law and in politics, \"I only remember him once saying he was proud of me... when I passed the 11 plus, that was it\".\nAsked how he categorised his relationship with his father, Sir Keir added: \"Distant. He was not emotional. He was a difficult man. He didn't much like company.\"\nBut he said that he did learn lessons from him, including \"a sense of duty [and] a strong sense of pride and dignity in work\".\nAnd he revealed to Morgan that the relationship had had an impact on him as a father.\n\"I will be different with my kids,\" he said. \"I do hug them, I do tell them I love them, they will know me, I will know them in a way I probably didn't know my dad.\"\nSir Keir has been married to his wife, Victoria, since 2007, and she sat in the audience to watch the interview take place.\nBut when Morgan asked him how the pair had met, it was not the most romantic tale. \n\"I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate,\" said Sir Keir. \n\"I [asked the team] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said let's get her on the line.\"\nWhen he spoke to her from her office as a ward sister in the NHS, he grilled her on the documents, and before he hung up he heard one comment from her. \n\"She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me,\" Sir Keir said. \"And quite right too.\"\nThe pair now have two children, but Sir Keir revealed they did have time for some A-list lunches, counting Amal Clooney - who he praised as a \"brilliant lawyer\" - and her husband as friends.\n\"George gives quite a lot of advice, including to me, and he has got very strong views on American politics,\" he said. \nTwo years ago, \"a lunch ended up as an afternoon, ended up as an evening\" while they put the world to rights. \n\"There were quite a lot of empty bottles by the end of the evening, but it was great.\"\nWhen Sir Keir was the director of public prosecutions, he became embroiled in a strange case with his face at the centre of it. \nHe described to Morgan how serial conman Paul Bint had posed as Sir Keir with a number of goals in mind. \n\"He answered a lonely hearts column ad in the Sunday Times, not as himself but as me, saying I am Keir Starmer, director of public prosecutions, and two people took him up on his offer,\" he said. \n\"He then moved onto trying to buy a house in my name, trying to buy art in my name and also trying to run up taxi fares in my name.\"\nAnd it was the latter of these crimes that got him caught.\n\"He would take a taxi down to one of the women he was seeing as 'Keir Starmer' in the West Country then say, 'put the bill on Crown Prosecution Service',\" Sir Keir explained.\n\"One of the cabbies turned up at my office and said I want my money and that was when everyone started to realise what was happening.\"\nA jury at Southwark Crown Court found Bint guilty of committing two counts of fraud by false representation, as well as stealing a bracelet, burgling the robing room at St Alban's Crown Court and test driving a \u00a359,000 Audi while disqualified.\nSir Keir said it was awful for the women involved, but he had to see the funny side for himself when one of them appeared in court. \n\"They were shown a picture of me and they had a picture of Paul Bint [and asked] 'did you think this was him?\n\"One of them said, 'well, everyone can have an off day'.\"\nWhile Life Stories explores the personal, the political needed to make an appearance on the ITV show too.\nAsked by Morgan about criticism that he doesn't show enough emotion, the Labour leader said: \"There is a huge passion [in me], but passion comes in different shapes and sizes.\"\nHe promised a tour of the country over the summer to speak to people \"who are no longer voting Labour and hear for myself what they have to say\", appealing for the public to \"let me get out there and let me take the mask off\".\nMorgan pushed him for three policies off the bat he would introduce as prime minister.\n\"First, a first-class education for every child, the second thing is to make sure our economy deals with insecurity and inequality, and the third thing is to put real dignity into older age,\" said Sir Keir.\nBut he also conceded there was a \"huge task\" in turning Labour's fortunes around and it was a \"pivotal moment\" for him and the party.\nFinally, Morgan asked him what message he had for Boris Johnson. He replied: \"Move over. We're coming.\"\nAnd what would he say to him if they were on the football pitch?\n\"I would probably knock him over.\" \nPiers Morgan's Life Stories with Sir Keir Starmer is available on ITV Hub."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Department for Education",
      "text": "The education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, has resigned in a row over the lack of \"credible\" Covid catch-up funding.\nSir Kevan took on the role as catch-up tsar in February to develop a long-term plan to help pupils make up for lost learning during the pandemic.\nBut on Wednesday he stepped down saying the government's funding for the plan \"falls far short of what is needed\".\nHead teachers labelled the \u00a31.4bn cash over three years as a \"damp squib\".\nThe Education Policy Institute had calculated that a catch-up funding recovery would need \u00a313.5bn - and Sir Kevan was reported as having put forward plans costing \u00a315bn.\nThe government's proposal represents \u00a350 per pupil per year - and Sir Kevan wrote to the prime minister saying: \"I do not believe it is credible that a successful recovery can be achieved with a programme of support of this size.\"\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic.\n\"The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over \u00a33bn committed for catch up so far.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, the government announced an extra \u00a31.4bn over three years for education recovery, in addition to the \u00a31.7bn already announced. \nThis included \u00a31bn for 100 million hours of tutoring, aimed at disadvantaged pupils, and \u00a3250m for teacher training and development.\nThe resignation statement from Sir Kevan, reported by The TES, said: \"A half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils. \n\"The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why I have no option but to resign from my post.\"\nHis resignation letter to Boris Johnson said: \"When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support than the government has to date indicated it intends to provide.\"\nThis was a chaotic end to what should have been a showcase of the catch-up plan for England's schools.\nThe widely-respected adviser brought in to deliver the plans walked out in protest - turning a story that should have been about extra money into an awkward debate about the lack of it.\nThe resignation letter from Sir Kevan Collins to the prime minister makes plain that this should not have come as a surprise.\n\"When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support,\" wrote Sir Kevan.\nBoris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had spent the day trying to keep the plans afloat, presenting them as a \"next step\" with more to follow - after strong criticism that the funding was only a tenth of what was required.\nBut Sir Kevan's resignation has fired a torpedo at the government's contention that school recovery is one of its top priorities.\nEarlier, head teachers had said they were \"hugely disappointed\" by the announcement after expectations of a much bigger set of proposals.\nPaul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, described it as a \"damp squib\" and said \"education recovery cannot be done on the cheap\".\nAs such, he said: \"It is completely understandable that Sir Kevan chose not to become a pawn in whatever game the government is playing.\"\nMr Johnson then reassured schools and parents that more funding would be \"coming down the track\".\nSir Kevan had been responsible for overseeing efforts to help schools in England recover from the disruption of the pandemic and lockdowns, which has seen pupils studying from home and exams cancelled over two academic years.\nHe had reportedly called for funding for 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil - including for sports, music and the arts.\nBut any extra teaching time, or longer school days, will now depend on getting further funding from the spending review.\nIn a statement, Sir Kevan said a \"sustained and comprehensive programme of support\" would be needed and that \"more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge\".\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"We are sad but not surprised that Sir Kevan Collins is standing down.\n\"We know that Sir Kevan had much bolder and broader plans but that these required substantially more investment than the government was willing to provide.\n\"He's tried his hardest on behalf of children and young people, but, in the final analysis, the political will just wasn't there to support him.\"\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the resignation was a \"damning indictment of the Conservatives' education catch-up plan\".\n\"He was brought in by Boris Johnson because of his experience and expertise in education, but the government have thrown out his ideas as soon as it came to stumping up the money needed to deliver them.\"\nBefore taking up his post as tsar, Sir Kevan was head of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which examines evidence for what works in education.\nAs EEF chief executive, he ran an organisation that examined ideas for raising achievement, with the aim of breaking the link between deprivation and poor outcomes in school.\nSir Kevan has had a long career in education, as a former teacher who went on to be the director of children's services and chief executive of Tower Hamlets, east London."

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "This is the first day the UK government has formally announced zero coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began.\nIt sounds like a milestone worth celebrating and something we have all been waiting for - even as the variant first identified in India (now dubbed the Delta variant by the World Health Organization) spreads across the UK. \nBut if there is one thing we have learned about tracking coronavirus, it is that any figures that accompany it come with caveats. \nReports of daily deaths are often lower at weekends and at the start of the week because less counting takes place while statisticians are off - and adding in Monday's bank holiday will make this figure still less certain.\nJust because no deaths were announced on 1 June does not mean for certain that no deaths actually occurred. Often the figures are revised once death certificates are examined for precise details of date of death.\nBut the situation has been transformed since the height of the second wave of the pandemic, when daily deaths were measured in four figures.\nIn the last three months, death rates, the numbers of people being admitted to hospital and catching the virus have all gone steadily in the right direction - down. And add to that the increasing numbers of people getting their first and second doses of vaccines. \nAt the beginning of the year, the UK was in a very different place. We saw the devastating peak of the second wave, fuelled by the more transmissible Kent variant.\nIn the first week of January, for example, the average number of people who had had a positive coronavirus test stood at about 59,660 (this figure takes into account the daily average over a period of seven days). This compares with 2,270 in early May.\nThe picture in the UK's hospitals was similar. In mid-January there were some 38,411 patients with confirmed Covid-19 in hospital. By mid-May the figure was around 1,200. \nNow, for the first time since September, that number has dipped below a thousand. \nBut make no mistake, that is a lot of people in hospital, some on ventilators. Sadly, not everyone will survive.\nAnd in some parts of the UK the \"Delta\" variant from India is driving hospital admissions back up again.  \nWhen it comes to lives lost, in mid-January the average for people who had had a positive coronavirus test and died within 28 days of this test was 1,248.\nCompare that with the daily average in early May when just 12 deaths were reported. It is a big decline. \nLockdowns, vaccinations, an improved understanding of coronavirus and better treatments have all helped bring down these numbers. \nBut as ever, there still needs to be a note of caution. \nIn the second wave of England's epidemic in the autumn and early winter, schoolchildren and young adults experienced a much faster rise in infections than other age groups - most likely because they had more opportunities to mingle.\nMany under-50s are yet to have their jabs, with vaccination rates among people from ethnic minorities lagging behind the average. \nThe easing of lockdown may have an impact on infection rates, and we are still awaiting a definitive assessment of the impact of schools reopening. \nAnd then there are emerging variants to contend with, including the Indian variant which has been causing spikes of infection in some areas. \nScientists advising the UK government believe it does spread more easily, although early data suggests vaccines remain effective after two doses. \nThe questions that experts will be trying to answer is whether they have got the balance of measures right and have put them in place at the right time to prevent things from getting out of control. \nIn fact, if we look solely at the current definition of \"coronavirus deaths\", there has been a moment a bit like this before - a day with zero deaths recorded at the end of July.\nBut at the time, the government in England was using a different definition (which counted any death after a positive test) and reported 38 of those deaths on that day.\nAll these deaths had happened more than 28 days after a positive test, so they are not counted by today's definition of a coronavirus death which occurs within 28 days of a positive test.  \nSo if you go back and look at those July figures now, that was the first \"zero deaths\" day.\nIt just goes to show we cannot pin our hopes on a single figure or a single day. It might say \"zero deaths\" by the government's tally today, but that does not mean zero caution.\nThe ultimate message is things are getting better but it is not over yet. "

He confessed to stabbing Ms White, 20, with a knife following a row over \u00a330.\nThe document said: \"After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in custody, and the other evidence presented in the dossier, the panel was not satisfied that Mr Gafoor was suitable for release.\n\"However, on assessing the benefits and risks of Mr Gafoor remaining in open conditions, the panel recommended that he should do so.\n\"He had made considerable efforts to address his areas of risk and had demonstrated steady progress.\n\"Mr Gafoor will be eligible for another parole review in due course.\"\nThe review was told the probation service had yet to \"fully develop\" a release plan for Gafoor, but would likely involve him living in supported accommodation, with strict limits placed on his movements, contacts and activities.\n\"The panel concluded this outline plan was not ready to manage Mr Gafoor in the community at this stage,\" they said.\nIt was only after advances in DNA technology that Gafoor was caught, 15 years after Ms White was stabbed more than 50 times at her docklands flat in Cardiff.\nThe hearing was told that Gafoor's risk factors at the time of the murder included a \"loss of control when angry or feeling under threat\" and there were concerns about his emotional wellbeing.\nWhile in prison, Gafoor had undertaken accredited programmes to address his \"decision-making, better ways of thinking and tendency to use violence\".\nAt his sentencing, prosecutor Patrick Harrington QC told the court: \"He did not simply kill, he attacked in a barbaric manner, cutting, stabbing and slashing his victim over 50 times, cutting her throat, slashing both wrists, cutting, stabbing and slashing her face, arm and especially the torso.\n\"It is tempting to talk of the defendant having attacked in a frenzy, but the pattern of distribution of injuries suggests a particular mindset.\"\nMs White's murder originally resulted in three innocent men being jailed in 1990 before their convictions were quashed on appeal in 1992.\nA reopening of the case led police to Gafoor 11 years later.\nA \u00a330m investigation, Britain's biggest police corruption probe, was launched into whether 13 South Wales Police officers perverted the course of justice in manipulating evidence, but in 2011, a trial of eight officers collapsed when documents went missing."

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 20 healthcare organisations, including those representing nurses, doctors, surgeons and therapists, are calling for stricter UK guidelines to be introduced on face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nIn a virtual meeting with officials, they will say existing rules leave them vulnerable to infection through the air, especially by new Covid variants.\nThe unprecedented appeal will see them argue that other countries, such as the United States, protect their health workers with higher-grade equipment.\nIt is thought to be the first time health and care organisations have united on a single issue in this way - a sign of the desperation many feel about the need for staff to be kept safe.\nThe delegation will include representatives of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and many other professional organisations and unions.\nOn the government side will be about 20 of the most senior officials from all four UK nations, many involved in setting the guidelines on personal protective equipment (PPE). \nWith an estimated 1,000 health and care workers killed by Covid in the UK, the plea is for the risks of airborne transmission to be recognised in hospitals and other care settings.\nThat means all staff caring for Covid patients being issued with masks specifically designed to guard against infectious aerosols. \nThe US government is among many that require health workers to wear what are called N95 respirators - widely judged to be more effective than the standard-issue surgical masks mandated in the UK. \n\"It is the inconsistency that is getting beyond a joke,\" according to Dr Barry Jones, a leading figure in the campaign, who will be presenting evidence at the meeting. \nHe and his colleagues in the nutritional care association BAPEN first raised their concerns with Public Health England as far back as April last year. \nThey objected to the strict guidance that means that only certain procedures considered likely to generate aerosols entitle staff to a high standard of mask known as an FFP3. \nThey say there is a growing body of research highlighting how other processes - including simply breathing and coughing - can produce far more aerosols than those on the official list. \n\"If a patient is breathing 12 times a minute and you're providing close quarters care for them for 15 minutes or more, then the chances are you will get a large dose of the virus if you are just in a surgical mask,\" Dr Jones told me.\n\"If the present guidelines were effective, why have we had such a high death rate among the public, and health and care staff?\"\nOne objection to the higher grade FFP3 or N95 masks is that they cost far more than the thinner surgical ones. \nBut trainee surgeon and researcher Dr Gillian Higgins, who will also be addressing the meeting, believes she has an answer. \nShe and her colleagues have set up a charity, MedSupplyDrive UK, that has donated 500,000 items of PPE to hospitals, and also researched ways to make the use of FFP3 masks cheaper. \nIn discussions with manufacturers, they have found several options for reusable FFP3 masks. \nShe says these would have a better fit than existing models, could be made in the UK, and would work out at far lower cost over the course of a year. \nDr Higgins says: \"It is not pie in the sky, we have worked out how to do this, and we have just got to get on with it.\"  \nShe also points out that distributing these devices widely would end the \"postcode lottery\" of which health and care workers get better protected.\nAt least 17 hospital and ambulance trusts have already decided to break with official guidance by equipping their staff with FFP3 masks, but the majority have not.\nAccording to Kamini Gadhok, chief executive of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the hope is to work constructively towards a solution. \nShe is concerned that recently updated guidance issued by Public Health England, which allows staff to perform their own risk assessment to decide on PPE, \"isn't strong enough\".\n\"It is not rocket science, we know the virus is airborne, we know surgical masks don't protect you from airborne viruses, and we're still in a dangerous situation with new variants. So why not apply a precautionary approach?\n\"What we are asking for is about saving lives - so why not do it?\"\nFor Tracy Nicholls, chief executive of the College of Paramedics, the meeting is about trying to avoid more losses. \nSo far 30 paramedics and ambulance crew have been killed by Covid, and the big fear is having to care for a Covid patient in the back of an ambulance with only a surgical mask for protection. \n\"What is really important is rebuilding trust and confidence in the guidance because we know from surveys that that has been lost,\" she said.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the safety of staff is a \"top priority\", adding that the PPE recommendations are based on the latest clinical evidence.\nA spokesperson said: \"Emerging evidence and data are continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance will be amended accordingly if needed.\""

      "text": "The Department of Education needs to spend more than \u00a3180m on widespread measures to tackle educational underachievement over the next five years. \nAll children should also go to pre-school for at least four and a half hours a day.\nThere needs to be significantly more investment in early years education.\nThose are some of the actions recommended in a wide-ranging report, called A Fair Start.\nThe report, from an expert panel set up by the Education Minister Peter Weir in 2020, looks into the links between persistent educational underachievement and socio-economic background.\nThe research had been a commitment in the New Decade New Approach (NDNA) agreement.\nMr Weir described it as \"one of the most important reports I have overseen in my time as education minister\".\nThe panel was expected to look particularly at the \"long-standing issues facing working class Protestant boys\" and come up with an action plan to tackle underachievement. \nHowever, the Fair Start report said underachievement affected all communities and \"the most significant differences are between the GCSE attainment of free school meal-entitled (FMSE) and non-FSME pupils, irrespective of religion, gender or ethnicity\".\nBut it recommended a number of actions to help boys, who it said could face alienation from school, a lack of role models and lack a sense of belonging.\nIt called, for instance, for more investment in youth work in Protestant working class areas and said schools in disadvantaged areas should to be funded to run more extra-curricular activities. \nThe report also said more male teachers were needed, especially in primary schools.\n\"For a number of years, the issue of educational underachievement has been an area that I have been personally committed to addressing so this is a very significant day for me,\" said the education minister.\n\"I concur with the panel that the actions set out in the Action Plan are capable of making a real and significant impact on children's learning.\n\"We need to give our young people confidence, instil within them self-belief that they can succeed and provide the support they need to thrive in school.\"\nMr Weir added that the \"crucial work\" of the panel provides a \"road map\" for how we can achieve all these things.\nSetting up the panel in 2020, Mr Weir said underachievement by some pupils remained \"entrenched\" in Northern Ireland despite significant funding and policies to tackle it.\nThe Northern Ireland Audit Office, however, previously said the Department of Education (DE) could not demonstrate that almost \u00a31bn funding to help disadvantaged children had made a difference.\nA previous large-scale report for the Executive Office examining the effects of deprivation on educational achievement published in 2017 was critical of academic selection.\nThe expert panel said there was evidence preparation for the transfer test \"skews\" teaching in the later years of primary school.\n\"Transfer outcomes for free school meal-entitled (FSME) pupils are significantly lower than for non-FSME pupils, leading to significantly lower percentages of FSME pupils attending grammar schools,\" the report said.\nThe panel said the arrangements for transfer between primary and post-primary schools should be reviewed by DE. \nThey also said there needed to be much more focus on children's education from birth.\n\"There is a substantial body of research evidence which highlights that children's early experiences have a profound and lasting impact on their future learning and development,\" the report said, \"which confirms that investing in quality early childhood education for disadvantaged children has significant and long-term benefits for individuals and society.\" \nOne of their recommendations is that all children attend full-time pre-school for at least four and a half hours a day.\nThey said research suggested children who attended pre-school full-time had better \"literacy, language, maths, socio-emotional development and physical health, had increased school readiness skills\". \nThe report said, though, staff in pre-school and early years \"were struggling to cope with the number of children who had special educational needs or, more commonly, were awaiting assessment to confirm special educational needs\".\nThe panel also called for more investment in children's emotional and mental wellbeing to reflect the level of need.\nThey also said the Covid-19 pandemic and children being out of school for prolonged periods was likely to have \"exacerbated the existing challenges faced by many children and young people\".\nBBC News NI has previously reported on significant waiting times for Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), for example.\nOther areas covered by the panel's extensive report included the need for more links between schools and local communities and more professional development for school staff.\nThe panel recommended 47 actions needed to address educational underachievement at all levels at a cumulative cost of over \u00a3180m over the next five years, though the report also recommends many of the actions continue beyond that.\nThe expert panel was chaired by Dr Noel Purdy from Stranmillis University College.\nOther members were former principal Kathleen O'Hare, the chief executive of the Greater Shankill Partnership Jackie Redpath, the head of Belfast Boys' Model Mary Montgomery and the head of Long Tower Primary School Joyce Logue.\nTheir final report is based on evidence from almost 350 school leaders, parents, officials from government departments, community organisations, assembly members, teaching unions and others."

But it's become a bit like trying to ride two horses at the same time that are going in two different directions.\"\nIn an often emotional address, Rev Carton said he had prayed and read, and studied the stories of Moses, Joshua, Jeremiah and David from the Old Testament.\n\"It's a call to leave the church of my birth, the church that I've grown up in,\" he said.\n\"What I hear is God calling me, calling me to those who certainly feel cast out, who feel rejected, who feel unloved.\n\"The decisions taken by our denomination mean that they can never belong.\"\nHe said God was telling him to be strong and courageous but he and his family had \"no idea what our next steps are going to be\".\nHe said being minister of Whitehead had been \"the great privilege of my life\".\nThe Presbyterian Church in Ireland said it was aware Rev Carton had indicated he would be seeking to leave his role.\n\"When that point comes, we would want to wish Ian well for the future and thank him for the service he has given, particularly to our congregation in Whitehead over these past years,\" a spokesperson said.\nIn 2019, following the decision taken by the general assembly in Belfast, the PCI dismissed an elder at Christ Church Sandymount for being in a same-sex marriage."

The lower part of the building would be used by the whole group as a communal meeting area.\nStefanie says the project needs people of all ages to work.\n\"It needs to be sustainable, like a forest. New and old growing together.\n\"We live in an overwhelming world, so we need people around us. We need strong community bonds.\" \nThe group behind the plans, Cohousing in Southern Scotland (Choiss), was formed in 2016 and has grown to include 20 people. They plan to sell their current properties and put their finances together to bid for the 19th Century mansion.\nDavid Somervell, a retired university sustainability advisor, is the secretary of the group. He stressed that the community would not be transient, so relationships could build over many years.\nThe 67-year-old said he and his wife were looking to live a less private, more convivial existence.\n\"We want to live somewhere where we can draw on each other's support when we want it,\" he said.\n\"Everyone would have a quiet space and a key for their own front door, but then they could also go to the communal areas to draw on the care and affections of others.\n\"It would give us a sense of belonging to have this support from others and for others.\"\nThe father-of-two said he saw people living in a \"harmonious\" way while studying architecture in Copenhagen in the 1980s.\n\"I have a sense that individuals in our society suffer great anomie, they feel abandoned and bereft of social contact and are lonely.\n\"It is unsatisfactory values which have been forced upon us which has lead to us living separately.\n\"This makes us more competitive when instead we should be showing more compassion to each other. Humans are social animals.\"\nJan Woolley, 71, is another member of the group. The single retired civil servant said she had a \"fantastic childhood\" living in a compound in Kenya.\n\"There was no structured play dates and we grew up as a group, which is how Comiston Farmhouse would work too.\n\"In a community like this you can see your friends whenever you want and you all help each other.\n\"You don't have to make arrangements to meet up, you just knock on each other's doors.\"\nThe grandmother-of-two lives on her own, and says: \"Currently I have a slight worry that if something was to happen to me, nobody would know for days.\n\"In this way of life we are proposing everyone would have an awareness of how people are and would help and check on each other.\"\nDr John Cant, 67, who lives alone in Edinburgh, spent 30 years living in France in a shared building.\nThe computer software engineer said: \"I became tired of the transient relationships between all the volunteers who came and went.\n\"I want to live in a community where strong relationships develop over time.\n\"I think humans are tribal, but the way most of us live now means we are becoming more polarised.\n\"We now have a lot of knowledge that there are benefits to being tribal, to living in an extended group rather than in nuclear families without support, and this is how I want to live.\"\nThey hope to mirror the feeling of wellbeing that Frances McDormand's character Fern finds when she becomes part of the tribe of nomads in the film Nomadland.\nComiston Farmhouse was laterly a residential support unit for teenagers until it closed in January 2015.\nThere had been plans for it to be sold to developers to be turned into housing, but the sale fell through following local opposition to the plans. The property has been put back on the market by City of Edinburgh Council for offers over \u00a31m.\nIf Choiss is successful, it would become the location for one of the first cohousing projects to get off the ground in Scotland.\nAn estimated 906,000 people live on their own in Scotland with more than a third of households being occupied by one person.\nProf Lynn Jamieson, professor of sociology at Edinburgh University, said: \"Creating such a community through cohousing is a good idea.\n\"There have been times when communities were more stable and interconnected, such as in mining villages.\n\"I think because they plan to be intergenerational they have a good chance.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Jason Leitch,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland is at the beginning of a third wave of Covid, according to the country's national clinical director. \nProf Jason Leitch said more cases were inevitable as society gradually opens up after lockdown. \nOn Monday a scientific adviser to the UK government warned there were signs the UK was in the early stages of a third wave of infections.\nEarlier Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, paused lockdown easing in some areas of the country. \nMost of the country had been due to drop to level one of the five-tier system next week but Ms Sturgeon said 13 council areas would stay in level two due to rising case rates. \nGlasgow, which had been the only local authority still in level three, will also move to level two. \nAs national clinical director, Prof Leitch regularly appears alongside Ms Sturgeon at Covid briefings to help communicate public health messages. \nHe was asked on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime if he thought Scotland was at the start of a third wave.\nHe replied: \"Yes. I think we are. The question is how big that third wave is.\"\nCovid cases hit a low on 5 May, when 85 cases were recorded across Scotland. \nBut since then numbers have been rising, with 641 recorded on Friday - the highest daily number since 25 March.\nThe variant first identified in India is believed to be responsible for about half of Scotland's daily cases. \nProf Leitch said that as restrictions ease then it followed that there would be more cases.\nHe added: \"The question is whether you control that to a level that doesn't cause enough severe disease to fill hospitals and enough severe disease to cause misery and death to families.\n\"And that's the balance we are now trying to strike in the advice we are giving and the decisions the first minister and the cabinet have made.\"\nProf Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, told BBC Good Morning Scotland she was encouraged that the UK reported zero Covid deaths on Tuesday, the first single day when this has happened since the pandemic began. \nShe said: \"It's incredibly good news and it shows the progress we have made in the past year. Vaccines are stopping severe disease, they are stopping hospitalisations and deaths. \n\"We want to buy a few more weeks to get more of these vaccines in people's arms, this is not going backwards - the end is still in sight.\"\nProf Sridhar added that the relaxing of overseas travel restrictions was \"creating uncertainty\" for how quickly the pandemic will be defeated. \nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf told Good Morning Scotland that slowing down the relaxation of lockdown was a \"bump in the road\" and that the situation would be reviewed on a weekly basis.\nHe said: \"Crucially what we are looking at, in what is likely to be the third wave, is the effect the vaccine has had, how many people are going into hospital, how long they are staying there. \n\"Please bear in mind if it is the start of the third wave then we are not at the peak.\"\nHowever, Mr Yousaf said there were encouraging signs that the link between positive cases and hospitalisations is weakening.\nProf Leitch was also asked if Glasgow's role as a host city of Euro 2020 had any bearing on the decision to ease restrictions before the tournament starts on 11 June.\nThe Scottish government has given approval for 12,000 supporters - 25% of the stadium's capacity - to attend tournament matches at Hampden in June. \nHe said: \"Absolutely not. There is no single sector, despite what you might believe, there is no single sector that gets to control the Covid response.\n\"I absolutely promise you. Not in the advice and not in the decision-making.\"\nMeanwhile, Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, a virologist at the University of Edinburgh, later told BBC Scotland's The Nine there has been a \"bump\" in hospitalisation numbers. \nBut she added 5% of people who test positive now require hospital treatment - compared to 10% earlier in the pandemic - and patients are spending less time in hospital.\n\"It tells us that not only is the vaccination working but also treatments have made progress significantly since even the beginning of the year,\"Dr Tait-Burkard said. \nScotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the vaccine gave \"a huge amount of security\".\nBut he added: \"We are not certain yet that the vaccination protects us from the significant upsurge in hospitalisation, which would obviously be a real worry as part of the development of the pandemic.\"\nMr Swinney, who is also the Covid recovery secretary, added: \"The vaccination is a real strength but there are still dangers and we have to make sure that we take a measured approach to tackle all of those issue as we address the pace of the virus within our society.\""

      "text": "Consumers could face more expensive shopping bills in the autumn as costs climb and Brexit red tape increases.\nShops prices will be under pressure from high food, shipping, and commodity costs, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned.\nHowever, in May retail prices declined as clothing and footwear prices fell, it said.\nThe government said it was supporting businesses and the lowest paid.\nCost pressures are building for retailers, the BRC said, as global food prices hit their highest for seven years.\nMeanwhile shipping costs have risen threefold since 2019, and commodity prices are climbing.\n\"Retailers may be forced to pass on some costs onto their customers,\" said BRC chief Helen Dickinson.\n\"We will likely see the costs filter through in the second half of this year,\" she said.\nShe called on the government to help to ease the burden on consumers by finding ways to minimise the impact of new checks and documentation required at EU borders from October.\nIn May consumers had another month of falling shop prices, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index.\nBut while clothing and footwear prices continued to fall, the pick-up in demand once lockdown restrictions were lifted meant the drop was smaller than in previous months.\nMeanwhile, furniture and electricals saw prices rise as retailers felt the lingering impact of disruption to global supply chains earlier this year.\nShop prices fell 0.6% year-on-year, but the decline was at the slowest rate since February 2020, and below the 12 and six-month average price decreases of 1.7% and 1.8% respectively.\nSupermarkets battling to maintain market share by keeping prices low, left food prices to fall for a second consecutive month in May, but only by 0.3% compared 0.6% deflation in April.\nFresh food prices fell for the sixth consecutive month in May, although deflation slowed to 1% in May from 1.5% in April.\n\"With high street retailers continuing to offer price reductions and supermarkets promoting seasonal food and drink, this is helping to offset cost-of-living increases,\" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ.\n\"Consumers will be seeing the impact of higher energy and fuel costs in household bills and while some cost price increases are coming through the supply chain, this is not yet enough for shop price inflation to return.\"\nThe government said it was \"absolutely committed to price stability\".\nThe spokesperson added: \"We continue to take action to support living standards and the lowest paid.\n\"The furlough and self employed support schemes have protected jobs and incomes throughout the pandemic and the increase to the National Living Wage in April this year is providing an annual pay rise of almost \u00a3350 for a full-time worker earning the National Living Wage. \n\"We're supporting businesses as they adjust to our new trading relationship, and engaging regularly to ensure businesses can trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities.\""
