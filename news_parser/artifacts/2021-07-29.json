      "tags": "Sussex Police",
      "text": "The father of a murdered schoolboy has criticised police for scrapping plans to hold a public appeal for information 40 years after his son disappeared.\nVishal Mehrotra, eight, was last seen alive in July 1981. His partial remains were found in a West Sussex woodland. \nSussex Police had initially asked his father Vishambar to support an anniversary appeal.\nThe force later decided not to go ahead \"in the absence of any new or currently viable lines of inquiry\".\nMr Mehrotra said the decision was \"disgusting\".\n\"When this is their attitude, how the hell are they going to be able to find any evidence to find Vishal's murderer,\" he asked.\nLast year, a detective wrote to Mr Mehrotra and said they would work together to ensure the appeal was widely promoted.\nThe detective wrote: \"I honestly believe that someone out there knows what happened and will provide us with the evidence that can support a prosecution and give you the truth.\"\nIn June, Mr Mehrotra claimed Sussex Police failed to solve the case because of institutional racism - an allegation the force \"firmly refutes\".\nVishal disappeared on 29 July 1981 as his family returned to their home in Putney, south-west London, having earlier joined celebrations for the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.\nPartial remains were found in Alder Copse in West Sussex seven months later. The lower half of his body has never been recovered.\nNo-one has ever been brought to justice. \nMr Mehrotra said: \"Probably way back had [the police] done their job properly they may well have had the murderer in their hands by now.\"\n\"They have been looking into it for 40 years and so far they have got absolutely nothing to offer me,\" he added.\nShaun Keep, a former Met police cold case detective, said the decision not to hold a public appeal was a \"massive missed opportunity\".\nA \"spark of new information\" could help progress the investigation, he said. \n\"I think the passage of time can help in difficult investigations,\" he said. \"Allegiances change, friendships change, loyalties change, fear and intimidation may subside over time.\"\nSussex Police said Vishal's murder remained an \"open and unresolved investigation\".\nThe force said: \"Even after nearly 40 years, we will continue to take any opportunity to pursue any new lines of inquiry that might lead to justice being obtained for Vishal and his family.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "title": "NHS Covid-19 app pings rise by over 70,000 to new record",
      "tags": "Contact tracing,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of self-isolation alerts sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales has risen to a new record of 689,313 in the week up to 21 July. \nThe figures represent an increase of over 70,000 compared with the previous week.\nBut the rate of increase was lower than the previous week, rising by 11% compared to 17%.\nIf you are \"pinged\" by the app you are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nHowever the government has said it is crucial for people to do so.\nIn recent weeks, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption.\nIt led to the government allowing some key workers - such as those working in food distribution - to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests.\nThere are currently 260 testing sites open for these workers, Downing Street said on Thursday - and they are working to set up another 800. After that, 1,200 more sites will be opened \"over the coming days\".\nFrom 16 August, all fully-vaccinated people will not need to self-isolate if pinged by the app, although they will be encouraged to book a Covid PCR test.\nThe impact on businesses has resulted in calls for the 16 August deadline to be brought forward.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is asking for urgent assistance to exempt staff pinged by the NHS Covid app saying pings are affecting production.\nMany in the hospitality industry also complained of shortages as staff had to self-isolate. Some bar staff have told the BBC that they've lost a lot of money by missing shifts, while others say they have been told to delete the app by their manager.\nThe app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the NHS Test and Trace team.\nLatest data from Test and Trace shows that 14% of cases transferred to contact-tracers in the week to 21 July were not reached and so were unable to provide details of close contacts. \nThis is the highest proportion of people not reached since October last year.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam said separate figures from Public Health England showed the vaccines have now prevented 22 million Covid cases and 60,000 deaths. He added it was \"truly massive\".\nIf you were looking for evidence that the \"pingdemic\" is over you will struggle to find it in these statistics. The figure of nearly 690,000 contact tracing alerts - or pings - is a new record, up 11% on the previous week. They were triggered by nearly 148,000 positive test results entered in the app, up 25%.\nDespite the anecdotal evidence of people switching off or getting rid of the app, there is no sign yet of mass deletions.\nBut there are a few straws in the wind suggesting things might be changing. The rate of increase in pings slowed, and the number of alerts triggered by each positive test result was down. That suggests that people who later became infected had fewer close contacts - either because they were socialising less or because those they encountered did not have the app.\nIn the week when restrictions in England were relaxed so that venues did not need to record visitors' details, check-ins via the app were sharply lower.\nAs they find they don't need it to check in, more people may decide the app is more trouble than it's worth.\nBut the team which designed it believes the NHS Covid-19 app is changing behaviour in useful ways - even if someone ignores a ping's instruction to self isolate they may become more cautious, and anyone who has a holiday planned may be nudged into staying at home for a few days beforehand rather than having their plans spoiled by an alert.\nAt first, it was criticised for being ineffective, in recent weeks it's been accused of disrupting thousands of businesses, but its designers believe this experimental technology is finally proving that it can be a useful weapon in controlling the pandemic.\nAfter a week of falling cases the number of people testing positive for coronavirus rose on Wednesday, when 27,734 new daily cases were reported.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"The truth is, when it comes to case numbers no one really knows where they are going to go next\".\nPeople in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own).\nIf you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes.\nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nSeparately to the NHS Covid app, there have also been changes to the NHS app, which among other things is used for Covid vaccination records.\nIt has been updated to allow iPhone and iPad users to store their Covid Pass using the Apple Wallet app.\nThis can be used at events and venues in England, but not for international travel the government says."

      "text": "Netflix is set to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for key cast and crew on US TV and film productions.\nAccording to reports, the US streaming company will require that \"zone A\" personnel - actors and crew in close contact with them - must get the jab.\nIt is understood Netflix is considering a implementing similar policy in the UK. \nOther firms such as Google have said workers must get vaccinated before returning to the office. \nThe policy will begin at Google's US campuses and then be rolled out globally for its 144,000 employees.\nNetflix has implemented the move after new standards were recently agreed between Hollywood unions and studios that would allow companies to implement mandatory vaccination policies for key cast members and crew. \nHowever, the actor Sean Penn wants the policy extended for all members of production, not just those classed as \"zone A\". \nHe recently said that he would not return to work on the drama Gaslit, which is backed by the studio NBC Universal, unless all cast and crew receive the jab. \nNetflix is making the move after the US Disease Control and Prevention announced earlier this week that masks will once again have to be worn indoors even by people who have been fully vaccinated.\nIt follows a spike in Covid cases due to the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.\nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a blog post that \"anyone coming to work on our campuses will need to be vaccinated\".\nHow the policy is implemented \"will vary according to local conditions and regulations, and will not apply until vaccines are widely available in your area\", he said.\nIn addition, Google will extend the full reopening of its global campuses from 1 September to 18 October due to a spike in cases caused by the Delta variant of coronavirus.\nPeople in special circumstances can apply to work from home until the end of 2021.\nHowever, any Google employee can apply to work from home permanently if they choose, and transfer offices.\nGoogle expects that over time in any given week, 60% of employees will work in the office for a few days each week, one-fifth will be working in new office locations and another fifth will be working from home.\nMany firms are weighing up the pros and cons of letting their workforce continue to work from home.\nOthers have also specified that workers coming into the office need to be vaccinated.\nIn June, Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury said staff must have vaccinations ahead of their return to the workplace.\n\"The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous,\" it said.\nIn the US, JP Morgan said in June that it would instruct staff to log their vaccination status on an internal web portal, with fully-jabbed employees being allowed to discard face masks at work.\nGoldman Sachs bankers also have to disclose how many jabs they have had before returning to the office."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  \nAbout 60,000 deaths have been prevented in England as a result of the Covid vaccine programme, according to analysis by Public Health England. Announcing the data as a \"truly massive success\", Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said an estimated 22 million cases had also been avoided. He said the chances of another lockdown will be \"much lower\" if a higher proportion of the population, including 18-25-year-olds, get their jabs. But he said it was quite possible to have \"one or two bumpy periods in the autumn and in the winter, not only through Covid, but also through flu and other respiratory viruses as well\".\nThe number of self-isolation alerts sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales has risen to a new record of 689,313 in the week up to 21 July. That's an increase of more than 70,000 compared with the previous week. If you are \"pinged\" by the app you are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. No 10 said it appreciated the impact of the so-called \"pingdemic\" and said there were 260 testing sites open to allow pinged critical workers avoid isolation. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was working to set up another 800 and after that, 1,200 more sites would be opened \"over the coming days\".\nThe number of people on furlough has fallen sharply with young people moving off the government scheme fastest, new figures show. At the end of June, 1.9 million people were still on furlough compared to the peak at nearly nine million in May last year. In the last three months, younger people came off furlough twice as fast as all other age brackets. Almost 600,000 under-25s had left the scheme in that time, the Treasury said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the government's policies were working. The wage support scheme will end on 30 September and while some have called it a \"godsend\", others fear redundancies when it stops.\nUniversity students will get \"advance warning\" if they are required to have a Covid vaccine before moving to halls of residence, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. The government has already announced people will need two jabs to enter nightclubs and other crowded events from September. And the decision on making vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - will be taken in the same month, Mr Raab said. Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The National Union of Students called the idea \"appalling\".\nTwo sisters who graduated from medical school at the same time and started working in the same hospital on the same day have told the BBC how they helped each other through the Covid-19 pandemic. Caitl\u00edn Prosser, 24, and Megan Prosser, 23, have been working in hospitals for three years. Last week, the pair from South Brent in Devon started new jobs together at Southmead Hospital. Megan gave vaccinations and Caitlin said she felt \"really lucky\" to do the job with her sister and to share closeness, a similar outlook and trust.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you've been pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app here's our guide on what you need to do.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "A former Paralympian who glued himself to the roof of a plane has been found guilty of causing a public nuisance. \nJames Brown, who is visually impaired, climbed on to the British Airways plane at London City Airport in October 2019, during Extinction Rebellion protests.\nThe 56-year-old from Exeter glued his right hand to the Amsterdam-bound plane, wedging his phone in the door to stop it from closing.\nJudge Gregory Perrins will sentence the double gold medallist on 17 September. \nNorthern Ireland-born Brown, who represented Great Britain in cycling and athletics before competing for Ireland in cross-country skiing, spent an hour on the aircraft before he was removed, Southwark Crown Court heard.\nProsecutors said he caused disruption to more than 300 British Airways passengers, costing the airline \u00a340,000.\nBrown, who represented himself, denied one count of causing a public nuisance, claiming he had \"to do something spectacular\" to draw attention to the climate crisis.\nBut he was found guilty on Wednesday after a jury deliberated for less than an hour.\nSpeaking after the verdict, Brown said he was \"gutted\" but that it was \"the price you pay for taking a risk\". \nHe said: \"I guess it could've gone the other way. I knew that a conviction was a possibility, of course, I knew that.\n\"What I did was only a very small part. There are a lot of people giving up a lot to make a difference and I'm only one of them.\"\nThe jury heard that Brown had booked his flight on the morning of the stunt, and had been offered assistance with boarding due to his disability.\nHe had a bottle of superglue in his luggage that had not been detected by security, prosecutor Richard Witcombe said.\nBrown declined an offer by a member of cabin staff to help him to his seat, telling her that he was going to climb on to the roof of the plane.\nGiving evidence, Brown wept as he told jurors: \"I was prepared to challenge myself, to be scared, to face the fear, because the fear of climate ecological breakdown is so much greater.\"\nIn an emotional speech, married father-of-four Brown, who runs a charity, said: \"My protest, the purpose I hope is clear, my motivation was to maximise media attention to the climate crisis, which back at that time was hardly receiving any.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pregnancy",
      "text": "England's chief midwife has stepped up her call for pregnant women to get the Covid jab as soon as possible. \nEstimates based on GP records and Public Health England data suggest hundreds of thousands have not had the jab, as the number of mums-to-be in hospital with the virus rises.\nOther data suggests the Delta variant increases the chance of severe disease.\nIn the last three months, 171 pregnant women with Covid needed hospital care - but none had had both jabs. \nIn a letter to midwives, obstetricians and GP practices, chief midwife for England Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent says all healthcare professionals have \"a responsibility to proactively encourage pregnant women\" to get vaccinated. \nShe recommends advice on jabs be offered at every opportunity.\n\"Vaccines save lives, and this is another stark reminder that the Covid-19 jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones, safe and out of hospital,\" the chief midwife told pregnant women.\nSince mid-April 2021, mothers-to-be have been offered the Pfizer or Moderna coronavirus jab, with the second dose recommended eight weeks after the first. \nPublic Health England data suggests about 51,724 pregnant women have received one Covid vaccine in England so far. Of these, around 20,648 have had their second dose. \nThis is out of approximately 606,500 pregnant women in England in 2020-21, based on estimates from GP records.\nWhile uncommon, severe illness with Covid-19 is more likely in later pregnancy.\nUK Obstetric Surveillance data looking at pregnant women admitted to English hospitals up to July shows:\nYvonne O'Connor, who is 36 weeks pregnant and attending an antenatal clinic at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, said she started getting worried about Covid in her third trimester.\n\"Luckily, I haven't had Covid at all,\" she said. \"I've been very lucky that way. \n\"But I just thought it was important to have it [the vaccine] to protect me and the baby now as well. So I decided to do it.\"\nAt the same clinic, mum-to-be Amy Weir, 29, said she had discussed the risks and benefits of the vaccine with her midwife.\n\"I decided that... I was in a better position having the vaccine than I was potentially being exposed to the risk of Covid,\" she said.  \nVictoria Rawlings, whose baby is due in November, said she was \"really nervous\" before having the her first jab.\n\"And then I did a bit more reading and thought, actually, this is perfect,\" she said. \"And I feel much safer, much happier, much freer to go out and about.\"\nBut it's not been a straightforward decision for everyone. \nIona Debarge, who is 30 weeks pregnant, said she was nervous because the vaccine was still very new.\n\"I think if it had been going for five years or something like that, I would feel more confident to get it done. That's why I'm still hesitating.\" \nLead researcher Prof Marian Knight, from Oxford University, said she was very concerned about the recent rise in pregnant women in hospital with the disease - though numbers are not as high as those seen during earlier peaks in the pandemic. \nShe said that during the winter wave, when the Alpha variant was dominant, one in 10 pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid symptoms required intensive care - but now, with the Delta variant dominant, she said that figure was one in seven.\nProf Knight told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that pregnant women could be confident about having the vaccine, with the study showing it was \"very protective\" with no concerns over safety.\n\"Pregnant women were obviously naturally hesitant because there wasn't any evidence, but women can be reassured now because we have this real world evidence about the vaccine being used in practice,\" she said.\nShe added that by getting the vaccine, pregnant women would be protecting themselves and also passing protective antibodies onto their babies.\nAccording to NHS England, more than 55,000 pregnant women across the UK have received at least one dose of the vaccine, with no safety concerns. \nDr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said doctors were seeing very sick pregnant women with Covid-19 in hospital every day, with most being unvaccinated. \nHe added: \"One dose of Covid-19 vaccination gives good protection against infection, so the sooner you can book your first appointment the better. \n\"You can have your second dose eight weeks after your first, which will provide a good level of immunity against the Delta variant.\"\nDr Sarah McMullen, of the National Childbirth Trust, said she was \"extremely concerned\" that many pregnant women remain unvaccinated and vulnerable, and strongly encouraged women to consider having the jab\nShe added: \"It is understandable that pregnant women have questions and hesitations about vaccinations and they need to be able to trust in the information and support to make an informed decision. \n\"We've been really frustrated to hear of so much misinformation and the confusion this has caused.\" "

      "tags": "Tourism,Cruise ships,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "International cruises will be able to start again from England from 2 August after a 16-month break.\nPeople arriving at UK ports who have been fully vaccinated in the US and the EU will also not have to quarantine, the UK government said.\nIt is part of a plan to relax isolation rules for US and EU arrivals in the UK.\nAn industry body said travel agencies, hotels, tour guides, port operators and other firms would benefit from cruises restarting.\nDomestic cruises have been allowed to run from May but international cruises have been prohibited.\nThe government said international cruise travel advice \"will be amended to encourage travellers to understand the risks associated with cruise travel and take personal responsibility for their own safety abroad\".\nUnder the new rules, from 04:00 BST on Monday of next week, 2 August, fully vaccinated US and EU travellers arriving from amber countries will not need to quarantine or take a test on day eight of their arrival.\nHowever, they will still need to take a pre-departure test and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive.\nArrivals will also still need to complete a passenger locator form. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age.\nSeparate rules will continue to apply for those arriving from France. Travellers who have been in France in the 10 days before arriving in England must quarantine for 10 days after arrival, and take a Covid test on or before day two and on or after day eight, even if fully vaccinated.\nThe UK government said the overall rule changes would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the reopening of travel was \"progress we can all enjoy\".\nHowever, international cruises are unlikely to be available from Monday.\nOn its website, P&O Cruises said following their UK summer staycations, its Britannia ship will begin planned western Mediterranean itineraries on 25 September, while its Iona vessel will launch on the same date.\nIt said due to the current traffic light system, a \"number of itineraries have had to be cancelled\".\nCruises on Ventura have been paused until 3 October 2021, while cruises on its Azura ship have been halted up until 10 December 2021. Some others have been delayed until 2022.\nCunard's first UK cruise will sail on 13 August with international cruises beginning in October.\nBoth firms are part of US giant Carnival cruises, which is one of the world's biggest cruise companies.\nThe hugely profitable business was brought to its knees by Covid after regulators around the world stopped ships from sailing to try and limit outbreaks.\nThere were outbreaks on various cruise liners, including some owned by Carnival.\nRichard Ballantyne, chief executive at the British Ports Association (BPA), said UK domestic cruises had demonstrated how ports and cruise lines could \"ensure the health and safety of passengers, crew and destinations\".\nHe said the organisation is \"hopeful that the devolved administrations will follow suit shortly\" in allowing international cruises.\nThe British Ports Association, which represents more than 400 ports, terminal operators and port facilities, said it was \"disappointed\" that arrivals from France still need to quarantine on arrival into England for ten days.\nThe global cruise line industry has been one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn 2019, it contributed more than $154bn (\u00a3110bn) to the global economy, according to the trade body Cruise Lines International Association, before the shops were all anchored due to the lockdown.\nCarnival, which made a profit of $3bn in 2019, reported a loss of $10bn in 2020 after its revenues plunged 73%.\nThere is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on ships due to passengers and crew mixing from different parts of the world, according to experts.\nIn 2020 there were major outbreaks on cruise ships, including the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess.\nAccording to the most recent statistics on data site Worldometer, 22 countries have still had fewer Covid cases than were found on the Diamond Princess, and 27 countries have had fewer than its 13 deaths."

      "tags": "Television,Doctor Who",
      "text": "Jodie Whittaker is to step down from the lead role in Doctor Who, the BBC has confirmed.\nThe first woman to play the Time Lord will bow out in Autumn 2022, along with showrunner Chris Chibnall.\nWhittaker will star in a new six-part series later this year, and three specials next year, before she exits.\nIn a statement, Whittaker paid tribute to Chibnall and the Doctor Who team, adding: \"I will carry the Doctor and the lessons I've learnt forever.\"\nChibnall, who appointed the actress to replace Peter Capaldi in the role, has been in charge of the BBC One series since 2017.\nIt has not yet been announced who will take over from Whittaker in the leading role.\n\"In 2017 I opened my glorious gift box of size 13 shoes,\" Whittaker said in a statement. \"I could not have guessed the brilliant adventures, worlds and wonders I was to see in them.\"\nShe continued: \"My heart is so full of love for this show, for the team who make it, for the fans who watch it and for what it has brought to my life.\"\n\"And I cannot thank Chris enough for entrusting me with his incredible stories. We knew that we wanted to ride this wave side by side, and pass on the baton together. So here we are, weeks away from wrapping on the best job I have ever had. I don't think I'll ever be able to express what this role has given me. I will carry the Doctor and the lessons I've learnt forever. \n\"I know change can be scary and none of us know what's out there. That's why we keep looking. Travel hopefully. The universe will surprise you. Constantly.\"\nFor her final series, Whittaker will once again be joined by Mandip Gill as Yaz, and comedian John Bishop, who will play a new character named Dan.\nThe 13th Doctor's first episode in October 2018 was watched by 11.5m viewers, in the sci-fi drama's biggest audience for almost a decade. It was also the biggest show of that week, ahead of Strictly Come Dancing and the Great British Bake Off. \nBut the show's ratings have dropped in recent years. Whittaker's last episode, broadcast in January, attracted a consolidated audience of 6.3 million.\nWhile many have praised Whittaker's casting, some fans and critics have criticised the show's recent narrative direction.\nThe Telegraph described recent episodes as \"flat, worthy and woke\" despite Whittaker's talent as an actress, while The Sun reported viewers were left furious by the show's \"unbearable political correctness\".\nOne of the long-running drama's unique features has been regeneration, where the Doctor completely changes their physical appearance, allowing the show to recast its lead role every few years.\nChibnall is currently writing and producing the next series of Doctor Who, which will air later this year. It will be followed by three specials, the first of which will be broadcast on New Year's Day 2022, with another later in spring 2022. \nWhittaker's final feature-length special, where the 13th Doctor will regenerate, will transmit in autumn 2022 as part of the BBC's Centenary celebrations.\nSpeculation will now turn to who Whittaker's replacement might be, as Doctor Who approaches its 60th anniversary in 2023.\nAs well as introducing Whittaker as the first female Doctor, Chibnall also brought in Tosin Cole as Ryan, Mandip Gill (Yaz) and Bradley Walsh (Graham).\nEpisodes such as Rosa, Demons of the Punjab and Spyfall thrilled audiences, and netted the show two Bafta Must See Moment nominations, along with multiple National Television Award, Bafta Cymru, TV Choice and Critics Choice nominations.\nIn 2020, Whittaker was voted second most popular Doctor of all-time in a poll of 50,000 fans for the Radio Times, losing out to David Tennant.\nChibnall said: \"Jodie and I made a 'three series and out' pact with each other at the start of this once-in-a-lifetime blast. So now our shift is done, and we're handing back the Tardis keys. \n\"Jodie's magnificent, iconic Doctor has exceeded all our high expectations. She's been the gold standard leading actor, shouldering the responsibility of being the first female Doctor with style, strength, warmth, generosity and humour.\"\nHe added: \"She captured the public imagination and continues to inspire adoration around the world, as well as from everyone on the production.\n\"I can't imagine working with a more inspiring Doctor - so I'm not going to!\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has called for states to offer $100 (\u00a371) to the newly vaccinated in an effort to address flagging jab rates amid virus surges.\nThe president also issued a strict new vaccine requirement for US federal workers, the nation's largest workforce with some two million people. \nThe order requires employees to show proof of vaccination or be subjected to mandatory testing and masking.\nJust under half of the US is fully vaccinated, according to official data.\nSpeaking from the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden said that the new measures are a result of the highly contagious Delta variant's spread, made worse by a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated\". \n\"People are dying and will die who don't have to die,\" the president said.\nMr Biden added that the monetary incentive may seem unfair to already vaccinated Americans, but \"we all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated\". \nStates would use money from the $1.9tn American Rescue Plan legislation to fund the incentives.\nMr Biden said that the federal government will be \"fully reimbursing\" small or medium-sized businesses that provide workers paid time off to get vaccinated. \nWhile government workers who refuse to get vaccinated will not be fired, this move by the White House aims to set an example for other employers nationwide.\nBut public health experts warn that weekly testing is not an effective way of stopping outbreaks.\nThe Democratic president also addressed theories, spreading mostly in conservative circles, that the jabs are unsafe.\nHe emphasised there \"is nothing political\" about the vaccines, which were developed and authorised under a Republican administration and further distributed under his.\nLast month, a study showed that over 99% of Covid-19 deaths have been among the unvaccinated. \nNearly 70% of adults have received at least one jab, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control. But vaccination rates are varied across the country. Southern and western regions, which are now experiencing Covid outbreaks, have much lower rates.\nIt comes as virus-related deaths climb to around 2,000 per week. New cases are now at their highest point in the last three months, with about 60,000 being recorded per day.\nEarlier this week, the CDC revised its mask policy for even fully vaccinated Americans in certain regions due to the Delta variant surges. Indoor mask use is now recommended for people in areas with higher rates of Covid transmission.\nNew York, California, and several other states have gone one step further - requiring that masks be worn in public indoor spaces. \nIn other Covid news:\nBy BBC Reality Check\nUS President Joe Biden pointed towards New Mexico, Ohio and Colorado as reason for his $100 incentive, claiming it has helped increase vaccination rates.\nSo is there evidence for this?\nLast month, people in New Mexico who were fully vaccinated between 14 and 17 June got $100.\nThe amount of Johnson & Johnson shots administered in that period quadrupled. It requires just one shot - so it was the quickest way to receive the reward.\nAccording to the state's department of health, more than 20,000 people got either the Johnson & Johnson jab or their second dose of another vaccine between those dates.\nIn Ohio, the governor is offering state employees $100 for getting vaccinated and an additional $25 for their spouses if they do the same.\nBut this was only announced on 29 July, so it's too early to judge the impact. A similar programme in the state capital Columbus earlier in July saw the weekly vaccination rate increase three-fold.\nAnd in Colorado, since 22 July, people who are vaccinated at certain sites have been given a $100 gift card for the US retail store Walmart  - although so far there's not been a significant uptick in vaccinations."

      "text": "Former patients and children of a Canadian fertility doctor who used his own or unknown sperm to impregnate patients have been offered a C$13m ($10m, \u00a37m) settlement agreement.\nIt is thought to be the first-ever legal settlement of its kind.\nUnder the terms of the deal, claimants will be given compensation based on court-determined level of harm.\nMoney will also be set aside for a DNA database to allow dozens of children to identify their biological fathers. \nThe class-action lawsuit currently includes 226 people. Dr Barwin worked at two clinics in Ottawa, Ontario. \nSome couples who were told that the male partner's sperm would be used were unknowingly given random samples, and in some cases, the doctor's own.\nSome of the claims date back to the 1970s. Dr Barwin is now in his 80s and has not practiced since 2014. \nThe settlement must still be approved by a judge before any money will be made available.\nRebecca Dixon, 31, found out that her real father was Dr Barwin - whose clinic her parents had visited - after she developed a disease that nobody else in her family had. She and her parents launched the lawsuit in 2016. \n\"I am not sure we will ever achieve closure,\" she told the Ottawa-Citizen newspaper. \n\"It is something that will be with us for the rest of our lives. But the legal side wrapping up will allow people to come to a bit more peace with the situation.\"\nThe proposal also calls for C$75,000 to be used to set up a database for children conceived at his clinics to find out the identity of their father. The purpose of the database will be to provide children with the opportunity to identify their biological fathers, gain access to medical history and to locate any half-siblings. \nDr Barwin and his lawyer had no comment on the matter, but the settlement does not require the former fertility doctor to admit any fault. \nHe \"has denied and continues to deny all of the plaintiffs' claims in this action,\" lawyers said in court documents filed on Wednesday.\nIn 2019, Dr Barwin was stripped of his medical license by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which called his actions \"beyond reprehensible\"."

      "tags": "Public Health England,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A run of seven consecutive days with falling case numbers is raising hopes about the beginning of the end of the pandemic.\nEven notoriously cautious experts such as Prof Neil Ferguson are saying that by the autumn \"the bulk of the pandemic\" could be behind us.\nBut with Public Health England warning that \"we are still in the third wave\", how can you tell the blips from the real trends? \nAnd what stats should you look at to know whether we might be getting close to the end? \nDaily case numbers get the most attention because they're the first to arrive. \nBut they're flaky. They depend on things that tell us nothing about the virus, like whether people decide to get tested or how quickly test results come back.\nSo scientists use other measures to check the story in the case numbers. These take longer to arrive, but give a clearer picture of the true trends. \nHospital numbers reveal a lot about where the pandemic is at the moment. \nThey tell us about the trends in sickness, as opposed to positive tests, and how much pressure Covid is putting on the NHS. \nAnd the number of new admissions with coronavirus gives a better picture of the trends than the case numbers alone.  \nExperts have become much more confident that Scotland's fall in case numbers is real since they saw the hospital admissions follow suit a few days later. \nAdmissions are still rising in the UK overall in the most recent data, but more slowly than a week ago and hopefully will follow Scotland's lead in the coming week.  \nEvery Friday, the Office for National Statistics says how many people they think have coronavirus. \nThey work it out by picking people at random and testing them every few weeks. \nThis means they catch the infections that never reach the daily case numbers when people don't get symptoms or don't get tested.  \nTheir most recent data can't yet tell us about this week's falls as they were published a week ago and cover the week before that.\nThese figures aren't perfect. The tests they use are extremely sensitive and you can still test positive weeks after you've recovered from an infection. \nSo they capture people who, to all intents and purposes, no longer have coronavirus, which means the figures can take a while to spot a fall. But once they do, you can be pretty confident that the epidemic is shrinking. \nBut even if the epidemic is shrinking for real, will it keep on shrinking? You need to look elsewhere for clues. \nThe hope is that, eventually, we'll have enough people protected to put the brakes on the epidemic for good.  \nVaccination is doing the heavy lifting in getting us there at the moment.  \nMore than 150,000 people every day are getting a second dose of the vaccine, far more than are being infected every day. \nBut that's going to slow down soon, which will mean that more protection will come the harder way: through infections. \nFewer than 50,000 people a day are having their first dose right now. That sets a limit on how quickly we can grow double-dose protection in the future. \nIt looks like Gen-Xers and older millennials have topped out, with plenty of people in their 30s and 40s still to get their first dose. And younger adults are also starting to slow down.\nThe main unknown as we open up is how everyone will behave: will we party like it's 2019 or has the pandemic changed us for ever?  \nThe models that talked about a peak of thousands of people going into hospital each day were trying to imagine a world where we all rushed back to our offices, and rapidly returned to socialising like we did before the pandemic. \nSo attention is turning to surveys that ask people about their social contacts. This data didn't matter as much when we weren't allowed to mix and so contact numbers were kept artificially low. But now we'll be watching them more carefully. \nSo far, there hasn't been evidence of a rush back. This survey tracks how many people we touch or talk to (face-to-face) each day. \nBefore the pandemic, adults averaged 10 contacts a day. We don't have much data for July, but even in June, when most restrictions were lifted, adults were still averaging fewer than four contacts a day, far below pre-pandemic levels. \nThis suggests the return will be slower and offers hope that the worst-case scenarios envisioned by the government's models may not come to pass. \nAll these figures will give you a feel for the likely coming trends, but with all the competing effects of nightclub openings and school holidays still to play out, it's still a foolhardy person who would bet on the exact day the pandemic turns.   \nThis article, published on 28 July, was amended on 14 October 2021 to make clear that the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is different to the number of people with Covid.

      "text": "Team GB's swimming heroics at Tokyo 2020 might have inspired you to get off the sofa, grab your goggles and do a few lengths of your local pool.\nBut what separates an Olympic champion from us mere mortals? \nAccording to the performance psychologist for gold medallist Adam Peaty, the answer is mental strength. \nBill Beswick's worked with the 26-year-old breaststroke machine since he was 17 and says Adam's winning mindset is the best he's seen. \nBill tells Radio 1 Newsbeat there are two major factors to becoming a champion: being physically capable and having the attitude \"to compete, train and win everyday\".\n\"You can get away with less talent and a great attitude but you can't get away with a bad attitude.\"\nAdam, from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, is one of the fastest swimmers in history, and won his first Olympic title at Rio 2016.\nNo-one has even come close to his world record time of 56.88 seconds.\nAdam follows a mental ritual to get in the zone ahead of his 6am and 6pm training sessions each day, Bill says.\nHe makes a point of pausing before he enters the pool and focusing on \"training like a champion\", the psychologist adds.\n\"He sets his standard at that moment. That is how an athlete builds mental strength,\" Bill adds.\nAdam won Team GB's first gold medal of Tokyo 2020 in the 100m breaststroke on Monday to become the first British swimmer to defend an Olympic title.\nEven more medals could be on the way for Adam - he'll be in the 4x100m mixed medley final on Saturday after the quartet broke the European record to win their heat on Thursday. And he's in the men's 4x100m medley heats on Friday too.\nHis performance in Tokyo so far is a particularly huge achievement considering the disruption Covid had on training - at times during lockdown Adam wasn't even able to train in a pool. \n\"It would have been much harder if Adam hadn't have been trained that when setbacks happen, we deal with them,\" Bill says.\n\"Not only has he dealt with the delay of the Olympics and changes to his training schedule, he's also dealt with the Olympics taking place in a very unique and strange environment.\"\nHe's referring to what's going on for all athletes in Tokyo - no crowds, no face-to-face support from his family, regular Covid testing and periods of isolation.\nBill refuses to take full credit for the star's winning mentality and says Adam's swimming coach, Mel Marshall, is \"perfect for him\".\nA former Olympic swimmer herself, Mel has been coaching Adam since he was 14. \nThey met at the City of Derby Swimming Club, where he began training after being recommended by a family friend.\n\"He's come into swimming at the perfect time,\" Bill says, adding that British Swimming's Chris Spice has created \"a superb team environment\".\nChris joined British Swimming back in 2013 as the national performance director to help improve the success of British swimming at major tournaments.\n\"London 2012 was a disappointing Olympics for swimming - he brought me into the remit to change the environment from a victim mentality to a fighter mentality,\" Bill says.\n\"The organisation wasn't in great shape, but we've created a perfect coaching environment and one of the great consequences is that we've produced Adam Peaty.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "text": "BTec qualifications should not be scrapped in England, say groups representing students and staff in schools, colleges and universities.\nThe plea comes as the Department for Education confirmed plans to introduce new technical qualifications in England and scrap most BTecs.\nThe department says the reforms will simplify and streamline the system.\nBut education leaders warn getting rid of BTecs is \"reckless\", as it will harm the prospects of poorer pupils.\nTwelve organisations have written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson urging him not to ditch BTec qualifications.\nThey estimate that at least 30% of 16 to 18-year-olds studying for a Level 3 qualification in England (the equivalent of A-levels) are doing vocational qualifications such as BTecs. \nThis equates to around 259,291 young people.\nThe letter states that a review into the proposed changes ignored the widespread concerns expressed about getting rid of BTecs.\n\"Many young people will be adversely affected by this proposal, but disadvantaged students have the most to lose, a conclusion that your department's own equalities impact assessment supports\", the letter warns. \nIt describes qualifications like BTecs as \"engines of social mobility\" and cites research from the Social Market Foundation, which found 44% of white working-class students entered university with at least one BTec and 37% of black students entered with only BTec qualifications. \nThe organisations say: \"It is impossible to square the government's stated ambition to 'level up' opportunity with the proposal to scrap most BTecs.\"\nBTecs are vocational qualifications taken after GCSEs, providing work-based skills in a range of areas such as healthcare, business and engineering. \nEarlier this month, the Department of Education confirmed that apprenticeships, A-levels and T-levels - new, two-year technical courses which are the equivalent of three A-levels - will become the main options for pupils in England after GCSEs.\nAs a result, funding for most BTec qualifications will be removed. \nThe new system, which has been given the green light after a consultation with the education sector, students and parents, will be phased in between 2023 and 2025.\nBut Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would be \"reckless\" of the government to ditch BTecs simply to clear the way for T-levels.\n\"Applied general qualifications give many disadvantaged young people an established route to higher education, apprenticeships and future careers.\"\nJames Kewin, deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: \"Applied general qualifications like BTecs are popular with students, respected by employers and provide a well-established route to higher education or employment. \n\"So it is hard to fathom why the government wants to scrap most of them and force young people to choose between studying A-levels or T-levels from the age of 16.\"\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said: \"At a time when young people need more support than ever to realise and rebuild their futures, scrapping these qualifications is a retrograde step which will damage the prospects of the most disadvantaged students.\n\"We should be expanding the pathways for young people to succeed and flourish, not closing them off.\"\nThe DfE has said employers would play a key role in helping to design technical qualifications so they deliver the skilled workforce that businesses need.\nMr Williamson said: \"These reforms will simplify and streamline the current system, ensuring that whatever qualification a young person or an adult chooses, they can be confident that it will be high-quality and will lead to good outcomes.\""

Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age.\nSeparate rules will continue to apply for those arriving from France. Travellers who have been in France in the 10 days before arriving in England must quarantine for 10 days after arrival, and take a Covid test on or before day two and on or after day eight, even if fully vaccinated.\nThe UK government said the overall rule changes would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the reopening of travel was \"progress we can all enjoy\".\nHowever, international cruises are unlikely to be available from Monday.\nOn its website, P&O Cruises said following their UK summer staycations, its Britannia ship will begin planned western Mediterranean itineraries on 25 September, while its Iona vessel will launch on the same date.\nIt said due to the current traffic light system, a \"number of itineraries have had to be cancelled\".\nCruises on Ventura have been paused until 3 October 2021, while cruises on its Azura ship have been halted up until 10 December 2021. Some others have been delayed until 2022.\nCunard's first UK cruise will sail on 13 August with international cruises beginning in October.\nBoth firms are part of US giant Carnival cruises, which is one of the world's biggest cruise companies.\nThe hugely profitable business was brought to its knees by Covid after regulators around the world stopped ships from sailing to try and limit outbreaks.\nThere were outbreaks on various cruise liners, including some owned by Carnival.\nRichard Ballantyne, chief executive at the British Ports Association (BPA), said UK domestic cruises had demonstrated how ports and cruise lines could \"ensure the health and safety of passengers, crew and destinations\".\nHe said the organisation is \"hopeful that the devolved administrations will follow suit shortly\" in allowing international cruises.\nThe British Ports Association, which represents more than 400 ports, terminal operators and port facilities, said it was \"disappointed\" that arrivals from France still need to quarantine on arrival into England for ten days.\nThe global cruise line industry has been one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn 2019, it contributed more than $154bn (\u00a3110bn) to the global economy, according to the trade body Cruise Lines International Association, before the shops were all anchored due to the lockdown.\nCarnival, which made a profit of $3bn in 2019, reported a loss of $10bn in 2020 after its revenues plunged 73%.\nThere is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on ships due to passengers and crew mixing from different parts of the world, according to experts.\nIn 2020 there were major outbreaks on cruise ships, including the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess.\nAccording to the most recent statistics on data site Worldometer, 22 countries have still had fewer Covid cases than were found on the Diamond Princess, and 27 countries have had fewer than its 13 deaths."

      "tags": "Cannabis ,United States",
      "text": "US sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson will be missing the Tokyo Olympics because she tested positive for marijuana during the US Track & Field trials. With cannabis legal in many states across America, why is it still outlawed in sports?\nWith her flowing tangerine orange hair, killer smile and lightning speed, Sha'Carri Richardson was unmissable in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. \nConsidered the sixth-fastest woman in history, with a best-ever time for the 100m of 10.72, the Texas sprinter was expected to be a major contender for the Gold medal in Tokyo.\nBut when her teammates take to the track for the women's 100m heats on Friday, she won't be there.\nIn early July, it was announced that Ms Richardson would not be representing the US at the games because she had tested positive for cannabis use during the qualifying race.\nAs punishment, the US Anti-Doping Agency banned her from competing for one month and expunged her qualifying victory. Although the 30-day suspension technically ended during the Tokyo games, US Athletics chose not to include her on the team.\nHer disqualification has reignited a long debate over marijuana prohibition in Olympic sports. \nGiven that it is legal in many US states, and that its performance-enhancing properties are disputed, many wonder why cannabis should still be banned.\nMarijuana (cannabis) has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) since the organisation first created its list of prohibited substances in 2004. Items on the list meet two out of three criteria:\nCriteria 1: They harm the health of the athlete\nCriteria 2: They are performance enhancing\nCriteria 3: They are against the spirit of sport\nIt is the second point that people seem to take the most issue with when it comes to weed, and it has become the subject of many late-night punchlines.\n\"The only way it's a performance-enhancing drug is if there's a big [expletive] Hershey bar at the end of the run,\" joked the late comedian Robin Williams.\nIn 2011, Wada defended the ban on cannabis in a paper published in the journal Sports Medicine. Citing a study on marijuana's ability to reduce anxiety, Wada found cannabis could help athletes \"better perform under pressure and to alleviate stress experienced before and during competition\".\nBut those findings aren't enough to warrant concluding marijuana is a performance-enhancing drug, argues Alain Steve Comtois, director of the department of sports science at the University of Quebec at Montreal.\n\"You have to take the big picture,\" he tells the BBC. \"Yes anxiety levels go down, but in terms of actual physiological data, it shows that performance is reduced.\"\nMr Comtois was one of the authors of a 2021 Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness review of research on marijuana use before exercise and its capacity to enhance athletic performance.\nThe paper found that most research points to marijuana hindering physiological responses necessary for high performance, by raising blood pressure and decreasing strength and balance.\nThe paper did not look at the effects of marijuana on anxiety, but Mr Comtois says its other negative effects would counteract any benefits, giving the idea that marijuana can enhance athletic performance \"no merit\".\nBut there is more to Wada's rule than just a ban on performance-enhancing drugs.\nFounded in 1999 after several high-profile doping scandals at the Olympics, Wada aimed to lead the charge to end doping in sports around the globe. When coming up with its list of banned substances in 2004, marijuana was illegal in almost every country in the world.\n\"They didn't want to get in social respectability trouble,\" says John Hoberman, a cultural historian who researches the history of anti-doping at the University of Texas-Austin.\nIts status as an illicit drug was cited by Wada in the 2011 paper as one of the reasons why marijuana offended the \"spirit of sport\" (criteria 3) and was \"not consistent with the athlete as a role model for young people around the world\". \nThe rule has led to reprimands for not only Ms Richardson, but also dozens of other athletes.\nIn 2009, Michael Phelps was banned from competition for three months, and lost his Kellogg's sponsorship, after photos of him smoking marijuana were leaked online. \nUS sprinter John Capel was banned for two years after testing positive for a second time in 2006. \nBefore Wada created the prohibited drug list, the International Olympic Committee tried to take away Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati's gold medal because he tested positive. \nIt was returned after a court ruled there was no official rule against it - the IOC banned it two months later. \nBut over the past decade, marijuana's legal status - and society's attitude towards it - has begun to shift. \nUruguay was the first to make it legal to buy and sell marijuana for recreational use in 2013, with Canada following suit in 2018.\nMany more countries have decriminalised it to a some degree, including South Africa, Australia, Spain and the Netherlands. \nIn the US, it is illegal federally, but it is legal in about a third of states  - including the state of Oregon where Ms Richardson tested positive.\nThere has also been an increasing acceptance of cannabis use for medical purposes, with many countries, including the UK, allowing medical marijuana.\nIn fact, in 2019, Wada removed cannabidiol (CBD), a component of cannabis, from the banned list, even though the chemical remains illegal in some countries, like Japan, where the Olympics are hosted this year.\nThese changes have fuelled the current criticism of Ms Richardson's ban.\nThe runner told NBC News that she had used marijuana to cope with the death of her mother a week before the qualifier.\n\"I greatly apologise if I let you guys down - and I did. This will be the last time the US comes home without a gold in the 100m,\" she said. \n Amid an outpour of sympathy for Ms Richardson, Wada faced a dilemma. As Mr Hoberman puts it: \"You can't run an organisation that is rules bound, and simply dissolve a rule at a convenient moment\".\nBecause the cannabis ban is still on the books, an exception could not be easily made for Ms Richardson.\n\"And so this young woman was victimised by the existence of this rule,\" says Mr Hoberman.\nIt's unclear if or when Wada will reconsider the ban on cannabis but pressure is mounting for it to do so.\nMs Richardson's suspension prompted US President Joe Biden to question the current law, although he fell short of saying it should be overturned, prompting rumours the White House could step in.\n\"Rules are the rules. Everybody knows what the rules are going in,\" Biden told reporters Saturday in Michigan. \"Whether they should remain that way, whether that should remain the rule, is a different issue.\"\nEven the United States Anti-doping Agency, the American authority that enforces Wada's rules, said \"it's time to revisit the issue.\"\nUntil then, Ms Richardson, and other athletes like her, will have to stay away from cannabis, or stay on the sidelines.

      "text": "A drug company that increased the price of a crucial thyroid remedy more than 10-fold has prompted fines of more than \u00a3100m by the competition watchdog.\nAdvanz pushed up the price of thyroid tablet packs from \u00a320 in 2009 to \u00a3248 in 2017, making the drug unaffordable for the NHS.\nIt \"exploited a loophole enabling it to reap much higher profits\", the Competition and Markets Authority said.\nThe fine applies to Advanz and two private equity firms.\nThe CMA said its latest fine sent \"a clear message\" to the pharmaceutical sector that breaking the law would not be tolerated.\nIt said an investigation had shown that from 2009 until 2017, Advanz charged excessive and unfair prices for supplying liothyronine tablets, which are used to treat thyroid hormone deficiency. \n\"They achieved this because liothyronine tablets were among a number of drugs that, although genericised, faced limited or no competition and therefore could sustain repeated price increases,\" the CMA said in a statement.\nBut a spokesman for Advanz said: \"We utterly disagree with the CMA's decision on the pricing of liothyronine tablets and will be appealing.\n\"At all times, Advanz Pharma acted in the interest of patients, investing significantly to keep this medicine on the market to the specifications required by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\"\nAdvanz Pharma specialises in complicated, difficult-to-manufacture drugs that are no longer protected by patents. Anyone can make them, but because they are more complex than normal medicines, most generic drug makers choose not to. \nThis specialisation, the Advanz website boasts, \"provides essential cost-savings to the NHS and wider European healthcare\". The Competition and Markets Authority's investigation found another motivation, at least when it came to the supply of one type of thyroid tablets, which contain the chemical liothyronine, to the NHS. \nFrom 2007, the company adopted a deliberate \"price optimisation\" strategy, which meant exploiting these niche products to drive up prices. \nThe increases were staggering - 6,000% over a nine-year period - and led eventually to the NHS dropping the drug from its purchase lists altogether. This left patients who suffered from thyroid deficiency and relied on liothyronine tablets - rather than the more common levothyroxine tablets - with the choice of giving up their treatment or having to buy their own tablets at great expense.  \nAdvanz itself was directly fined \u00a340.9m. Private equity firms HgCapital and Cinven, which were previously owners of the businesses now forming part of Advanz, were fined \u00a38.6m and \u00a351.9m respectively.\nMichael Grenfell, executive director for enforcement at the CMA, told the BBC that the decision to push up the price of the drug had had \"a real human cost\".\n\"The NHS simply wasn't able to afford it on the scale that was needed,\" he said.\nHe added that a number of drug companies were \"engaged in anti-competitive practices that have racked up expenses for the NHS\".\nPrior to Advanz lifting prices, the NHS spent \u00a3600,000 on the tablets in 2006. \nJust three years later, that had risen to more than \u00a32.3m and by 2016, the CMA said the NHS was paying \u00a330m for the drug.\nThe CMA said that Advanz's decision to increase the price of the treatment was \"not driven by any meaningful innovation or investment, volumes remained broadly stable, and the cost of producing the tablets did not increase significantly\". \nAs well as imposing a substantial fine, the CMA said its decision will also make it \"easier for the NHS to seek compensation for the firms' behaviour, by way of damages, should it choose to do so\".\nThe thyroid gland makes hormones - called T4 and T3 - that affect things like heart rate and body temperature. Some people have an underactive thyroid and need to take drugs to boost their hormone levels.\nMost patients with hypothyroidism - the medical name for symptoms caused by an underactive thyroid - take a drug called levothyroxine or T4.\nBut some say they feel better if they take a different, more expensive thyroid drug called liothyronine or T3.\nT4 is the inactive version of T3 - the body needs to convert it into T3, which might explain why some people say they benefit from liothyronine. \nBut prescribing it remains somewhat controversial because of the high cost and limited research to prove its worth. \nGuidelines recommend T4 as standard, but do not rule out people being prescribed T3. With more manufacturers now making and supplying T3, the cost is going down. \nThis is the second time this month that the CMA has taken action against excessive price rises imposed by pharmaceutical firms.\nTwo weeks ago, it imposed fines of more than \u00a3260m after finding that Auden Mckenzie and Actavis UK (now known as Accord-UK) \"charged the NHS excessively high prices\" for hydrocortisone tablets for almost a decade.\nAt the time, CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the NHS was at one point being charged more than \u00a380 for a single pack of tablets that had previously cost less than \u00a31.\nHe added that the fine served as \"a warning to any other drug firm planning to exploit the NHS\"."

When he told us that, we were crying.\"\nHe was saved from drowning by a younger friend who saw him in the water and flipped him over.\n\"Callum managed to say 'help me', but he was only half-talking because he couldn't breathe,\" Ms Lloyd added.\nHis friends held him in the sea as a paddle-board was fetched to get him on to the beach.\nAn ambulance was called and once paramedics stabilised Mr Jones, he was taken to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.\nBut he was flown to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff for surgery after an X-ray showed he had completely shattered the C5 vertebra bone in his neck.\nUsing a metal plate and bone from his hip, surgeons built Mr Jones a new C5 bone.\nMs Lloyd said he was breathing through a tube in his throat and communicating by blinking. \nShe said she feared the road to recovery would be hard for her nephew.\nHis mother may have to give up work to look after him, she said, adding a fundraising page had been set up to fund physiotherapy.\n\"At best he will be in a wheelchair,\" Ms Lloyd said, adding he had \"a slight feeling\" in his arms on Wednesday.\n\"They said that's a really positive sign but we can't get too hopeful.\""

      "tags": "Corruption,Malta",
      "text": "A public inquiry into the assassination of Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has found the state responsible for her death.\nThe report said the state had failed to recognise risks to the reporter's life and take reasonable steps to avoid them.\nCaruana Galizia died in a car bomb attack near her home in October 2017.\nAn investigation led to PM Joseph Muscat's resignation in 2019 after his close associates were implicated.\nHowever, he has denied corruption allegations.\nCalled a \"one-woman Wikileaks\", Caruana Galizia uncovered networks of corruption in the country and abroad.\nAged 53 when she died, she spent 30 years as a journalist. She relentlessly accused Maltese politicians and other officials of corruption in her popular Running Commentary blog.\nShe was a harsh critic of government. In 2017 she effectively triggered an early election by publishing allegations linking Mr Muscat to the Panama Papers scandal, which exposed the use of tax havens by the rich. \nCaruana Galizia's family sought an independent public inquiry into her murder. \nMr Muscat gave it the go-ahead, a few months before he resigned. \nIn the last two years, the inquiry has heard from dozens of witnesses, including investigators, politicians and journalists.\nIn its conclusions, written up in a 437-page report, it said the state had \"created an atmosphere of impunity, generated by the highest echelons\". \nIt cited an \"unwarranted closeness\" between big business and government. The report also made recommendations to improve laws and better protect journalists in Malta. \nSo far only a handful of individuals have been charged.\nIn February, one of three men accused of murdering Caruana Galizia pleaded guilty and was jailed for 15 years. \nThe others are yet to go to trial.\nA fourth person, Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech, has also been charged with complicity over the killing - an allegation he denies. \nHe was arrested in November 2019 as he tried to sail away from Malta on a yacht, and is now awaiting trial. \nAfter Caruana Galizia's assassination, her son Paul hit out at what he called the country's \"mafia state\". \nHis mother had been killed \"because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it\", he said. \nIn a statement on Thursday, her family said: \"We hope that its findings will lead to the restoration of the rule of law in Malta\". \nPrime Minister Robert Abela said of the report: \"Lessons must be drawn and the reforms must continue with greater resolve.\"\nHe also said he felt \"duty bound to apologise\" to Caruana Galizia's family and \"all those aggrieved by this dark episode in our country's history\"."

      "text": "Investing in education in the world's poorest countries is the \"single best investment we can make in the future of humanity\", Boris Johnson told a global education summit in London.\nWorld leaders pledged more than $4bn (\u00a32.9bn) to support schools through the Global Partnership for Education.\nNobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai told the summit girls in particular faced an \"education crisis\".\nBut charities warned the UK's aid cuts had harmed fundraising efforts.\nThe Global Partnership for Education, which distributes funding in more than 90 poorer countries, wanted to raise $5bn (\u00a33.6bn) to create an extra 88 million school places and support the learning of 175 million children during the next five years.\nPledges at the summit, hosted by the UK and Kenya, included:\nJulia Gillard, former Australian prime minister and chair of the education aid organisation, was confident that the full $5bn would be raised, but different national budget cycles would mean it would arrive in stages.\nShe said the pandemic had disrupted education in all countries - but the impact of closing schools had been much worse in poorer countries where many families lacked access at home to internet connections or electricity.\nThe UK prime minister hailed the fundraising initiative, saying investing in international education projects was a way of tackling \"ignorance and prejudice\" and boosting the economies of poorer countries.\n\"I'm immensely proud of the achievements of this summit today and I'm proud of what the UK has been able to contribute in spite of the difficult financial circumstances,\" Mr Johnson said.\nImproving access to good quality education, particularly for girls, was the \"panacea, the universal cure,\" the prime minister said.\n\"This is the Swiss Army knife, complete with Allen key, a screwdriver and everything else,\" he told the summit.\nBut charity Save the Children said the fundraising drive had lost leverage because of the UK's own aid cuts, which had left it with \"diminishing leadership on the world stage\".\nThe One anti-poverty campaign warned of a \"decidedly underwhelming result\", saying the UK's overseas aid cut had \"damaged our credibility\".\nGabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam, questioned the priorities of a world in which billionaires could compete in launching private space rockets while millions of children are unable to go to school.\nShe also warned of the negative impact from the UK \"dramatically cutting aid\".\nMalala Yousafzai told the summit of the importance of investing in education for girls in countries where they had fewer opportunities \"just because of their gender\".\n\"The world is facing a girls' education crisis,\" the education campaigner said, with more than 130 million out of school around the world and millions more at risk of not returning after the pandemic.\n\"Their futures are worth fighting for,\" she told the summit.\nKenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, told the conference the fundraising event could \"avert an education catastrophe\".\n\"Education is the best equaliser,\" says Angel Mbuthia, a Kenyan campaigner for access to education, who is supporting the global education summit.\nThe 26-year-old student leader, currently secretary for gender at the All Africa Students' Union, says education provides a \"ripple effect in giving solutions to our most pressing problems\".\nFor instance improving health education is more cost effective than having to treat serious illnesses.\n\"Once you have a citizenry that is well-educated, they're able to take more preventative measures,\" she says.\nPreventing youth unemployment, creating more hi-tech industries, \"political awareness\" and promoting gender equality in Kenya will all depend on improving education, she says.\n\"It's a bedrock, the best foundation,\" she says,\nAngel supports campaigns for girls to have fair access to education, in rural areas as well as cities, and wants that to lead to fair representation in areas such as politics and the legal system.\nShe argues that events such as the global summit need to give a voice to those who are excluded from a chance of education.\nIn terms of whether donor countries should fund education elsewhere, she says individual countries cannot only look within their own borders - because international issues will still affect them, whether it's refugees, Covid or climate change.\n\"That's one realisation we've had from Covid-19,\" she says. An outbreak in China is now \"affecting someone in a very rural part of Kenya\".\n\"We have a responsibility to be global citizens, to talk about these issues,\" she says."

      "text": "The cost of the proposed new Casement Park stadium in west Belfast could be more than \u00a3140m, First Minister Paul Givan has suggested.\nEarlier, the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) estimated the cost could be more than \u00a3110m.\nPlanning permission for the 34,500-capacity stadium was granted on Wednesday.\nThe GAA hopes work can be completed by summer 2024. Funding for the long-running project has yet to be agreed.\nMr Givan's comment would place the cost at almost double the original estimate of \u00a377.5m, the majority of which was to come from the Stormont Executive.\nThe GAA has insisted it does not intend to increase its \u00a315m contribution.\nOn Thursday, Mr Givan told BBC News NI: \"That figure of \u00a3110m is based upon 2019. \n\"We are looking at around a 25% inflationary figure for capital projects and so if you put that on to Casement Park, you may well be looking at more like a \u00a3140m or \u00a3150m price tag.\"\nAsked if he would still support the project, he said: \"In principle, Casement Park should be redeveloped but I think it would be churlish of any government not to be looking at all the costs associated with capital projects.\"\nMr Givan said no decisions could be made until the price of the project was worked out.\nEarlier, Stephen McGeehan, head of operations at Ulster GAA, told BBC News NI: \"It will be more than \u00a3110m, there's no question about that because those costs are based on summer 2019. \n\"Clearly we're now two years further on from that so costs have increased.\n\"The final cost will be determined in the business case.\"\nThe GAA hopes some work can begin on the new stadium before the end of the year, with major construction work starting in the first half of 2022.\nDiscussing the organisation's contribution to the cost of the project, Mr McGeehan said: \"Clearly this is a very challenging time for the public sector, but it's also very challenging for organisations like the GAA.\n\"We reduced our income last year by something of the circa of \u20ac60m (\u00a351m). We're due to have shortfalls in our budgets this year.\n\"People should also remember this is an executive programme.\n\"Soccer have had their strategic requirements delivered at Windsor Park, similarly at Ravenhill [for rugby], and we congratulate them for that, and we now have waited an awful long time for that to happen for the GAA.\"\nAs well as the financial issues, another difficulty facing the Casement Park project is potential legal action by a group of residents opposed to the new stadium.\nThey have in the past argued that the stadium is too large to be built in a heavily-populated area.\nPlanning permission for a 38,000-seater stadium was granted in 2013 but later overturned as a result of a judicial review.\nSince then, the design of the proposed stadium has been changed and the capacity reduced.\nThe GAA said it was now going to hold a \"brand new community engagement programme\".\nMr McGeehan said: \"We are going to meet with all of the local community, we're going to meet with all local businesses, all local residents, we're going to put our case back to them.\"\nHe said he believed the project would have long-term economic, community and social benefits, and create jobs in the area.\nThe west Belfast residents' group which has been campaigning against the new stadium has so far made no comment about the granting of planning permission."

      "text": "Downing Street has insisted it is \"crucial\" to self-isolate when sent an alert by the Covid app - and businesses should help employees to do so.\nIt comes after business minister Paul Scully said he would encourage people who are \"pinged\" to self-isolate but they can make an \"informed decision\". \nThe app has always been voluntary to download and any alerts are advisory.\nLabour accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\" and creating confusion.\nIn recent days, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption.\nPub chains, supermarkets, transport networks and other businesses have warned of the crippling effect blanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations.\nPeople who are \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app and told they have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nHowever, anyone contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace - either by phone, text or email - must self-isolate.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported a further 46,558 new daily Covid cases alongside another 96 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMeanwhile, a \"very small\" number of critical workers - including NHS and care staff - could carry on working even if told to self-isolate under a new government scheme.\nIndustry bodies reacted to the plan with dismay, describing it as \"simply unworkable\", amid confusion over how it would operate.\nDowning Street confirmed the first exemptions had been issued under the scheme by government departments.\nNo 10 was unable to say how many people the government will approve for the loosened rules.\nPlans for the fully vaccinated to be made exempt from self-isolation were delayed until 16 August in England, with ministers warning at the time of a huge knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS. \nIn a BBC interview, Mr Scully was asked whether people should self-isolate if they are \"pinged\". \"I would absolutely encourage people to do that. But they can make an informed decision,\" he replied.\n\"I don't want to have to mandate people and tell people what to do as government any longer than I really have to. \n\"But they do have a responsibility to themselves, to their families and to their communities. It's by doing the right thing that we can keep Covid at bay.\"\nEarlier, he told Times Radio that self-isolating after being told to by the app was a decision for individuals and employers.\n\"It's important to understand the rules,\" he said. \"You have to legally isolate if you are... contacted by Test and Trace, or if you're trying to claim isolation payments. The app is there to allow you to make informed decisions.\"\nThe Times is also reporting that ministers have written to major manufacturers emphasising that staff are not legally obliged to isolate if \"pinged\". Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\", the paper said.\nFollowing the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the \"most important action\" people can take to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,\" a No 10 spokeswoman said.\n\"Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation.\"\nNow that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. \nBut a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. \nIn the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. \nSo the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if \"pinged\" by the app is crucial. \nAlthough it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. \nThat's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. \nThe rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. \nUntil then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. \nJohn Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained \"as stringently as we can\".\n\"We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,\" he told Times Radio. \nJustin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\".  \n\"Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,\" he said. \nWhile the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days.\nFailure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.\nIn other developments:"

Footage posted on social media that evening showed two officers holding a handcuffed black man on the pavement.\nFollowing the arrest, one Met officer was suspended and another was placed on restricted duties, the force said.\nThe IOPC report said investigators had found no evidence the man had been treated differently because of his race.\nIts investigation supported the police's claim Mr Coutain was stopped because he matched the description of someone suspected of an assault.\nThe IOPC found the officer should be investigated for a breach of the code of conduct around \"authority, respect and courtesy\" for the way he spoke to the man and nearby members of the public.\nIt said this could also be dealt with by reflective practice.\nMr Coutain's lawyer, Timur Rustem, said: \"You have a situation where an officer places a knee on a man's neck during an arrest.\n\"This is not a technique police are authorised to use, which can lead to injury or death - as seen in America with the case of George Floyd.\n\"To allow the police to take a reflective period over such a serious case undermines public confidence in the policing.\""

Oil giant BP has told office staff they can spend two days a week working from home and several banks are examining hybrid home-office arrangements.\nPre-pandemic some small firms already offered staff unlimited leave, including the oboss of Virgin Group, Sir Richard Branson, who offered his 170 personal staff as much holiday as they wanted.\nBut critics say it can backfire, with staff actually taking less holiday as a result.\nBen Gately, chief operating officer at UK software firm CharlieHR, ended up offering staff other benefits such as more flexible working hours instead.\n\"People didn't take enough [holiday],\" Ben Gately told the BBC at the time.\n\"People are pretty bad at taking holiday, we're all scared to do it because we have to do our handovers and pass stuff over and meet deadlines.\n\"There's a huge amount of anxiety about not knowing the limit. A bunch of our team came to us and said: 'Actually we'd love to know where the line is. Is it okay to take 35 days? Is it okay to take 25 days? Where should I draw the line?' Because the reality is that it's not actually unlimited.\"\nBumble has said it's also offering staff additional types of paid leave including 20 days for staff who are victims of domestic violence and other violent crimes and a minimum of 15 days bereavement leave for miscarriages.\nLisa King OBE, director of communications and external relations at domestic abuse charity Refuge, told the BBC more workplaces needed to be empathetic to employees who may be experiencing domestic abuse.\n\"Domestic abuse is the biggest social issue impacting women and children and it's great to see that companies are beginning to recognise this and place it at the centre of their policies. We hope that other companies follow their lead,\" she continued. \nBumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers.\nWith lockdown restrictions, the dating app saw a the number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, up by 30% to 2.8 million, in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year. \nIts founder Whitney Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. Bumble shares however, have shed 25% since the company's initial public offering in February.\nMs Wolfe Herd also co-founded dating app Tinder, but left the firm alleging sexual harassment. Tinder's parent company Match Group Inc, which denied the claims and later tried unsuccessfully to acquire Bumble, paid about $1m to settle the dispute.\nThe company has 42 million monthly users in over 150 countries and recently announced plans for a new caf\u00e9 and wine bar in New York."

We feel that we can build something that is not only for us, but for our children and grandchildren, so we will not forget what happened.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the decision tweeting: \"We have a duty to ensure that the Holocaust is never forgotten and that it will continue to be taught to future generations.\"\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC the memorial and learning centre would \"educate and inform future generations about the horrors of the Holocaust\" and that he hoped millions of people would visit it every year.\nHe added that it would also foster a better understanding of \"the British role in the tragedy - the things we did right and we did wrong\".\nAnd Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer backed the project, arguing it was \"vital\" in educating future generations about the Holocaust.\nMarie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \"There will be something uniquely powerful about locating a memorial to the Holocaust right next to the centre of the UK's democracy.\n\"Whilst the Holocaust was a particular crime against Jewish people, the Nazis also viciously persecuted Roma, gay and disabled people, and this memorial will speak to that.\"\nShe added: \"The messages and learnings that one should glean from its memorialisation are a powerful reminder of the universal values of fairness and justice that a democratic society has the responsibility to bestow upon its citizens.\"\nSome Jewish leaders have voiced their concerns about the memorial. \nSix million Jewish men, women and children and other victims were murdered by the Nazis during the Second World War."

There is a lack of information at the moment,\" she said.\n\"I've been relying on people to tell me what's accessible and what's not. \n\"And that's quite hard because I don't know if it's accessible for me. \n\"Every mobility problem is different, so what someone sees is accessible might not be to me. \n\"So, it's about getting that information out there so people can see what the terrain is like and make a decision for themselves.\"\nMiranda Evans, policy and programmes manager at Disability Wales, said the issue \"takes away disabled people's freedom\". \n\"There needs to be a solution that doesn't restrict disabled people's access, because it also affects parents, carers and other family members,\" she said.\n\"On certain beauty spots, and along the coastal path, disabled people might have to turn around and go home because they can't progress on their routes. \n\"It destroys the experience and knocks people's confidence, and they're not likely to venture that far afield again because it's very restrictive.\"\nThe campaign group said it wanted better information online \"at our fingertips\".\nTricia Cottnam is the officer for the south Wales section of the coastal path which covers the route between Gower in the west and Chepstow in the east.\n\"What we are trying to do is get as many people as possible to use the path,\" she said.\n\"There are going to be limitations because of its very nature.\"\nOpened in 2012, the path became the first in the world to stretch the length of entire nation's coast from the Dee estuary in Flintshire, to the Severn estuary in Monmouthshire.\n\"You will come across rocky surfaces on cliffs, steep gradients and sand dunes but that's the nature and the beauty of the coast path,\" said Ms Cottnam.\n\"But there are small changes we can make, where we can explain about the gradients, explain about the type of surface there might be, what type of gates or stiles are on parts of the path, so people can decide whether to make that journey or not. \n\"And it's all about description and not prescription. It can't be one size fits all. We must be flexible.\"\nFor Ms Harris, a former patient at Cardiff's Rookwood Hospital, the challenge of the path is proving harder than she expected.\nShe has completed 50 miles so far (80km), and has been raising money for Horatio's Garden, which creates gardens in NHS spinal injury centres, and the Rookwood Spur charity.\nThe money will provide a tranquil space for spinal injury patients at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, which is where the new Welsh Spinal Cord Rehabilitation Centre is being located, to replace facilities at the Rookwood site.  \n\"There's already areas which I think could be improved such as access alongside stiles and dropped curbs in some places, and I've already fed that information back to Wales Coast Path,\" said Ms Harris.\n\"I know certain areas in the Gower, Pembrokeshire, Ll\u0177n Peninsula, aren't going to be accessible for me but I have a team of helpers who will do these parts I can't do. \n\"It's going to be a great journey.\n\"I'm loving that I'm finding places that are accessible and getting that information out there and improving the situation for a lot of people.\""

      "tags": "Met Office,Our Planet Now,Climate change",
      "text": "The UK is already undergoing disruptive climate change with increased rainfall, sunshine and temperatures, according to scientists.\nThe year 2020 was the third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest on record, scientists said in the latest UK State of the Climate report.\nNo other year is in the top 10 on all three criteria.\nThe experts said that, in the space of 30 years, the UK has become 0.9C warmer and 6% wetter.\nThe report's lead author Mike Kendon, climate information scientist at the UK Met Office, told BBC News: \u201cA lot of people think climate change is in the future \u2013 but this proves the climate is already changing here in the UK.\n\u201cAs it continues to warm we are going to see more and more extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods.\u201d \nThe report says the UK has become hotter, sunnier and rainier:\nScientists warn of worse extreme weather if global temperatures rise and politicians fail to curb carbon emissions.  \nAnd in a separate report, scientists warned that greenhouse gas levels were already too high \u201cfor a manageable future for humanity\u201c.\nLiz Bentley, head of the Royal Meteorological Society, said that even if governments could achieve the challenging outcome of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C \u2013 which looks very unlikely - that would still lead to a 10% increase in the amount of water the air can hold.\n\u201cIn the UK,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are likely to see temperatures of 40C. As we get 1.5C warming, that\u2019ll be something we see on a regular basis. \n\"People don\u2019t realise that even a small temperature rise of 0.1 or 0.2 degrees overall can make a huge difference \u2013 especially in the frequency and intensity of extreme events.\n\u201cWe had roads melting last year, rails start to buckle, electric cabling starts to buckle. We often say we\u2019d like a climate like the Med, but people were soon complaining they were too hot - not just in the day but especially at night.\n\u201cIt often takes a massive high-impact event to change attitudes to the climate \u2013 so let\u2019s hope what\u2019s been happening recently with extreme weather will raise the will to tackle the problem.\u201d\nThe State of the Climate report also indicates that plants are responding to the changes in climate. Leaves appeared on average 10.4 days earlier than the 1999-2019 baseline for a range of common shrub and tree species.\nWhile the signs of spring got earlier, so did the indications of autumn - trees in 2020 went bare on average 4.3 days earlier than the baseline.\nThe report also said that, while substantial snow fell in 2018, 2013, 2010 and 2009, the number and severity of such weather events have declined since the 1960s.\nSir James Bevan, the head of the Environment Agency, said there were more than five million homes at risk of flooding in England - and \"that risk is rising as the climate changes\".\n\"We can't remove the risk but we can reduce it,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nHe said the EA's thinking needed to change faster than the climate, and its new strategy was not only about preventing floods, but also making communities more resilient to flooding when it does happen so that it does less damage.\nAnd Sir James said the government has made its biggest investment yet in flood defences, with \u00a35.2bn of funding to be spent on building 2,000 new flood defence schemes over the next six years.\nMeanwhile, a new paper from the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, founded by the former UK chief scientist Prof Sir David King, asks whether rapid heating in the Arctic region is driving changes in the jet stream in a way that influenced the recent weather extremes. \nThe jet stream is a core of strong winds travelling west to east about five to seven miles above the Earth.\nThe new paper said: \"We are simultaneously witnessing weather disaster in Germany, the highest temperatures for June in Finland and the US, the catastrophic heatwave in British Columbia, and extreme heat in Siberia.\n\"These are all outlier events that exceed what one would expect if it were 'only' a 1.2C warming impact (that's the amount the Earth has already warmed since pre-industrial times).\n\"Greenhouse gas levels are already too high for a manageable future for humanity.\"\nThe paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, urges governments to start removing greenhouse gases at scale from the atmosphere.\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

But in May, the BBC reported that rip-off ads for travel visas, driving licences and other documents topped Google search results every time it checked during a 12-month investigation.  \n\"If Google is being user-first, it would be in its users' best interests not to feature these ads and to make sure that the official site for passenger locator forms and other documents come near the top [of any search],\" said Mr Anker.\nOn Sunday, one passenger said Ryanair staff had been warning customers at Hamburg airport after some had paid for the free forms.\nA spokeswoman told the BBC: \"Passenger locator forms should only be downloaded from an official government source or website and are always free of charge.\"\nShe said passengers should \"avoid all non-government websites for such forms\".\nThe UK Home Office said the form was part of its \"enhanced borders regime\" to reduce the risk of new coronavirus variants being transmitted.\n\"The form is free, easy to complete and only available via the gov.uk website,\" a spokeswoman said. \n\"The government does not endorse or recommend any third parties who provide passenger locator form completion services,\" she added.\nIn a statement, Google said: \"We only allow governments or their delegated providers to advertise for official documents or services. \n\"When ads breach our policies we take action to remove them. Last year, our team blocked or removed over 3.1 billion ads for violating our policies.\"\nHowever, on Wednesday, searches for \"passenger locator form\" on Google were still returning the rip-off ads."

      "text": "People who were fully vaccinated in the EU or US will not need to isolate when coming to England, Scotland and Wales from an amber list country.\nThe change will come into force at 04:00 BST on Monday.\nCurrently, only people who received their jabs in the UK can avoid quarantine when arriving from amber list countries, except France.\nThe UK government said the rule change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would apply to people who have been fully vaccinated with a jab approved by the EU or US, with the final dose at least 14 whole days before arrival.\nTravellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive.\nUnder-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age.\nIt come as a further 27,734 cases were reported in the UK, bringing to an end a seven-day run of falling case numbers. Wednesday's case figure was, however, down significantly from a week ago, when 44,104 cases were reported.\nAnother 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.\nTougher rules will continue to be in place for France, which is on the amber list but still requires travellers to quarantine when they return, even if they are fully vaccinated.\nMr Shapps said this advice would be reviewed at \"the end of next week\" as part of the rolling assessment of travel rules.\nAs part of the changes, international cruise ships will be able to depart from England from 2 August - after a 16-month pause.\nScottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the change to the rules would provide \"a boost for the tourism sector and wider economy while ensuring public health is protected\".\nHe added that the change would be \"carefully monitored by clinicians and kept under close review\".\nThe Welsh government said the move posed \"clear public health risks\" - but its shared open border with England made it \"ineffective\" to have different arrangements. \nWelsh health minister Eluned Morgan said vaccines would reduce the risks but only if they were effective against any new variants of concern and cautioned against international travel for non-essential reasons this summer.\nIn Northern Ireland, people vaccinated in the UK and travelling from amber list countries have not needed to self-isolate since 19 July, subject to testing.\nThe Stormont Executive is set to consider the policy of allowing those vaccinated in the US and EU to enter Northern Ireland without quarantine on Thursday.\nAirlines UK, which represents big carriers, said the move would offer \"a lifeline for thousands of businesses reliant on international inbound travel\".\nJoss Croft, of trade association UKinbound, said it would \"allow the \u00a328bn inbound tourism sector, which supports over 500,000 jobs across the UK, to finally restart\".\nAlthough US citizens will soon be able to avoid quarantine in England, Scotland and Wales, they are being urged not to travel to the UK by their country's health protection agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nAnd the US border is currently closed to the UK, as well as many other countries, except for US citizens.\nThe UK and US have set up a taskforce to discuss a travel corridor, although earlier this week the White House said it had no plans to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans.\nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson told LBC on Wednesday that \"we're talking to them the whole time\".\nFor 70-year-old Patricia Duncan in Spain, the changes will mean she can travel to England and be on hand to support her daughter ahead of an operation - without needing to isolate.\n\"I have another friend with mental health issues who is desperate for me to visit,\" she says.\n\"Normally I travel three or four times a year to see my family and friends, and it's been a long time. So I'm very glad that is happening.\"\nBut Fiona Clarke in Portugal says the cost of Covid testing is still a barrier for her to visit family in Brighton.\n\"I think we'll look very carefully, we'll wait and see what happens with the testing,\" she says.\nLabour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she had \"real concerns\" over the plan. \"Each individual US state does things differently,\" she said. \"They don't have a National Health Service that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications.\n\"So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it.\""

      "text": "The RNLI says it has been \"overwhelmed\" by a \"huge level of support\" following accusations its work is assisting migrants. \nThe lifeboat charity received over \u00a3200,000 in donations in 24 hours after it posted rescue footage on social media.\nThe former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, said it was being used as a \"taxi service for illegal trafficking gangs\".\nDowning Street has praised its \"vital work\". \nThe charity said in the same 24 hour period there had been a 270% increase in people viewing volunteering opportunities on its website. It would normally receive up to \u00a37,000 in daily donations.\nIt follows an outpouring of support after the head of the organisation spoke out on Wednesday about volunteers facing verbal abuse from members of the public for bringing migrants to safety.\nThe organisation has found itself in the spotlight as the number of people crossing the Channel has been rising, with this year's total already above the whole of 2020's, and June setting a new monthly record.\nOn Sunday, 378 migrants made the crossing on 12 boats and the French are understood to have stopped 178 people in five interceptions.\nChief executive Mark Dowie said he recognised the migrant crisis was a \"polarising issue\", but lifeboat crews carry out \"humanitarian work of the highest order\".\nHe said: \"All decent people will see this as humanitarian work of the highest order\" and \"crews should not have to put up with some of the abuse they received.\"\nIn a statement on Thursday, the RNLI said the surge in donations in the last 24 hours was \"simply incredible\". It said it had benefited from a combination of one off donations, new regular support and supporters increasing their regular donation amount. \n\"This was never a fundraising campaign - we simply wanted to tell the story of our crews and make it clear that our charity exists to save lives at sea.\n\"Our mission is to save everyone. Our supporters' kindness means so much to us, without them we could not save lives at sea, every one is a lifesaver.\"\nBut it said it also recognised that \"people have strong opinions on the subject\" and that a \"small number\" of supporters had been in contact to withdraw their support. \nEarlier, in an interview on LBC, Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, praised the charity's work, saying they \"do an incredible job, they have got this great heart and soul to them\".\nHe added: \"I think they operate within the legal rules and that is part of this country. \n\"We are a big-hearted country. \n\"At the same time, if we are talking about the wider small boats issue, that is something where, absolutely at the same time, we need to come down as hard as is humanly possible, working with our French partners.\"\nMr Raab said it was not \"inconsistent\" to have a \"robust approach\" to \"criminal gangs trying to launch from France to the UK\" and at the same time, ministers valuing the \"heart and soul\" of the RNLI.\nThe Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, tweeted that he had made a donation and wanted to thank the charity \"for all that you do\".\nDowning Street said the organisation does \"vital work to protect people's lives at sea\". \nThe prime minister's spokesman said the government was committed to tackling the issue of small boats crossing the channel. \n\"This rise is dangerous and unnecessary which is why we're working to tackle the issue and the gangs behind it,\" the spokesman said."

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Employment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of people on furlough has fallen sharply, with young people moving off the government scheme fastest, new figures show.\nAt the end of June, 1.9 million people were still on furlough, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and half a million fewer than in May.\nIn the last three months, younger people came off furlough twice as fast as all other age brackets. \nAlmost 600,000 under-25s had left the scheme in that time, the Treasury said.\nAt the same time, more than a million people in hospitality and retail have left the scheme.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the latest figures, saying they showed the government's policies were working.\nAt the peak of the pandemic in May last year, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nThe wage support scheme has been extended several times, but will end on 30 September. \nLucy Walker-Evans from Chepstow was working as an account manager for a global hotel chain when she was put on furlough in March last year.\nThe 45-year-old spent the next nine months on paid leave, a time she found harrowing at first.\n\"It felt like you were skiving off work, you kept waiting for the phone to ring, constantly felt guilty,\" she told the BBC. \n\"There was lots of crying, lots of worry, lots of uncertainty.\" \nIn January, she was made redundant, but the time off had given her a chance to take stock. \nShe realised she wanted a less stressful job and to work in charity, and by February she had managed to find a role working at a local shelter for young homeless people - a job she loves. \n\"Had I not been furloughed, I would never have had time to think about my career, so it was a transformational experience really,\" she told the BBC. \n\"I also had a year to learn to live on a lower salary - you realise you don't always need to chase the next pay rise.\" \nJo Shippen, managing director of Hatters Promotions, a promotional merchandise and print company in Stockport, said the furlough scheme had been a \"godsend\" for her business and staff.\n\"Without the furlough scheme, I would have to have let people go, I just would not have managed,\" she said.\n\"I know for a fact I would not have been able to run my business. I would not have been able to embrace the change and I would not have been able to adapt in the way we have adapted.\"\nHatters was able to continue operating during the lockdowns, but it \"pivoted\" away from events and conferences to supplying products for companies looking to improve staff engagement.\nMs Shippen said she had been \"really lucky\" that her staff were \"understanding\" about being furloughed.\nUnder the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), known as furlough, staff receive 80% of their current salary, capped at \u00a32,500 a month.\nFurlough will be wound down further from Sunday as the government asks firms to make a bigger contribution. \nSince 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers for hours their staff do not work. \nThat amount will rise to to 20% in August and September.\nThe scheme, drawn up after lengthy talks with business groups and union leaders, has cost taxpayers almost \u00a350bn to date, arousing fears taxes will have to rise to pay for it.\nSince the start of the scheme, a cumulative total of 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the CJRS at various times.\nIt is credited with stopping a spike in unemployment and some fear jobs will be lost when it ends. \nBut according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, the number of people on furlough has been \"dropping like a stone\" as industries start to reopen, while fears of a \"rush of redundancies\" have been unfounded.\n\"Either employees are being brought back to work by their employers or they are being taken off furlough and leaving the labour market,\" Mr Wilson told the BBC. \n\"That could be young people going into full-time education rather than seeking work.\"\nHowever, he noted some industries would be more exposed than others when the scheme finally ends, while support jobs such as office cleaning, security and delivery could also be lost if workers do not go back to the office in the same numbers because of the rise in home working. \n\"The answer is not extending furlough, but re-skilling people to take up the record number of new vacancies being advertised,\" Mr Wilson said. \nThe top five industry groups with the highest rates of jobs being put on furlough at 31 May 2021: \nSource: ONS\nTom Waters, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there was \"no way to know exactly\" how many jobs would have been lost, and for how long, had the furlough scheme not existed.\n\"But given that unemployment has only risen slightly since the start of the pandemic, despite the biggest fall in GDP ever recorded, I think it's fair to say that furlough has had a very significant impact on job retention,\" he added.\nThe Trades Union Congress said it was \"great\" so many people had been able to return to work from furlough, but added some firms still required it.\n\"Doubling the employer contribution is too much too soon, putting jobs at risk in some parts of the economy,\" said Frances O'Grady, the union's general secretary. \nLaura Kearsley, head of employment law at Nelsons Solicitors, believes a lot of employers will review their workforce in the light of the furlough support being removed.

      "text": "A British man who went to Syria to join the Islamic State (IS) group has admitted sharing beheading videos.\nStefan Aristidou, 27, entered guilty pleas to four terrorism offences at the Old Bailey and will be sentenced in September.\nBBC research reveals he is the 14th person convicted of terror charges out of hundreds who returned from Syria after joining jihadist groups.\nThe research shows only 3% of returnees have been convicted of such offences.\nAristidou, from Enfield in north London, travelled to Syria in April 2015 with Kolsoma Begum, whom he had married shortly before. \nThe pair were reported missing by concerned family members. \nAristidou, who is of Cypriot origin, is a convert to Islam.\nThe couple spent time living in Raqqa - then the \"capital\" of Islamic State's self-declared caliphate - and had a baby while living in Syria.\nThey were later arrested crossing into Turkey in April 2017.\nBoth were convicted in a Turkish court in October 2018 of being part of IS.\nThey were each sentenced to more than six years in prison, although Kolsoma Begum was convicted in her absence having already been returned to the UK with their child.\nAristidou was deported in February this year and arrested on arrival at Heathrow airport.\nHe had a phone with him which had not been used since before his arrest in Turkey in April 2017.\nIt contained text exchanges with his wife, ending with him saying he was \"giving self into Kuffar\" - or non-Muslims.\nThe four offences Aristidou has now admitted were committed in 2014 before he went to Syria, when he had sent other people IS videos depicting public executions and beheadings.\nHe pleaded not guilty to three similar offences and prosecutors will ask for these charges to be left to lie on file.\nThe case highlights the challenge of prosecuting people for their actions in Syria.\nThe government has previously said more than 900 people from the UK went to Syria to join jihadist groups.\nA senior MI5 official said this year that about half have since returned to the UK, equating to about 450 people.\nThe government has given shifting figures to Parliament on the number of returnees prosecuted:\nThe government has never confirmed how many of these people have actually been prosecuted for terror offences. \nLast year, in response to a freedom of information request from the BBC, the Home Office said it \"does not hold the information\".\nThe CPS also says it does not have the figures.\nHowever, research by the BBC which has examined all recent terrorism prosecutions, has found that only 14 people who crossed into Syria have been convicted of terror offences after returning to Britain.\nThe first case was in 2014, with Aristidou the most recent.\nThe figures mean that approximately 3% of 450 returnees have been convicted of terror offences.\nFive people in total have been convicted of IS membership, but only two of them are returnees from Syria. \nThe other three people had joined the group in the UK, meaning individuals are more likely to be charged with IS membership if they never went to Syria.\nSeparately, four people who fought against IS with the Kurdish YPG militia were charged with terror offences after returning to Britain.\nThe number who went to join the YPG has been placed as low as 30, suggesting a higher proportion of YPG fighters were charged with terror offences despite receiving western military support in their campaign against IS.\nNo one who returned to the UK after joining jihadist groups has been charged with offences under war crimes or torture legislation, which provide an avenue of prosecution for crimes committed outside UK borders."

      "text": "Amazon has predicted slower sales growth in the third quarter as a boost from the Covid pandemic subsides.\nCustomers turned to Amazon and other online platforms during the Covid crisis, leading to record profits for the US giant.\nBut Amazon's breakneck growth is beginning to level as customers start to return to bricks and mortar shops.\nRevenue climbed 27% to $113bn (\u00a381bn) in its second quarter, but this missed analysts' expectations.\nAmazon shares fell more than 7% in after-hours trade.\nEarlier in the Covid pandemic Amazon posted record profits, signed up more than 200 million customers to its Prime service, and recruited more than 500,000 workers to keep up with surging demand.\nBut vaccine rollouts and easing of restrictions have led some consumers to venture out to stores, while also using click-and-collect services, in competition with the speedy delivery of online orders provided by Amazon and its peers.\nAmazon's net sales rose to $113.08bn in the second quarter to 30 June from $88.91bn in the same period a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $115.20bn.\nThe world's biggest online retailer had moved its annual marketing bonanza, Prime Day, to June this year, hoping to sell more goods before shoppers went on holiday.\nIt said the event was the biggest two-day sales period ever for merchants on its platform.\nBut in the second quarter analysts have seen signs of slowing demand.\nNorth America, Amazon's largest market, saw sales increase 22% in the second quarter, versus 43% in the same period a year earlier.\nBut profit rose 48% to $7.8bn, the second-largest quarterly result Amazon has ever announced.\nThe retail giant's founder Jeff Bezos stepped down as chief executive on 5 July, becoming executive chair of Amazon's board.\nAndy Jassy took on role, after previously being in charge of Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the second quarter AWS was a bright spot, seeing revenue rise by 37% to $14.8bn.\nMr Jassy said: \"Over the past 18 months, our consumer business has been called on to deliver an unprecedented number of items, including PPE [personal protective equipment], food, and other products that helped communities around the world cope with the difficult circumstances of the pandemic.\n\"At the same time, AWS has helped so many businesses and governments maintain business continuity, and we've seen AWS growth reaccelerate as more companies bring forward plans to transform their businesses and move to the cloud.\" \nAmazon's are the latest results from Big Tech this week. Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent firm Alphabet all reported soaring profits as the Covid pandemic continues. Facebook, however, said that it expects revenue growth to slow.\nNicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"It's saying something when you can report quarterly sales roughly equal to the annual GDP of Ukraine and 33% operating profit growth and still disappoint the market.\n\"You can see why Jeff Bezos would rather be jetting off into space. \n\"In all seriousness though, Amazon is increasingly bumping up against the law of large numbers - particularly in US retail.\n\"When you're only selling $1,000 of product a year, boosting sales by 40% is easy. When your annualised sales reach $400bn, finding an extra $160bn of sales is pretty difficult.\"\nMr Hyett said that means that Amazon is having to spend a lot to deliver future growth.\n\"The group's got plenty of irons in the fire for the future, it just needs to hope one of them comes off big,\" he added.\nThe top job that Mr Jassy inherited has never been bigger and more complex.\nLast quarter Amazon, the biggest online retailer in the world, announced a deal to buy the film studio MGM for $8.5bn, expanding in Hollywood at the same time as it is running a grocery chain, building a healthcare business and facing scrutiny from regulators worldwide.\nCosts also continue to rise. The company has offered an average $17 in hourly wages - more than double the US minimum - plus signing bonuses to attract 75,000 workers during a labour shortage."

      "tags": "Television,Doctor Who",
      "text": "Jodie Whittaker is to step down from the lead role in Doctor Who, the BBC has confirmed.\nThe first woman to play the Time Lord will bow out in Autumn 2022, along with showrunner Chris Chibnall.\nWhittaker will star in a new six-part series later this year, and three specials next year, before she exits.\nIn a statement, Whittaker paid tribute to Chibnall and the Doctor Who team, adding: \"I will carry the Doctor and the lessons I've learnt forever.\"\nChibnall, who appointed the actress to replace Peter Capaldi in the role, has been in charge of the BBC One series since 2017.\nIt has not yet been announced who will take over from Whittaker in the leading role.\n\"In 2017 I opened my glorious gift box of size 13 shoes,\" Whittaker said in a statement. \"I could not have guessed the brilliant adventures, worlds and wonders I was to see in them.\"\nShe continued: \"My heart is so full of love for this show, for the team who make it, for the fans who watch it and for what it has brought to my life.\"\n\"And I cannot thank Chris enough for entrusting me with his incredible stories. We knew that we wanted to ride this wave side by side, and pass on the baton together. So here we are, weeks away from wrapping on the best job I have ever had. I don't think I'll ever be able to express what this role has given me. I will carry the Doctor and the lessons I've learnt forever. \n\"I know change can be scary and none of us know what's out there. That's why we keep looking. Travel hopefully. The universe will surprise you. Constantly.\"\nFor her final series, Whittaker will once again be joined by Mandip Gill as Yaz, and comedian John Bishop, who will play a new character named Dan.\nThe 13th Doctor's first episode in October 2018 was watched by 11.5m viewers, in the sci-fi drama's biggest audience for almost a decade. It was also the biggest show of that week, ahead of Strictly Come Dancing and the Great British Bake Off. \nBut the show's ratings have dropped in recent years. Whittaker's last episode, broadcast in January, attracted a consolidated audience of 6.3 million.\nWhile many have praised Whittaker's casting, some fans and critics have criticised the show's recent narrative direction.\nThe Telegraph described recent episodes as \"flat, worthy and woke\" despite Whittaker's talent as an actress, while The Sun reported viewers were left furious by the show's \"unbearable political correctness\".\nOne of the long-running drama's unique features has been regeneration, where the Doctor completely changes their physical appearance, allowing the show to recast its lead role every few years.\nChibnall is currently writing and producing the next series of Doctor Who, which will air later this year. It will be followed by three specials, the first of which will be broadcast on New Year's Day 2022, with another later in spring 2022. \nWhittaker's final feature-length special, where the 13th Doctor will regenerate, will transmit in autumn 2022 as part of the BBC's Centenary celebrations.\nSpeculation will now turn to who Whittaker's replacement might be, as Doctor Who approaches its 60th anniversary in 2023.\nAs well as introducing Whittaker as the first female Doctor, Chibnall also brought in Tosin Cole as Ryan, Mandip Gill (Yaz) and Bradley Walsh (Graham).\nEpisodes such as Rosa, Demons of the Punjab and Spyfall thrilled audiences, and netted the show two Bafta Must See Moment nominations, along with multiple National Television Award, Bafta Cymru, TV Choice and Critics Choice nominations.\nIn 2020, Whittaker was voted second most popular Doctor of all-time in a poll of 50,000 fans for the Radio Times, losing out to David Tennant.\nChibnall said: \"Jodie and I made a 'three series and out' pact with each other at the start of this once-in-a-lifetime blast. So now our shift is done, and we're handing back the Tardis keys. \n\"Jodie's magnificent, iconic Doctor has exceeded all our high expectations. She's been the gold standard leading actor, shouldering the responsibility of being the first female Doctor with style, strength, warmth, generosity and humour.\"\nHe added: \"She captured the public imagination and continues to inspire adoration around the world, as well as from everyone on the production.\n\"I can't imagine working with a more inspiring Doctor - so I'm not going to!\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "People who were fully vaccinated in the EU or US will not need to isolate when coming to England, Scotland and Wales from an amber list country.\nThe change will come into force at 04:00 BST on Monday.\nCurrently, only people who received their jabs in the UK can avoid quarantine when arriving from amber list countries, except France.\nThe UK government said the rule change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would apply to people who have been fully vaccinated with a jab approved by the EU or US, with the final dose at least 14 whole days before arrival.\nTravellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive.\nUnder-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age.\nIt come as a further 27,734 cases were reported in the UK, bringing to an end a seven-day run of falling case numbers. Wednesday's case figure was, however, down significantly from a week ago, when 44,104 cases were reported.\nAnother 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.\nTougher rules will continue to be in place for France, which is on the amber list but still requires travellers to quarantine when they return, even if they are fully vaccinated.\nMr Shapps said this advice would be reviewed at \"the end of next week\" as part of the rolling assessment of travel rules.\nAs part of the changes, international cruise ships will be able to depart from England from 2 August - after a 16-month pause.\nScottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the change to the rules would provide \"a boost for the tourism sector and wider economy while ensuring public health is protected\".\nHe added that the change would be \"carefully monitored by clinicians and kept under close review\".\nThe Welsh government said the move posed \"clear public health risks\" - but its shared open border with England made it \"ineffective\" to have different arrangements. \nWelsh health minister Eluned Morgan said vaccines would reduce the risks but only if they were effective against any new variants of concern and cautioned against international travel for non-essential reasons this summer.\nIn Northern Ireland, people vaccinated in the UK and travelling from amber list countries have not needed to self-isolate since 19 July, subject to testing.\nThe Stormont Executive is set to consider the policy of allowing those vaccinated in the US and EU to enter Northern Ireland without quarantine on Thursday.\nAirlines UK, which represents big carriers, said the move would offer \"a lifeline for thousands of businesses reliant on international inbound travel\".\nJoss Croft, of trade association UKinbound, said it would \"allow the \u00a328bn inbound tourism sector, which supports over 500,000 jobs across the UK, to finally restart\".\nAlthough US citizens will soon be able to avoid quarantine in England, Scotland and Wales, they are being urged not to travel to the UK by their country's health protection agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nAnd the US border is currently closed to the UK, as well as many other countries, except for US citizens.\nThe UK and US have set up a taskforce to discuss a travel corridor, although earlier this week the White House said it had no plans to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans.\nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson told LBC on Wednesday that \"we're talking to them the whole time\".\nFor 70-year-old Patricia Duncan in Spain, the changes will mean she can travel to England and be on hand to support her daughter ahead of an operation - without needing to isolate.\n\"I have another friend with mental health issues who is desperate for me to visit,\" she says.\n\"Normally I travel three or four times a year to see my family and friends, and it's been a long time. So I'm very glad that is happening.\"\nBut Fiona Clarke in Portugal says the cost of Covid testing is still a barrier for her to visit family in Brighton.\n\"I think we'll look very carefully, we'll wait and see what happens with the testing,\" she says.\nLabour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she had \"real concerns\" over the plan. \"Each individual US state does things differently,\" she said. \"They don't have a National Health Service that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications.\n\"So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it.\""

But in May, the BBC reported that rip-off ads for travel visas, driving licences and other documents topped Google search results every time it checked during a 12-month investigation.  \n\"If Google is being user-first, it would be in its users' best interests not to feature these ads and to make sure that the official site for passenger locator forms and other documents come near the top [of any search],\" said Mr Anker.\nOn Sunday, one passenger said Ryanair staff had been warning customers at Hamburg airport after some had paid for the free forms.\nA spokeswoman told the BBC: \"Passenger locator forms should only be downloaded from an official government source or website and are always free of charge.\"\nShe said passengers should \"avoid all non-government websites for such forms\".\nThe UK Home Office said the form was part of its \"enhanced borders regime\" to reduce the risk of new coronavirus variants being transmitted.\n\"The form is free, easy to complete and only available via the gov.uk website,\" a spokeswoman said. \n\"The government does not endorse or recommend any third parties who provide passenger locator form completion services,\" she added.\nIn a statement, Google said: \"We only allow governments or their delegated providers to advertise for official documents or services. \n\"When ads breach our policies we take action to remove them.

He was also fined 3.11 million yuan ($478,697; \u00a3343,227).\nSun's company is among China's biggest, with businesses ranging from meat processing and pet food to schools and hospitals.\nHe was reportedly detained last year, along with 20 relatives and business associates, over a land dispute with a government-run farm. \nAt the time, he said dozens of his employees were injured in an incident with police related to the dispute, according to an AFP report. \nSun is said to be close to some prominent Chinese political dissidents and has in the past criticised the government's rural policies.  \nHe was one of the few people to openly accuse the government of covering up an African swine flu outbreak, which affected his farms in 2019, and later devastated much of the country's industry.\nHe also was sentenced to prison in 2003, for \"illegal fundraising\" but the case was overturned after an outpouring of support from activists and the public.\nSun reportedly denied many of the accusations against him in a pre-trial hearing, describing himself as an \"outstanding Communist party member\".\nHe did however reportedly admit to making mistakes, including posting messages online.\n\"The way they're investigating me now is making those close to us suffer and those who hate us rejoice. I wish to take the charges upon myself, even if they're severe, in exchange for the release of others. We are people who have made contributions to society,\" he said.\nChina has been cracking down on businesses and entrepreneurs in the country.

      "text": "UK car production is still much lower than it needs to be due to shortages of staff and semiconductors, the industry is warning.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said just 69,097 cars were produced in June, the lowest since 1953, with the exception of last year.\nThe trade body is calling for urgent assistance to exempt staff pinged by the NHS Covid app.\nSMMT said the industry was \"desperately trying to get back to full capacity\".\nThe picture \"didn't look particularly pretty\", the SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes said, even though production numbers were up on June 2020, just after the first coronavirus lockdown ended. \n\"We were expecting to make just over 1.05 million cars this year, but due to semiconductor shortages and other issues, we will be about 100,000 cars lower,\" he said.\n\"It's difficult to give a picture of the whole industry, but anecdotally, some companies have between 5-30% of staff away self-isolating.\"\nIdeally, the UK car industry needed to get back to producing between 1.2 million to 1.3 million vehicles a year, Mr Hawes added. \nUK car plants turned out 498,923 cars in the first half of 2021, 38.4% lower than the five-year average. This is equivalent to losses of about \u00a38.5bn, the SMMT said.\nSome firms had resorted to reducing shifts, but the true impact of the staff shortages would not be felt until the annual car plant summer shutdowns ended, it added.\nThe SMMT is calling on the government to bring forward the 16 August target date for exempting fully vaccinated adults from self-isolation, as well as introducing a \"test to release\" scheme to support those employees not yet fully vaccinated.\n\"If it can't be brought forward, what we need to know is, if you took a PCR test two to three days before 16 August, would it count?\" said Mr Hawes.\nThere was plenty of demand for UK car exports, he added, but key issues for the industry included \"friction\" at the borders as a result of Brexit and rising logistics costs due to the pandemic.\nHe said companies also felt consumers would only be persuaded to switch to electric cars if the charging infrastructure was there to support them.\nMr Hawes said it was \"still a very difficult time for the industry\", and that the impact of the global semiconductor shortage was likely to last into 2022.\nSemiconductor makers cut production during lockdowns because \"it was unclear how long the European markets would be closed for [but] the shutdowns were not as long as anticipated\", Mr Hawes explained. \n\"Some of the countries that produce them now have rising Covid cases so we don't know how that will affect production going forward.\" \nWell, the figures are better than last year's at least - but considering how badly the industry was affected by lockdowns last year, that really isn't saying very much.\nDemand isn't the problem. The bulk of UK-built cars are sold overseas, and manufacturers say there's plenty of appetite for them. But two issues, both linked to the pandemic, have got in the way of the recovery: the global semiconductor shortage and the shortage of staff resulting from the so-called 'pingdemic'.\nUltimately, though, these are relatively short-term problems, and the industry will get over them. The bigger issue for UK car manufacturing is how to attract new investment.\nWith governments in the UK and in Europe making plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars within a few years, the race is on to replace the production lines that will soon become obsolete.\nThe hiatus caused by Brexit meant manufacturers were reluctant to commit to the UK, just as the electric cars revolution was taking shape. Now, with new investments announced at Nissan and Vauxhall, the situation has changed. \nBut with other countries such as Germany having gone further, faster, the UK still has a lot to do to stake its claim to a significant share of the future electric car industry."

      "text": "The number of empty shops in Britain has continued to rise as retailers struggle with the effects of the Covid pandemic, the British Retail Consortium has said.\nShopping centres have been hardest hit, with nearly one in five units empty, the industry group said.\nThe north east of England had the highest vacancy rate, followed by Wales and the north west.\nThe Covid pandemic has accelerated a shift towards online shopping.\nMany shops were shuttered during lockdowns, although retail sales in June were near pre-lockdown levels, as the reopening of shops released pent-up demand.\nHowever, fashion retailers have been hit hard by the pandemic, with the closure of well-known High Street brands such as Debenhams and Topshop contributing to vacancies.\nBut it is shopping centres which had the highest vacancy rate from April to June.\n\"It comes as no surprise that the number of shuttered stores in the UK continues to rise, after retailers have been in and out of lockdown for over a year,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC).\nAlmost one in five shopping centre units now lie empty, and more than one in eight units have been empty for more than a year. \nThe vacancy rate in retail parks is also rising quickly as they lose stores.\nThe number of empty shops could continue to rise following the ending of the business rates holiday, Ms Dickinson said.\nSince the start of the pandemic, the government announced a range of measures to help companies including business rates relief which ran until the end of June. Firms are currently paying a reduced rate.\nBut Tony Brown, chief executive of Beales, the department store, told the BBC's Today programme that the resumption of full business rates payments \"is a sword of Damocles hanging over everybody\".\nHe said that at Beales stores, which include Poole, Peterborough and the soon-to-open branch in Southport, \"we pay 10 times, sometimes 30 times more in [business] rates than we do in rent\".\nBeales, one of the UK's oldest department stores, fell into administration in January 2020 before the Covid pandemic was declared. It subsequently shut down all its shops but a business called New Start 2020 bought the name and Beales reopened a branch in Poole last year.\nMr Brown said: \"The pandemic has allowed us to rethink the model as to how department stores should work and how we can rebuild the High Streets.\n\"I believe that customers still want to shop, still want to physically shop in stores, especially for fashions, and as we get further and further away from the pandemic, being able to try on clothes comfortably is what the customers are asking us to do.\"\nThe BRC's Ms Dickinson said that there is a sharp divide between the south of England, including London, with lower vacancy rates compared to the north of the country, where disposable income is lower.\nWhile the increase in the vacancy rate is slowing, there \"will never be enough demand to meet the supply\" said Lucy Stainton, director of Local Data Company, which did the vacancy research for the BRC.\n\"The property market will be forced to think of more creative ways to utilise this space, to avoid exacerbating the already high rates of long-term voids across our retail destinations which are not only unsightly and costly for landlords, but also have a negative impact on surrounding stores,\" she said.\nThe BRC envisages future town centres to include leisure, retail centres, services and homes."

      "tags": "Liverpool",
      "text": "A Liverpool fan who suffered life-changing injuries in the Hillsborough disaster has died.\nAndrew Devine, 55, died on Tuesday, his family said in a statement released by Liverpool FC.\nIt added: \"Our collective devastation is overwhelming but so too is the realisation that we were blessed to have had Andrew with us for 32 years.\"\nNinety-six other people died due to the crush at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in 1989.\nMr Devine was described by his family as a \"much-loved son, brother and uncle\" who had been supported by his family and a team of dedicated carers.\n\"We welcome the conclusion of the coroner, Mr Andre Rebello, made today at Liverpool Coroner's Court, that Andrew was unlawfully killed, making him the 97th fatality of the tragic events that occurred on April 15, 1989,\" they added.\nIn 2016, an inquest jury ruled 96 Liverpool fans had been unlawfully killed in the Hillsborough disaster.\nUntil Mr Devine's death, the last of the victims had been Tony Bland, who was left severely brain damaged by the crush at the stadium but lived until 1993.\nLiverpool said the club was \"deeply saddened\" by his death.\n\"A lifelong Liverpool supporter, Andrew continued to attend matches at Anfield when possible despite suffering life-changing injuries at Hillsborough,\" their statement added.\n\"In doing so he defied expectations that he would not survive for six months after the tragedy.\n\"The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Andrew's family and his carers.\"\nPeople from across the city have been paying tribute to Mr Devine, including former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher.\nLiverpool vice-captain James Milner paid a moving tribute to Mr Devine in 2019 when the club won the Champions League.\nAs the open-top bus came to the end of its victory parade through the city, the midfielder requested that it stop outside Mr Devine's home, the Liverpool Echo reported at the time.\nMr Devine was outside and able to watch as Milner leaned over the side of the bus to show him the trophy.\nIn a 2014 interview, his family told the Echo that Mr Devine was a popular 22-year-old training for a career in accountancy when he was crushed in the crowd in 1989 and starved of oxygen, with doctors initially saying he was unlikely to survive the day.\nHis sister Wendy said he was \"the centre of the family and the glue that holds us together\".\nThe 2016 inquest was a turning point in the official response to the disaster, which had previously been marked by a police cover-up aimed at unjustly blaming Liverpool fans.\nTwo police forces agreed earlier this year to pay damages to 600 people over the cover-up, but nobody has ever been convicted over police actions following the stadium crush.\nThe Hillsborough disaster remains the UK's worst sporting tragedy and led to a transformation of safety standards for football crowds, including the move to all-seater stadiums.\nIt occurred when a large crowd built up outside the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of Sheffield Wednesday's stadium and police ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve the pressure.\nThat led 2,000 Liverpool fans to enter via a tunnel on to already-packed terraces, creating a severe crush in the central pens.\nMatch commander Ch Supt David Duckenfield falsely told key people and the media that a gate had been forced by Liverpool fans - which families and survivors of the tragedy fought for years to disprove.\nMr Duckenfield was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter at a retrial in 2019, after the jury in his first trial was unable to reach a verdict.\nA trial of two retired police officers and a former solicitor, accused of perverting the course of justice by altering police statements after the disaster, collapsed when a judge ruled there was no case to answer.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus testing,Hospitality industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 600,000 people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts in the week between 8 and 15 July.\nAnd about one in five hospitality workers are isolating.\nIt's caused staff shortages in lots of industries, including the hospitality sector which employs over three million people.\nWith whole teams being \"pinged\" at once, pubs, restaurants and hotels have been forced to temporarily shut, pushing some hospitality staff to delete the app.\nRachael tells Radio 1 Newsbeat isolating has cost her between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400 in missed shifts.\nThe 22-year-old who lives in Brighton and, until two weeks ago, worked in a bar explains: \"I've been pinged twice while on my way to shifts.\n\"Both times I've tested negative on lateral flows and PCRs. I don't agree with not self-isolating, but the app gives you no context on who you've been near.\"\nAlthough isolating after being pinged isn't a legal requirement, the government urges people to do so.\nIn a recent interview, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC: \"If you are pinged, you should self-isolate. I know it poses challenges but the rules are clear and I think they should be followed.\"\nRachael says a big factor in deleting the app was a lack of sick pay. \"If I'm off, I get no income or support. If I did I would self-isolate.\"\nFrustrated by a lack of earnings, she spoke to her manager about ending one of her isolations early.\n\"I asked my boss, 'If I got a test today, and it's negative, can I work?'\n\"He said no because the head office was being strict, but in our staff WhatsApp chat he later messaged to say people should delete the app because they're losing so many staff.\"\nRachael agrees with her boss and wanted to delete the app.\nRalph (not his real name) can relate to this pressure. He's 27, works in a bar in London and has been told to delete the app, although he's decided to go against his manager.\n\"Having the app is the right thing to do and whether or not I've got a manager telling me to have it, I'm going to keep it,\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nRalph has also been told to ignore being pinged, even after doing a shift with a colleague who tested positive.\n\"The app said I needed to isolate for 8 days, so I told my manager straightaway. He said to come in, take one lateral flow test and if that's negative to continue working.\"\nRalph describes the situation as \"worrying\", and although he understands why his manager needs him in, decided to \"put his foot down.\"\n\"The worst case scenario is I'm positive, I go into work and spread it to staff and customers and that effectively puts people's lives at risk and that's something I'm not comfortable doing.\"\nLike Rachael, Ralph isn't paid if he doesn't go to work. On the whole he says he feels safe when he's there, but questions some of the bar's policies.\n\"My manager asks us all to wear 'exempt' badges because he doesn't want us wearing masks. I understand he wants to create a relaxed atmosphere for customers, but we're still in a pandemic.\"\nFor Lucy, a 24-year-old bar supervisor in London, her workplace does feel safe. They follow social distancing rules, and all customers check into the venue.\nHowever like Ralph, she's been told to delete her app. She says \"keeping it wasn't an option\".\n\"There wasn't a conversation about it, which from a safety point, I don't really agree with. I felt like my safety was compromised.\"\nTwo weeks ago Lucy and three other members of staff contracted Covid. Their manager asked them not to enter the positive tests into the NHS app as he worried it could shut the bar down.\n\"I felt a bit awkward. It's not about me and my workplace, it's also about the places I've been outside of work.\n\"I could be putting other people at risk. Ethically and morally it didn't sit with me very well.\"\nSo if like Lucy and Ralph you want to keep the app, what are your rights in the workplace?\nBeth Hale is a lawyer who specialises in employment. She tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, it all comes down to judgement.\nShe explains: \"An employee is obliged to follow reasonable instructions.\n\"A blanket instruction that all staff should delete the app is unlikely to be reasonable.\"\nIf you are told to delete the app against your will, Beth suggests \"having a rational conversation\".\n\"Part of the problem is the confusion there is between the NHS Test and Trace system and the NHS app. With the app, there is no legal obligation to have it and it does not create a legal obligation to self-isolate. Being contacted by NHS test and trace however does create a legal obligation.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

They did not give further details.\nEarlier in July, ZZ Top had announced that Hill would not play some upcoming shows due to a hip injury.\nKnown for his bushy beard and sunglasses, Hill played with ZZ Top for over 50 years.\n\"We, along with legions of ZZ Top fans around the world, will miss your steadfast presence, your good nature, and enduring commitment to providing that monumental bottom to the 'Top',\" the statement from Gibbons and Beard said.\n\"You will be missed greatly, amigo.\"\nBorn Joseph Michael Hill, the bassist originally played guitar alongside his brother Rocky in Dallas before moving to Houston and joining Beard.\nZZ Top was founded in 1969, and played their first live concert the following year.\nThe trio would go on to release 15 studio and four live albums, with hit singles like Gimme All Your Lovin', Sleeping Bag, and Viva Las Vegas.\nZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.\nIn addition to the bass guitar, Hill played keyboard and was a secondary lead vocalist for the band. \nHill also made cameo acting appearances in the Back to the Future Part III film and HBO's Deadwood, along with the animated television series King of the Hill.\nFollowing news of his death, fans and fellow musicians of Hill's took to social media to express their grief.\n\"For 50 entire years, Dusty Hill anchored down one of the greatest rock power trios that's ever existed,\" music journalist Corbin Reiff wrote on Twitter."

      "text": "A draft law in the Scottish Parliament was amended to exempt the Queen's land from measures to encourage green energy after her lawyers raised \"concerns\".\nThe changes meant land owned by the royal household could not be subject to compulsory purchase orders without the monarch's approval.\nThe correspondence between Buckingham Palace and the Scottish government was first reported in The Guardian.\nBuckingham Palace insisted the process did not alter the nature of any laws.\nBut Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said such lobbying - details of which were revealed in a Freedom of Information request by a party researcher - should have been declared.\nThe Heat Networks Bill encouraged the use of underground pipes to heat homes and buildings rather than boilers powered by fossil fuels.\nThe documents show correspondence took place between the Scottish government and Buckingham Palace around the procedure known as Queen's consent, where the monarch is given sight of legislation which affects her interests.\nThe concerns centred on the potential use of compulsory purchase orders - a legal process by which land or property can be obtained, for instance for major infrastructure projects, without the the consent of the owner if deemed in the greater public interest.\nQueen's consent for the Heat Networks Bill was sought in January this year, the documents show, though the content of many exchanges was redacted.\nIn February, officials working for Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the minister had agreed to amend the bill, which had been introduced at Holyrood the previous year. \nThe officials said: \"Minister agreed to proposed amendment that would addressed [sic] concerns from Queen's solicitors\".\nSetting out the need for the exemption in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Wheelhouse said that in the rare cases where the Queen's estate could be used for a heat network, different provisions were needed for the use of compulsory purchase orders on Her Majesty's land.\nHe said licence holders for heat networks were likely to be private enterprises, as opposed to public authorities which are more typically involved with compulsory purchase.\nMr Rennie said lobbying from Buckingham Palace should have been declared.\nHe said: \"This research shows that Queen's consent isn't just some arcane legacy from parliament's past. It's a live process. Laws are secretly being changed behind Scotland's back as a result.\n\"That's not what people would expect in a democracy. I'm sure people will be shocked to see the Scottish government's willingness to pander to the process.\n\"Their readiness to hide it from public view shows they have no interest in acting transparently.\"\nMr Rennie added there should be \"no secret doors to changing the law\" and called on the Scottish government to fully share how the process influences law making.\nA Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \"The royal household can be consulted on bills in order to ensure the technical accuracy and consistency of the application of the bill to the Crown, a complex legal principle governed by statute and common law.\n\"This process does not change the nature of any such bill.\"\nThe Scottish government said its policy was that the Crown should be subject to regulatory requirements on the same basis as everyone else \"unless there is a legitimate reason for an exemption or variation.\"\nA spokesman added: \"However, Crown consent is required by law if a bill impacts the private property or interests of the sovereign - and that is what happened in this case.\n\"In this instance, the Scottish government considered it appropriate to limit the exercise of compulsory purchase powers in relation to the Queen's private estates.\n\"The minister explained in detail to Parliament the reasons why it was appropriate to amend the bill in this way - with specific reference to the Queen's private estates - and Parliament agreed.\" "

      "text": "Facebook has warned that it expects revenue growth to slow down \"significantly\" in the second half of 2021.\nThe tech giant saw revenue rise to $29bn (\u00a321bn) in the three months to 30 June, up from $18.69bn last year.\nBut it said that sales would slow \"as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth\".\nIt had benefitted from firms targeting consumers with online ads during lockdown.\nIts shares fell as much as 5% in after-hours trading.\nIts founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: \"We had a strong quarter as we continue to help businesses grow and people stay connected.\"\nThe number of people using the social network monthly rose to 2.9 billion.\nAnd although its profits doubled to $10.4bn in the second quarter, the company cautioned that it expects \"year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis.\"\nThe California-based company also pointed towards a number of other challenges it would face in the coming months, such as new privacy controls that Apple introduced in April.\nThey are aimed at limiting advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their knowledge, which Facebook said was likely to have an impact on its income, particularly between July and October, and it has factored into its projections for how it will perform.\nIf consumers opt out of being tracked, it makes it harder for firms such as Facebook to target adverts, which make up a big chunk of their revenue.\nPaolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said: \"It is apparent that the Facebook user base is skewed to iOS users and will continue to be negatively impacted from the iOS change. \nOther technology firms \"have seemed to navigate this challenge but all will see a negative impact longer-term\" he said.\nFacebook also faced several investigations over its handling of users' personal information, both in the UK and Ireland and overseas.\nIn April, for example, the Irish Data Protection Commission launched an investigation into a data leak in which the details of hundreds of millions of Facebook users were published online.\nFacebook said it was \"co-operating fully\" with the relevant authorities.\nDespite concerns over privacy, Mark Zuckerberg recently laid out his plans to transform Facebook from a social media network into a \"metaverse company\" in the next five years.\nA metaverse is an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using virtual reality (VR) headsets.\nThe Facebook boss described it as \"an embodied internet where instead of just viewing content - you are in it\".\nHe told tech publication The Verge that people shouldn't live through \"small, glowing rectangles\".\n\"That's not really how people are made to interact,\" he said, speaking of reliance on mobile phones.\nFacebook has invested heavily in virtual reality, spending $2bn (\u00a31.46bn) on acquiring Oculus, which develops its VR products.\nIn its update to investors on Wednesday, it said it expects spending on investments such as the development of new products as well as on data centres and servers to total up to $21bn in 2021.\nSilicon Valley giants are facing increased scrutiny at the moment as profits rise and their reach expands.\nIn the UK, a regulator called the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) has just started work on curbing tech companies' dominance by creating new codes of conduct for them.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said that the new unit, which will be based inside the Competition and Markets Authority, will be \"unashamedly pro-competition\".\nAnd in the US, President Biden signed an executive order earlier in July in a bid to promote further competition.\nIt suggested that problems have arisen because of large tech firms collecting too much personal data, buying up prospective competitors and competing unfairly with small businesses.\nIt included several recommendations such as greater scrutiny of mergers in the tech sector and barring unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces.\nSophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of the recent Apple update: \"This isn't the first time Facebook's stared down the barrel of a regulatory or privacy problem, and it won't be the last.\n\"No-one can say in good faith that Facebook faces a smooth road from here, but it's reasonable to believe Facebook's long-term investment case remains intact.\""

      "text": "The UK is already undergoing disruptive climate change with increased rainfall, sunshine and temperatures, according to scientists.\nThe year 2020 was the third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest on record, scientists said in the latest UK State of the Climate report.\nNo other year is in the top 10 on all three criteria.\nThe experts said that, in the space of 30 years, the UK has become 0.9C warmer and 6% wetter.\nThe report's lead author Mike Kendon, climate information scientist at the UK Met Office, told BBC News: \u201cA lot of people think climate change is in the future \u2013 but this proves the climate is already changing here in the UK.\n\u201cAs it continues to warm we are going to see more and more extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods.\u201d \nThe report says the UK has become hotter, sunnier and rainier:\nScientists warn of worse extreme weather if global temperatures rise and politicians fail to curb carbon emissions.  \nAnd in a separate report, scientists warned that greenhouse gas levels were already too high \u201cfor a manageable future for humanity\u201c.\nLiz Bentley, head of the Royal Meteorological Society, said that even if governments could achieve the challenging outcome of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C \u2013 which looks very unlikely - that would still lead to a 10% increase in the amount of water the air can hold.\n\u201cIn the UK,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are likely to see temperatures of 40C. As we get 1.5C warming, that\u2019ll be something we see on a regular basis. \n\"People don\u2019t realise that even a small temperature rise of 0.1 or 0.2 degrees overall can make a huge difference \u2013 especially in the frequency and intensity of extreme events.\n\u201cWe had roads melting last year, rails start to buckle, electric cabling starts to buckle. We often say we\u2019d like a climate like the Med, but people were soon complaining they were too hot - not just in the day but especially at night.\n\u201cIt often takes a massive high-impact event to change attitudes to the climate \u2013 so let\u2019s hope what\u2019s been happening recently with extreme weather will raise the will to tackle the problem.\u201d\nThe State of the Climate report also indicates that plants are responding to the changes in climate. Leaves appeared on average 10.4 days earlier than the 1999-2019 baseline for a range of common shrub and tree species.\nWhile the signs of spring got earlier, so did the indications of autumn - trees in 2020 went bare on average 4.3 days earlier than the baseline.\nThe report also said that, while substantial snow fell in 2018, 2013, 2010 and 2009, the number and severity of such weather events have declined since the 1960s.\nSir James Bevan, the head of the Environment Agency, said there were more than five million homes at risk of flooding in England - and \"that risk is rising as the climate changes\".\n\"We can't remove the risk but we can reduce it,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nHe said the EA's thinking needed to change faster than the climate, and its new strategy was not only about preventing floods, but also making communities more resilient to flooding when it does happen so that it does less damage.\nAnd Sir James said the government has made its biggest investment yet in flood defences, with \u00a35.2bn of funding to be spent on building 2,000 new flood defence schemes over the next six years.\nMeanwhile, a new paper from the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, founded by the former UK chief scientist Prof Sir David King, asks whether rapid heating in the Arctic region is driving changes in the jet stream in a way that influenced the recent weather extremes. \nThe jet stream is a core of strong winds travelling west to east about five to seven miles above the Earth.\nThe new paper said: \"We are simultaneously witnessing weather disaster in Germany, the highest temperatures for June in Finland and the US, the catastrophic heatwave in British Columbia, and extreme heat in Siberia.\n\"These are all outlier events that exceed what one would expect if it were 'only' a 1.2C warming impact (that's the amount the Earth has already warmed since pre-industrial times).\n\"Greenhouse gas levels are already too high for a manageable future for humanity.\"\nThe paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, urges governments to start removing greenhouse gases at scale from the atmosphere.\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "tags": "Contact tracing,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of self-isolation alerts sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales has risen to a new record of 689,313 in the week up to 21 July. \nThe figures represent an increase of over 70,000 compared with the previous week.\nBut the rate of increase was lower than the previous week, rising by 11% compared to 17%.\nIf you are \"pinged\" by the app you are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nHowever the government has said it is crucial for people to do so.\nIn recent weeks, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption.\nIt led to the government allowing some key workers - such as those working in food distribution - to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests.\nThere are currently 260 testing sites open for these workers, Downing Street said on Thursday - and they are working to set up another 800. After that, 1,200 more sites will be opened \"over the coming days\".\nFrom 16 August, all fully-vaccinated people will not need to self-isolate if pinged by the app, although they will be encouraged to book a Covid PCR test.\nThe impact on businesses has resulted in calls for the 16 August deadline to be brought forward.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is asking for urgent assistance to exempt staff pinged by the NHS Covid app saying pings are affecting production.\nMany in the hospitality industry also complained of shortages as staff had to self-isolate. Some bar staff have told the BBC that they've lost a lot of money by missing shifts, while others say they have been told to delete the app by their manager.\nThe app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the NHS Test and Trace team.\nLatest data from Test and Trace shows that 14% of cases transferred to contact-tracers in the week to 21 July were not reached and so were unable to provide details of close contacts. \nThis is the highest proportion of people not reached since October last year.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam said separate figures from Public Health England showed the vaccines have now prevented 22 million Covid cases and 60,000 deaths. He added it was \"truly massive\".\nIf you were looking for evidence that the \"pingdemic\" is over you will struggle to find it in these statistics. The figure of nearly 690,000 contact tracing alerts - or pings - is a new record, up 11% on the previous week. They were triggered by nearly 148,000 positive test results entered in the app, up 25%.\nDespite the anecdotal evidence of people switching off or getting rid of the app, there is no sign yet of mass deletions.\nBut there are a few straws in the wind suggesting things might be changing. The rate of increase in pings slowed, and the number of alerts triggered by each positive test result was down. That suggests that people who later became infected had fewer close contacts - either because they were socialising less or because those they encountered did not have the app.\nIn the week when restrictions in England were relaxed so that venues did not need to record visitors' details, check-ins via the app were sharply lower.\nAs they find they don't need it to check in, more people may decide the app is more trouble than it's worth.\nBut the team which designed it believes the NHS Covid-19 app is changing behaviour in useful ways - even if someone ignores a ping's instruction to self isolate they may become more cautious, and anyone who has a holiday planned may be nudged into staying at home for a few days beforehand rather than having their plans spoiled by an alert.\nAt first, it was criticised for being ineffective, in recent weeks it's been accused of disrupting thousands of businesses, but its designers believe this experimental technology is finally proving that it can be a useful weapon in controlling the pandemic.\nAfter a week of falling cases the number of people testing positive for coronavirus rose on Wednesday, when 27,734 new daily cases were reported.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"The truth is, when it comes to case numbers no one really knows where they are going to go next\".\nPeople in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own).\nIf you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes.\nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nSeparately to the NHS Covid app, there have also been changes to the NHS app, which among other things is used for Covid vaccination records.\nIt has been updated to allow iPhone and iPad users to store their Covid Pass using the Apple Wallet app.\nThis can be used at events and venues in England, but not for international travel the government says."

      "text": "Parents of pupils in private schools or living in affluent areas of England were the most likely to put pressure on teachers over exam grades, suggests research from the Sutton Trust.\nAlmost a quarter of private school teachers had been contacted by parents over A-level and GCSE grades, twice as many as in schools in deprived areas.\nTeachers submitted grades this year after exams were disrupted by Covid.\nHead teachers warned such lobbying was \"inappropriate\" and added stress.\nThe research, based on a survey of 3,200 teachers, showed teachers in private schools came under the greatest pressure, with the highest number, 23%, reporting parents contacting them over exam grades.\nBut there was also a social gap between state schools, with 17% of teachers in better-off areas facing pressure from parents, compared with 11% in disadvantaged areas.\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said parents lobbying for their children \"think they are doing the best for their children, but it is yet another issue which has added to the stress of an extremely stressful period\".\nBut he reassured students that grades were based on objective evidence - \"rather than whose parents have the sharpest elbows\".\nMr Barton had previously warned the education select committee that some parents were threatening to involve lawyers over grades and that schools were expecting a \"huge number of appeals\".\nSchools submitted their judgements on grades last month - and the final results will appear in a couple of weeks, with forecasts of an increase in top grades, which could put pressure on university places.\nResearchers found that half of students applying to university were worried that the disruption caused by the pandemic and the replacement grading system would negatively affect their chance of getting into their first choice university.\nBut Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents and students should be confident of the fairness and \"rigour of this year's awarding processes and understand that it is inappropriate to put pressure on staff\".\nSchools have been able to use a range of evidence for grades, including \"mini-exam\" test papers, mock exams, homework and coursework - after the usual set of full exam papers were cancelled.\nThe study from the Sutton Trust charity, which champions social mobility, shows how much variation there has been. Typically three or four \"mini-exams\" taken, but there were some schools taking more than six, while others were taking one, two or none at all.\nThere were also warnings of the difficulties facing some pupils when they were studying from home - such as a lack of space to work and problems with internet connections and equipment.\nThe report calls on universities to give extra consideration to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who narrowly missed their required grades.\nAnd there is a warning that this year's new students will need more support to settle in, after so many difficulties from the pandemic and when students might not have been able to visit universities on open days.\n\"This year's cohort of university applicants have faced almost two years of disrupted education. As we approach results day, it's vital that poorer students are not disadvantaged by the greater impact of the pandemic on them,\" said Sutton Trust founder Sir Peter Lampl.\nHe also backed suggestions to change the timetable for university applications, so that students could apply once they knew their grades.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"Students have only been assessed on what they had been taught, supporting students who may not have had the opportunity to learn as much as they would do in a normal year and meaning that teachers have effectively made their assessments based on every student having their best day.\n\"No teacher should be put under undue pressure and grades are subject to wider internal checks in schools and external checks by exam boards to make sure they are a fair reflection of students' work.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nParents of pupils in private schools or those living in affluent areas of England were the most likely to put pressure on teachers over exam grades, research suggests. Parents contacted almost a quarter of private school teachers about A-level and GCSE grades after the usual exams were cancelled due to the pandemic. That was twice as many than from schools in deprived areas, according to the Sutton Trust. This lobbying is \"inappropriate\" and adds to stress, head teachers warn.\nInternational cruises will resume from England after a 16-month break due to the pandemic. They can start again from Monday in a move welcomed by the industry. It would mean people arriving at UK ports who have been fully vaccinated in the US and the EU will also not have to isolate, the UK government says. Domestic cruises have been allowed to run from May.\nAs planned, from Sunday the government's Job Retention Scheme, more commonly known as furlough, will be wound down further. This means employers will have to make bigger payments to support wages while the government drops its contribution. The wind down comes ahead of the scheme's scheduled end date on 30 September.\nA shortage of vaccines and slow rollouts have sparked a new trend where many tourists fly to the US to get vaccinated. Meet the vaccine tourists who have travelled there to get their jabs.\nLivestreams are a fantastic way to fill the gap when in-person live events are cancelled, says Caroline Burgess-Pike. She's a huge music festival fan and during the Covid pandemic streaming has been \"important to help support the live music and event industry at such a difficult time\", she adds.

      "text": "Staff at US gaming giant Activision Blizzard have staged a walk-out over accusations of sexism and harassment. \nThe company behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft was sued last week by the state of California over alleged violations of state workplace protection laws.\nFemale employees described a \"frat boy\" culture, the lawsuit said. \nActivision denied the allegations claiming they were \"distorted and in many cases false\". \nOn Tuesday, Activision's CEO said the initial response had been \"tone-deaf\". \nEmployees protested outside the company's campus in Irvine on Wednesday. Some were pictured holding signs that read \"women's voices matter\" and \"fight bad guys in game, fight bad guys IRL\". \nOn social media, a number of gamers said they would not login to anything Activision Blizzard during the walkout in solidarity with employees. \nThe allegations against Activision were contained in a legal filing from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) following a two-year investigation.\nIt included accusations of drunken harassment of female employees by male colleagues or supervisors, a culture of ignoring complaints and retaliation against women who made them, and widespread discrimination against women in areas such as equal pay and promotion opportunity. \nThe lawsuit found that women make up only 20% of Activision's staff. \nMore than 2,000 employees have signed an open letter calling for an end to mandatory arbitration in harassment cases, improvements in recruiting practices and creation of a diversity and equity task force. \nChief Executive Bobby Kotick said on Tuesday that the company will \"continue to investigate each and every claim\" of sexism at Activision \"and will not hesitate to take decisive action\". \n\"Anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated,\" he said.\nMr Kotick added that Activision's games criticised as being sexist, will also be removed following complaints from staff and gamers. He said that there would be listening sessions for staff to \"speak out and share areas for improvement\". "

He had a career in place, he was extremely talented, he had a future, a future that he wanted and yearned for and we were supporting him to achieve.\n\"Due to a lack of support, he took his life. He didn't leave a note, he took his life in a place which affected him, a place which was an inadequate go-to for safety when he was distressed or frustrated.\"\nA child practice review has now been published by the Mid and West Wales Safeguarding Children Board.\nThe report said Bradley was described by his family as being \"the happiest he had ever been\" in the weeks prior to his death.\nHe had enjoyed a good summer, had been on holiday and was doing well in equine competitions of a \"prestigious standing\".\nHis school attendance was good and he had been excited about the school prom, the report added.\nHe was described as a much-loved son, brother and stepson who had a lot to celebrate and was an accomplished horse rider, competing nationally at a high standard.\nBut Bradley was bullied in school and on the school bus, which caused him distress and concern, the report said.\nIt also said he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and early trauma.\nOn one occasion, Bradley was allegedly inappropriately touched by another pupil.\nThe report said his head of year was told, but it was not passed on to the safeguarding lead or head teacher.\nIt said the alleged incident was \"not easily identifiable in records submitted\" by the school.\nThe school was questioned about it and, on reflection, the headteacher acknowledged that they would have advised the incident be reported and investigated under the school's safeguarding procedures as this was an alleged peer on peer abuse situation and an alleged sexual assault. \nThe report also described a letter written by a cognitive behaviour psychotherapist from October 2017 that said Bradley had been bullied and they were concerned at the \"continued impact of this on his emotional and mental wellbeing\". \nThey said there had been a clear change in his presentation.\nThe report acknowledged good practice, but also identified areas for learning.\nAuthor Gladys Rhodes White said that everybody had done their best - especially the family - to listen to Bradley.\nHowever, she said that generally there was more everyone could do to listen and respond to the needs of children \"in a way that they know we have heard them\".\n\"There are some clear lessons identified in the report,\" she said.\n\"I think everybody needs to look at those and put them into practice in their own organisations and make sure that those lessons become reality - so not put the report on a shelf and ignore the learning.\"\nMr John agreed that children's voices should be heard, but said the report was somewhat lacking.\n\"Bradley's voice wasn't heard. The fact that he took his life where he did is very, very symbolic.\n\"I feel [the report] is in depth, it's looked at it from all angles, but did not have the authority to question some of those perspectives or angles. It had to rely on explanations given.\"\nThe report identified eight themes for learning, including a need to ensure that practice, training and policy on bullying is compliant and acknowledges the added vulnerabilities of children who have additional learning needs, emotional mental health and well-being issues, have experienced ACEs or have disabilities."

      "title": "Simone Biles: What are the twisties in gymnastics?",
      "tags": "Simone Biles,Mental health",
      "text": "US gymnast Simone Biles, who pulled out of two Olympic finals on Tuesday citing her mental health, told journalists earlier that day that she was \"having a little bit of the twisties\".\nIt's a term that sparked immediate discussion among gymnasts who recognised right away how dangerous a situation this must have been. But for the rest of the world, it's an unfamiliar term.\nSo what are the \"twisties\"?\nGymnasts have described the twisties as a kind of mental block. \nIn some sports a sudden mental block - like the \"yips\" in golf - may cost you a missed putt, or a lost game. \nIn gymnastics, it can cause a person to lose their sense of space and dimension as they're in the air, causing them to lose control of their body and do extra twists or flips that they hadn't intended. In the worst cases, they can find themselves suddenly unable to land safely. \nThe twisties can happen to a gymnast even if they've done the same manoeuvre for years without problems.\nBiles - one of the sport's all-time greatest athletes - appeared to become disorientated while performing a vault on Tuesday and stumbled as she landed.\nIt was a moment that struck an instant chord with those who suspected what she might be going through.\nBritish gymnast Claudia Fragapane competed at the Rio Olympics in 2016. \nShe fell on the uneven bars and the balance beam in the qualification rounds and then in April this year she again had a fall following a mental block, suffered a head injury and missed the cut for the individual all-around final in Tokyo.\nShe told the BBC she could \"understand exactly how Simone was feeling\".\n\"She has got a lot of weight on her shoulders. Everyone thinks that she is just going to be absolutely out of this world and perfect and she's not human. But actually she is human, and I think the pressure just got too much.\n\"It's really dangerous if you doubt yourself a little bit, or you find it really hard, you can really really hurt yourself. I've been in her shoes and I ended up hurting myself.\"\nFragapane said that as Olympic qualification loomed in April, she was \"very up and down with [her] moods\" - knowing that it could be her last time to try to go to another Olympics. \nShe was in the middle of the competition and made some mistakes, the gymnast said. \"Then I started to get a little bit worried and thought I have to give it my all for my last piece\". \nFragapane said that under pressure, for some reason, instead of performing a single somersault, she found herself trying to do a double from a slow run up.\nShe landed on her head and neck, wound up in hospital with concussion but says she could have been paralysed. \nChristina Myers, a former gymnast and now a gymnastics coach from Birmingham, Alabama, told BBC News that the twisties happen \"when your brain and body disconnect\".\n\"Imagine skydiving and your parachute won't open,\" she said. \"Your body starts adding extra twists and flips to the skill you're supposed to be doing, and it can affect even the skills that feel as routine as walking to an elite gymnast...\n\"Your brain wants nothing more than to perform the intended skill correctly, but your body feels like it suddenly has a mind of its own.\"\nShe added that \"because the twisties are mainly psychological, the harder you try to push through, the harder the twisties push back\".\nFor her generation of gymnasts, she said, mental pain was not seen as a valid reason for taking a break from the sport.\nTrying to push through the twisties \"led to a spinal stress fracture - an overuse injury made worse by trying to push through\", ultimately forcing her to stop competing.\nAnother ex-gymnast, Catherine Burns, compared it to being on a motorway and suddenly losing your muscle memory of how to drive.\n\"You're moving way too fast, you're totally lost, you're trying to think but you know you don't usually have to think to do these manoeuvres, you just feel them and do them,\" she tweeted. \"It's not only scary and unnerving, it's incredibly dangerous even if you're doing basic gymnastics.\"\nThe twisties can also lead to serious injury.\nFormer gymnast Jacoby Miles wrote on Instagram after one particularly bad bout of the twisties mid-air, she broke her neck on landing.\n\"It only took one time of getting lost... in the air for me to break my neck and leave me paralysed, most likely for life,\" she wrote. \n\"I'm so so glad [Biles] decided to not continue until she's mentally recovered.\""

He is in his 70s and feels vulnerable and distraught about what happened.\n\"I wanted to do this online trading as everyone was saying how good it was, to give us a better lifestyle,\" he said.\nAssuming he was making profits, he was drawn into a cycle of investing more in order to get money out.\nThe scammers said they needed 10% from him to get his money out. He said he was ill, and collapsed while on the phone and they were still on the line when paramedics arrived.\nDuring his illness, he kept getting text messages asking for more funds. He was confused and agreed to hand over more money and eventually lost more than \u00a3250,000 in life savings. \nBanks have been issuing warnings about fraudulent cryptocurrency trading, and are unlikely to refund any of his losses.\n\"I thought I was good with my money. It was really when I came out of hospital that the shock of what I'd done hit me,\" Joseph said.  \n\"The money was for our retirement and any future healthcare we needed. I have no means to recoup the money I've lost as I'm retired.\"\nCitizens Advice said that 36 million adults had been targeted by a scammer so far this year. Of those, 12% were by someone offering a fake investment or get-rich-quick scheme.\n\"Scams come in many guises, whether it be a get-rich-quick scheme or the promise of romance. It's easy to think it'll never happen to you, but the reality is anyone can be targeted and anyone can be tricked,\" said Matthew Upton, director of policy at the charity.\nA host of charities have been calling for scam adverts to be included in the government's Online Safety Bill, which will soon be scrutinised by MPs and Lords.\nOne of those, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, said that millions of internet users, particularly those with mental health problems, were in danger of losing money or sensitive personal information to scammers. \nIt said there were also risks of confusion as technology companies would be expected to remove some scams from their websites, but not others.\nMartin Lewis, who founded the charity, said: \"The UK is facing an epidemic of scam adverts. Our advertising rules were set up to police soap manufacturers making false cleanliness claims, not to tackle sophisticated, psychologically adept, digital organised crime, based around the world. \n\"This has left many scammers untraced, un-investigated, and unpunished. Many get away with these crimes with impunity.\""

and what would become his only - Olympic Games in 1920.\nIllness forced the Surrey Athletics Club member out of the individual 400m event, but he starred in the relay and helped Britain win their first of just two 4x400m relay Olympic titles.\nGriffiths built up an impressive lead in the first leg and his biographer John Hanna saying: \"I have a newspaper article with the headline in The Times that reads 'The Best Runner Wales has Produced'.\"\nGriffiths followed up his Olympic success with British half-mile titles in 1923 and 1925 and remained in the top three for nine years - but he would never compete for Great Britain at the Olympics again. \nIn 1923, the Amateur Athletic Association imposed a lifetime ban on him after discovering he accepted cash prizes - totalling \u00a33 - as a teenager, which contravened their rules. \nHis biographer, also Griffiths' grandson-in-law, believes this \"robbed\" him of the chance of adding to his Olympic tally in the 1924 Paris Olympics which was immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire.\nIn 1931, facing financial hardship in the Great Depression, Griffiths sold all his medals and trophies apart from his Olympic gold.\nWhen he died aged 45 in 1945 in London, fianncial hardship meant his family were unable to afford a headstone for the former Olympic champion's grave at St. Lawrence's Church in Edgware.\nNow his granddaughter Vanessa Hanna, who has terminal cancer, is determined to place a headstone at the unmarked grave of the Olympic gold medallist before she dies.\nThe 66-year-old, who is in the late stages of rhabdomyosarcoma, said her grandfather never recovered from the ban.\n\"I feel it was cruel when he was banned from the Olympics, he went into a deep depression afterwards,\" she said.\n\"He was robbed because he could have achieved so much more and I feel that now about myself being robbed of my life, because of cancer it has robbed me of a normal life with my husband and grandchildren.\"  \nOnly one Welsh athlete has won Olympics track and field gold since he and Jack Ainsworth-Davis struck gold as part of the 4x400m relay team with Griffiths in Antwerp in 1920 - with just four Welsh Olympic track and field golds in history.\nLast year, on the 100th anniversary of her grandfather's Olympic win, Mrs Hanna decided to take action.\n\"I feel very strongly he should definitely be remembered,\" she said.\n\"It means a great deal to me I've always felt so proud of him from a very early age.\" \nMrs Hanna said she had fond memories of taking his gold medal into school when she was aged six during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics- and believes a headstone is important for future generations: \n\"He's always been in my heart,\" she said.  \n\"We want to recognise that he existed and give him a grand memorial forever more so our grandchildren can go there and pay their respects in a civilised way.\n\"I too realise now it's important for something like that to be at his grave so the family can visit and say hello when you've died and pay their respect.\"\nMr Hanna said he had regularly been beating the so-called 'Chariots of Fire' athletes from Oxford and Cambridge and the ban was a way for British athletics bosses to prevent the working class Welshman from competing.  \n\"It was an era when sport was governed by the upper classes and this was a way for the AAA to get Cecil out of their hair,\" he said.\n\"He won \u00a31 prize money when he was just 17 running in a charity event for the home guard in his hometown in Neath. \n\"A month later he took part in a race in Swansea and that was logged - he won \u00a32 in that race which for his family would have been incredibly important.\"\nMr Hanna, 66, said Griffiths' father died when he was eight-years-old so in a time with no social security and the prize money would have been critical for his mother and two siblings. \n\"Six years later, the powers that be found this information out when he started to beat their Oxford and Cambridge athletes and they used this against him and banned him at the end of 1923.\"\nHe believes the ban stopped Griffiths from becoming a household name. \n\"He was described in a national paper as the best runner Wales has ever produced and I think that can still be argued today,\" he said.\n\"Only a few weeks before the 1924 Olympics, Cecil beat Douglas Lowe in the half mile race... he beat Lowe comfortably but with Cecil banned, Lowe went on to win gold at the Paris Olympics in the half mile.\n\"He could have run in the relay too so I believe he could have won a further two medals if he'd been allowed to compete and that would have put Cecil Griffiths right at the top of the league of British athlete's medal tally in track and field.\" "

      "text": "Parents of pupils in private schools or living in affluent areas of England were the most likely to put pressure on teachers over exam grades, suggests research from the Sutton Trust.\nAlmost a quarter of private school teachers had been contacted by parents over A-level and GCSE grades, twice as many as in schools in deprived areas.\nTeachers submitted grades this year after exams were disrupted by Covid.\nHead teachers warned such lobbying was \"inappropriate\" and added stress.\nThe research, based on a survey of 3,200 teachers, showed teachers in private schools came under the greatest pressure, with the highest number, 23%, reporting parents contacting them over exam grades.\nBut there was also a social gap between state schools, with 17% of teachers in better-off areas facing pressure from parents, compared with 11% in disadvantaged areas.\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said parents lobbying for their children \"think they are doing the best for their children, but it is yet another issue which has added to the stress of an extremely stressful period\".\nBut he reassured students that grades were based on objective evidence - \"rather than whose parents have the sharpest elbows\".\nMr Barton had previously warned the education select committee that some parents were threatening to involve lawyers over grades and that schools were expecting a \"huge number of appeals\".\nSchools submitted their judgements on grades last month - and the final results will appear in a couple of weeks, with forecasts of an increase in top grades, which could put pressure on university places.\nResearchers found that half of students applying to university were worried that the disruption caused by the pandemic and the replacement grading system would negatively affect their chance of getting into their first choice university.\nBut Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents and students should be confident of the fairness and \"rigour of this year's awarding processes and understand that it is inappropriate to put pressure on staff\".\nSchools have been able to use a range of evidence for grades, including \"mini-exam\" test papers, mock exams, homework and coursework - after the usual set of full exam papers were cancelled.\nThe study from the Sutton Trust charity, which champions social mobility, shows how much variation there has been. Typically three or four \"mini-exams\" taken, but there were some schools taking more than six, while others were taking one, two or none at all.\nThere were also warnings of the difficulties facing some pupils when they were studying from home - such as a lack of space to work and problems with internet connections and equipment.\nThe report calls on universities to give extra consideration to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who narrowly missed their required grades.\nAnd there is a warning that this year's new students will need more support to settle in, after so many difficulties from the pandemic and when students might not have been able to visit universities on open days.\n\"This year's cohort of university applicants have faced almost two years of disrupted education. As we approach results day, it's vital that poorer students are not disadvantaged by the greater impact of the pandemic on them,\" said Sutton Trust founder Sir Peter Lampl.\nHe also backed suggestions to change the timetable for university applications, so that students could apply once they knew their grades.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"Students have only been assessed on what they had been taught, supporting students who may not have had the opportunity to learn as much as they would do in a normal year and meaning that teachers have effectively made their assessments based on every student having their best day.\n\"No teacher should be put under undue pressure and grades are subject to wider internal checks in schools and external checks by exam boards to make sure they are a fair reflection of students' work.\""

      "text": "Family of a 13-year-old who had a stroke while cycling said his life has been changed forever after paramedics were blocked from helping him.\nCain was collapsed at Maerdy reservoir, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 16 July.\nHis friends called 999, but ambulance crews struggled to reach him due to boulders blocking the road.\nWelsh Water said it installed the boulders on an access route to the reservoir after the barrier had been \"repeatedly vandalised\".\nIt added that a sign with emergency contact details for 999 crews to call to use the road had also been damaged.\nCain's aunt Shelley Caviell said she could not believe her nephew, who was always outdoors, fishing, playing rugby, cycling and building dens, had had a stroke.\n\"He's such an outdoorsy child... how is his life going to be impacted now by this, by not being able to walk and things? Hopefully the doctors will be able to help him.\n\"Cain's life has been dramatically altered forever because the ambulance couldn't drive to him.\nCain, from Ferndale, was out with his friends when he started calling for help from his 15-year-old brother Cullun before fainting.\nAfter being unable to get phone signal at the reservoir, one of his friends ran to the village to ring 999, while his other friends, brother and cousin put him in the recovery position.\n\"We were so lucky that his friends acted quickly,\" said Ms Caviell.\nShe said that when ambulances arrived, the gates were locked and boulders were blocking the way in, meaning Cain's dad Neil, who rushed to the reservoir, had to take the paramedics on the back of a quad bike.\nMs Caviell said Cain's parents, Gemma Caviell and Neil Griffiths, initially thought he had heat exhaustion and dehydration .\nHowever, after being taken to Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, doctors discovered he had suffered a stroke and had a blood clot on the brain.\nMs Caviell said doctors told her there was a \"vital four-hour window\" for treatment after Cain had the stroke, and she said this had been missed due to the delay.\nCain, a keen rugby and football fan, was placed in an induced coma and put on a ventilator and his parents played clips of messages of support from sports stars though headphones.\nDozens of stars, including Gareth Bale and Shane Williams, sent video messages to the family, and the family now hope to show him the full messages.\nCain, who is being treated at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, is now awake, off the ventilator and has managed to go outside in his wheelchair, but has lost movement in the right side of his body and is unable to speak.\nMs Caviell said, while the outlook was positive and there was hope that with intense rehabilitation he would regain some movement and his speech, there was a long road ahead.\n\"It's heart-breaking. We really hope he will be able to get back to being able to walk, but he may never get his leg moving again.\"\nDoctors are now trying to find out why Cain had a stroke.\nCain's family fear someone will die unless Welsh Water removes the boulders.  \nWelsh Water said the boulders had been installed on one of the access routes after \"repeated vandalism\" to original barrier.\n\"We did also put signage in place where the boulders are located with a telephone number to call should emergency access be required but this has also been vandalised,\" a spokesman said.\n\"We are in the process of replacing the sign and will also be liaising with all of the emergency services to advise them of the contact number should they need emergency access in future.\"\nMs Caviell added: \"It's a massive open pool of water, if someone was drowning, they would not live.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be offered to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK, following updated advice from the UK's vaccine committee.\nAll over-18s across the UK can have two Covid vaccine doses, as can some vulnerable, high-risk children over 12.\nHealthy, low-risk children between 12 and 15 have only been offered a single dose - which should be delayed until 12 weeks after a coronavirus infection.\nThe Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says a second dose for those aged 16 and 17 is safe and effective 12 weeks after the first.\nThe JCVI has previously held back from recommending a second dose because of concerns over a very rare heart condition, called myocarditis, experienced by tiny numbers of young people - particularly boys - after the second dose.\nIt says it is now reassured by evidence from other countries that a 12-week gap between doses would lower that already very small risk.\nA decision on a second dose for 12-15s has not yet been made but could happen in the next few weeks.\nIn the meantime, all 12-17 year olds should wait 12 weeks after a Covid infection before having their first or second dose.\nNo vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nIf you're over 18, and want to book your first, second or booster dose, you can find out how here.\nNo. If you're under 40 or pregnant you'll be given Pfizer or Moderna.\nEvery woman who is pregnant (or planning to become pregnant) is encouraged to get two vaccine doses. Hospital figures show that 98% of pregnant women admitted to intensive care this year were not vaccinated.\nUnder-18s have so far been offered Pfizer. \nThe vaccines are very effective at protecting people against becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid-19. \nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests more than 90% protection against hospitalisation and death with all three vaccines.\nThe vaccines are less effective at stopping people becoming infected by the virus, developing mild symptoms or passing it on - but they do reduce the risk of that happening too.\nIf you've been double-jabbed, you are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nCovid vaccines aren't compulsory, but everyone is urged to get jabbed to protect themselves, their family, friends and wider society.\nChildren under 16 don't need parental consent to get jabbed, as long as they are believed to have \"enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment\". This is known as \"Gillick competence\". \nBeing fully vaccinated can make travelling to most other countries easier, and in many cases means you will not have to self-isolate either when you return to the UK. \nHowever, it's worth bearing in mind that under-16s are not eligible for their own digital NHS Covid Pass, which is now accepted widely as proof of vaccination. \nWhat's more, the single jab which most UK teenagers have so far received, is not recognised as full vaccination by some countries (including France), and more tests may be required.\nCheck your destination's rules on the Foreign Office website before you travel. \nMost are mild, completely normal and disappear after a few days. \nThey happen because the body's defences are reacting to the vaccine, and include:\nA very small number of people had a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so you should discuss any allergies you have before vaccination.\nThere's no evidence to suggest you should avoid alcohol altogether, but drinking in large quantities can suppress your immune system.\nSome women have experienced unusually heavy, painful or prolonged periods after being jabbed.\nThis may be because the vaccine prompts an increase in activity in the immune system, which also plays a role in the menstrual cycle. \nHowever, there's no evidence  the vaccine has any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nPregnant women are being urged to get the vaccine, to protect themselves and their babies.\nCoronavirus can cause serious illness in some women in later pregnancy, and possibly a slightly higher rate of stillbirth.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy or are breastfeeding, government guidance says you can still get vaccinated, \nA recent study suggests vaccination can help improve long Covid symptoms.\nResearchers think the vaccine could be pressing the body's reset button and helping it recover.

I want to be happy.\"\nCallum Lea has suffered multiple homophobic attacks and said he just wanted to live without having to \"expect a lot of abuse\" due to his sexuality.\nThe 26-year-old from Cardiff believes more has to be done to raise awareness and education about LGBTQ+ issues.\nThe Welsh government has now outlined its plans to make Wales \"the most LGBTQ+ friendly nation\" in Europe.\nThe most traumatising incident happened to Callum earlier this year when he was verbally and physically attacked in Cardiff. \n\"There was a group of lads that started to verbally assault me and call me every homophobic word under the sun,\" he said.\nThe group pushed him to the floor and he was \"kicked repeatedly\".\n\"I was left with cuts, bruises. I had a mild concussion, whiplash and I was traumatised.\n\"I felt embarrassed. I didn't want people to see that someone had got the better of me.\"\nIt is not just physical attacks that hurt Callum - he said he has become used to comments, looks and other micro-aggressions. \nIn the past, he said he preferred to walk down a street alone so friends and family did not have to see people \"staring or laughing\" at him.\n\"I just want to live my life, carefree like everyone else.\n\"I don't think anyone else would ever consider going to the shop to get some milk and\u2026 have to consider that they are going to be abused that they going to be attacked\u2026 that's no way to live.\"\nCallum insisted LGBTQ+ people \"need to be part of the conversation\" in improving awareness and education.\nThe Welsh government has launched a consultation for its action plan, developed in collaboration with members of the LGBTQ+ community.\nIts purpose is to help \"coordinate action between the government, stakeholders, the public and other agencies\".\nThe plan includes:\nThe plan was launched by deputy minister for social partnership, Hannah Blythyn, who said the \"authenticity of her experiences\" as a gay woman had helped the process.\n\"It's a political priority of the Welsh government but it's personal to me too and I'm really proud and quite moved to be in that position and to really drive this forward,\" she said. \n\"Launching our action plan today will allow everyone, right across Wales to help us achieve our goal to become the most LGBTQ+ friendly nation in Europe.\"\nThe plan was was formed following a report by an independent expert group, which laid out several recommendations.\nLu Thomas, who led the expert panel, said: \"Ministers have continually used the phrase 'progress is never inevitable' and with the release of the consultation today, it clearly shows the Welsh government is committed to achieving real progress in our society.\"\nLGBTQ+ charity Stonewall welcomed the consultation. \nIestyn Wyn, the charity's campaigns, policy and research manager, said: \"An LGBT person's life touches upon all those policy areas, it's important that we recognise what are the different challenges in those different policy areas, so that Welsh government can take the necessary action to ensure that we work towards a Wales that is a safe place for LGBTQ+ people to thrive.\""

      "text": "Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney for breach of contract after it streamed her superhero film Black Widow at the same time as its cinema release.\nThe film set a box office record for the Covid-19 pandemic, grossing $218m (\u00a3157m) in its first weekend. \nBut box office receipts then fell sharply and Ms Johansson argues she was deprived of potential earnings.\nIn response, Disney said it had \"fully complied\" with her contract and that her case had \"no merit whatsoever\".\nMs Johansson said she was promised by Marvel Studios, which is owned by Disney, that Black Widow would be a \"theatrical release\".\nShe said she had understood this to mean a \"window\" of time would pass before it would be streamed - a period that has traditionally lasted 90 days.\nDuring the pandemic a number of Hollywood studios opted to bypass cinemas, many of which had been closed, and release their films online instead.\nNow that most cinemas have reopened, Disney, along with fellow giant Warner Bros, has chosen to maintain a dual release strategy for their major films.\nOn its first weekend, Black Widow took some $80m in ticket sales in North America and $78m internationally, plus at least $60m in Disney+ Premier Access rentals.\nSources close to the actor, whose salary was based on the box office performance of the film, project that she lost $50m, according to media reports.\nDisney countered by claiming that the dual release strategy had \"significantly enhanced [Johansson's] ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20m she has received to date\".\nIn a strongly worded statement, it said her legal action was \"especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic\".\nJohansson's agent fired back, accusing Disney of \"shamelessly\" trying to smear her character.\n\"Scarlett has been Disney's partner on nine movies, which have earned Disney and its shareholders billions,\" wrote Bryan Lourd in a statement. \n\"The company included her salary in their press statement in an attempt to weaponise her success as an artist and businesswoman, as if that were something she should be ashamed of. \n\"Disney's direct attack on her character and all else they implied is beneath the company that many of us in the creative community have worked with successfully for decades.\"\nBefore the pandemic, Hollywood film fans would typically have to watch new releases exclusively at the cinema or wait three months to have them streamed to their devices.    \nMajor studios have recently been mixing cinema releases and streaming in different ways as cinemas battle to win back viewers wary of catching Covid in confined spaces.\nYet the move has not proved popular with some of the film industry's leading talents, among them Tenet and The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan.\nLast year the British film-maker criticised Warner Bros over its plans to release major movies on HBO Max, describing the situation as \"a real bait and switch\".\n\"Warner Bros had an incredible machine for getting a film-maker's work out everywhere, both in theatres and in the home, and they are dismantling it as we speak,\" he told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\"Their decision makes no economic sense and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction.\"\nMatt Mueller, editor of industry publication Screen Daily, said he expected the dispute would be resolved behind closed doors before it reached a courtroom.\n\"It's surprising that Disney let it get to this stage, given Warner Bros was able to negotiate with the talent that it irked when it made the decision to go day-and-date between cinemas and HBO Max for its 2021 titles,\" he told BBC News.\n\"I think other stars will look at how Scarlett's case proceeds, while studios with complementary streaming platforms will already be looking at what contractual steps they need to take to ward off further actions.\"\nWhatever the outcome of Johansson's case, Mueller doubts it will make Disney change its dual release strategy.\n\"Disney's ultimate boss is its shareholders and they want Disney+ to be hugely successful,\" he continued.\n\"But it might make the top talent think twice if they don't think they can score the mega-paydays that theatrical releases have been able to generate for stars in the past.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

He added that the app was \"simply the easiest form of presenting this status\" and that the only intention had been to ensure the safety of their customers.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for ministers to scrap Covid passes or at least allow MPs to debate them in Parliament.\nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael accused ministers of committing to Covid passports \"by stealth\".\n\"We now have a new ID card snuck onto our phones without even as much as a whisper from the government,\" he said.\nAfter the BBC reported the entry requirement on Thursday night, Ultimate Power - a third-party which organises club nights at venues including the O2 Ritz in Manchester and London's Electric Ballroom - deleted a webpage and social media posts.\nIt had said that, for its \"initial London and Manchester events, we are requesting Covid passes at point of entry to our clubs\".\nA spokeswoman for the O2 Ritz said the venue requires customers to show their Covid status on entry - but they could do this by obtaining a negative lateral flow result by text message, email, or letter.\nCustomers can also voluntarily use the NHS Covid Pass to prove a negative test, alongside full vaccination or immunity, the venue's website said.\nSimilar entry requirements will apply to guests at the Electric Ballroom.\nIt comes after some nightclub owners previously told the BBC Covid passes were \"unworkable\" and that they would not be requiring them.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced earlier this month that people attending nightclubs and other large venues where crowds gather would be required to be fully vaccinated from the end of September.\nA \"domestic\" pass option on England's NHS app explains there are four ways to get an NHS Covid pass - through \"testing, full vaccination, natural immunity, or an exemption\".\nIt says: \"You may need to show you NHS Covid Pass at places that have chosen to use the service.\" People can also request a paper pass to prove their vaccination status.\nThe wording on the NHS Covid app was changed on Monday after trials of the domestic pass for events ended, the Department of Health confirmed.\nOther updates made this week include linking the pass to Apple Wallet and allowing those who took part in the trial of the Novavax vaccine to obtain a pass.\nDiffering approaches to vaccination status are emerging across the UK, amid legal, privacy and discrimination concerns.\nIn Scotland, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said barring people who refuse a coronavirus vaccination from certain large events is the wrong approach.\nIn England, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove warned those who refuse to take a vaccine may be unable to access mass attendance venues such as football stadia or nightclubs.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the government was in favour of making Covid passes compulsory in more settings.\nTo access their NHS Covid pass, users must first link their NHS number with other personal information to verify their identity.\nAccording to the terms of the service, a domestic NHS Covid pass allows a person to demonstrate their Covid-19 lateral flow, PCR test or vaccine status for events or \"other domestic uses which the government may approve from time to time\".\nThe terms add that the service is not intended to be used by employers to check their staff have been vaccinated.\nIt also allows an exemption to apply, for example, when a person has taken part in an official trial for a Covid vaccine that has yet to receive approval.\nA travel NHS Covid pass allows a person to demonstrate their vaccination status for international travel.\nThe NHS app is described as being \"a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smart phone or tablet\".\nIt is available to people aged 13 and over who are registered with a GP service and can be accessed on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as on desktop devices.\nOther functions on the app include appointments, prescriptions as well as allowing users to access an overview of their medical history and records held by their GP.\nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Businesses, events and venues have been encouraged to use the Covid pass to help reduce transmission of Covid-19.\""

      "tags": "NI Health,Cancer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The cancellation of some cancer surgeries is a \"direct effect\" of people not getting vaccinated against Covid, the Belfast Health Trust's medical director has said.\nOn Wednesday the Trust announced it was cancelling some surgeries due to Covid-19 pressures.\nDr Chris Hagan said those pressures were a result of rising infections due to unvaccinated people.\nHe apologised and said rescheduling of the operations had started.\nHe said about 24 patients were affected.\nThe Health and Social Care Board's Paul Cavanagh later told Stormont's health committee that 120 surgeries of all types have been cancelled this week.\nDr Hagan told BBC's Good Morning Ulster it was really important to highlight why this had happened.\n\"Last week we were sitting with about 50 Covid patients in our hospitals, that has now risen to over 100,\" he said.\n\"There is enormous pressure on our intensive care units with 10 patients in our intensive care, seven of whom are ventilated.\n\"It is really important we get that message across that not taking up vaccine is driving infection in the community and that choice not to get vaccinated is then leading on to direct effects like this.\"\nHe added: \"I just want to apologise that we have had to do this, it is a terrible thing to have to cancel people who are expecting surgery, at the last minute.\n\"But I want to reassure the public that we will try and reschedule all these operations as quickly as possible.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Cavanagh told the health committee about 1,800 healthcare staff in Northern Ireland were off work due to Covid.\nThe head of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, Patricia Donnelly, told members of Stormont's health committee on Thursday that uptake among the 18-29 age group was \"incredibly slow\".\nShe said it was a cause of \"enormous concern\" that the pace of the vaccination programme \"went off a cliff\" in June when it opened to this younger age group.\nJust under 60% of 18-29 year olds have received a first jab. \nThe next lowest uptake rate is 70% for the 30-39 year olds. All the age cohorts over the age of 60 have a 100% uptake rate.\nShe said while 90,000 people a week were getting vaccinated earlier in the roll-out, the programme has slowed to the extent where it would be \"lucky\" if 1,000 to 2,000 people were getting jabbed each day.\nThe chief executive of Action Cancer said he was \"sickened\" and \"disappointed\" by the surgery cancellations.\nGareth Kirk said it was a \"critical situation\" and was \"cruel\" for cancer patients.\n\"That is hard, having got a cancer diagnosis, it is tough psychologically building up to the time of your surgery - your treatment is worrying and it is stressful and then to be led up probably to the top of the mountain and then taken down again is cruel,\" he said.\nProf Mark Taylor, from the Royal College of Surgeons, said the postponement of \"potentially life-saving cancer surgeries\" was \"extremely worrying\".\n\"In May, we published an action plan for tackling NI's waiting times that focused on protecting planned surgery from future stoppages due to Covid-19 surges or winter flu season,\" he said.\n\"We called for greater investment, Covid-light sites and surgical hubs to help keep surgery going and spoke about patients and surgeons being ready to travel if it means getting surgery done quicker.\"\nCancer surgery is continuing in the Northern and Southern trusts, BBC News NI understands.\nBut it is understood one cancer-related procedure due to take place in the South Eastern Trust area this week has also been cancelled.\nThe Western Trust said it had to delay 39 procedures, but that no cancer surgeries had been cancelled.\nOf those 39, 38 have now either taken place or are booked for a new date.\nIt comes just a month after Health Minister Robin Swann published a three-year recovery plan for rebuilding cancer services post-pandemic. \nSurgery in cancer can be time-critical - the speed at which a patient gets their procedure may have an impact on their prognosis.\nOn Thursday, another 1,471 positive coronavirus cases were reported by the Department of Health - down from 1,600 on Wednesday.\nThis includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the past 24 hours.\nTwo further deaths were also reported.\nThere are 234 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 in hospitals in Northern Ireland. That figure is down from Wednesday's total of 244 patients.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said they \"deeply regret the rescheduling of any surgery and recognise the deep distress caused to patients\".\nThey said the move was \"unavoidable\" given the rise in ICU occupancy and Covid-19 inpatients.\nThe spokesperson said the department remained committed to the aim of maximising elective surgery across the region and the position would be kept under review."

      "tags": "Jonathan Van-Tam,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Around 60,000 deaths have been prevented in England as a result of the Covid vaccine programme, the deputy chief medical officer has said.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam said an estimated 22 million cases have also been stopped - a \"truly massive\" success.\nHis comments came in a special programme with Radio 1 Newsbeat listeners, including some who are worried about getting a jab.\nHe said the more people get a jab, the less likely more lockdowns are. \nThe chances of another lockdown will be \"much lower\" if a higher proportion of the population, including 18-25-year-olds, get their jabs, he said.\nNearly a third of young adults in England - about 2.7 million - have not had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, NHS England figures show.\nSome 68.1% of people aged 18 to 29 had received a first dose by 25 July, according to estimates, meaning 31.9% are likely to not be jabbed.\nProf Van-Tam also said he can't know yet if there will be a fourth wave of Covid infections in the UK.\nHe disputed a claim made to a newspaper by a senior minister earlier this week that Covid was \"all over bar the shouting\", after a recent sharp drop in cases.\nProf Van-Tam said: \"I wish it were so. This is not 'all over bar the shouting'. \n\"I hope the worst is behind us but I think it's quite possible that we're going to have one or two bumpy periods in the autumn and in the winter, not only through Covid, but also through flu and other respiratory viruses as well.\"\nThe estimate of 60,000 deaths avoided because of the vaccine, mentioned by Prof Van-Tam, comes from Public Health England (PHE), and was published shortly after he shared it with Newsbeat.\nThis figure is a bit of an exaggeration.\nThat's because it asks what would happen in a world with no vaccination and no new lockdowns.\nBut it shouldn't be surprising for such a model to suggest that vaccines could have saved many tens of thousands of lives in England alone. \nThe modellers behind the figure looked at the number of infections we've seen since the start of the year. They then asked how many of those infected people would have died if the death rates from 2020 still applied. \nThat alone could account for thousands of deaths.\nVaccines are also thought to have directly averted more than 52,600 hospital admissions, according to PHE.\nPrevious estimates, for the period up to 9 July, had suggested about 37,000 deaths and 11 million infections had been prevented.\nA further 85 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to the government's latest daily figures.\nAnother 31,117 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK on Thursday, lower than the 39,906 cases reported a week earlier.\nAmong those asking Prof Van-Tam questions was Sharnie, 19, a student in Coventry.\nShe asked why someone like her who has had Covid - and only experienced mild cold and flu symptoms - should have a jab when she doesn't know the long-term effects of it.\n\"If there was anything very major going on in terms of side effects and long-term consequences we would have seen those signals and we just haven't,\" Prof Van-Tam said.\nHe added that in the future it could get more difficult for those who haven't been vaccinated to access certain venues and go on holiday.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Tesco,Supermarkets,Freight transport,Coronavirus pandemic,Haulage",
      "text": "Dairy giant Arla, which supplies milk to all major UK supermarkets, has said a lorry driver shortage has forced it to cut back on its deliveries.\nUK managing director Ash Amirahmadi said the firm normally supplied 2,400 stores a day, but had been experiencing driver shortages since early April.\n\"Last Saturday, there were 600 stores that we couldn't deliver milk to,\" he told the BBC.\nHe warned of a summer of disruption and urged the government to act.\n\"It's very worrying for customers when they go into shops and find that the shelves are empty,\" he said.\n\"Our assessment is that we're in a driver shortage crisis and therefore we're asking for the industry and government to work together to recognise we're in a crisis and actually address the issue.\"\nMr Amirahmadi said the government could help the industry by accelerating the programme of driving tests for new HGV drivers, as well as by issuing temporary visas for the road haulage industry, so that more European drivers could be allowed into the country.\nThe Road Haulage Association believes there is currently a shortfall of about 100,000 lorry drivers.\nEarlier this month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours, from nine to 10 hours a day.\nHowever, the RHA said the relaxation was a \"sticking plaster\".\nMr Amirahmadi said: \"Since the beginning of April, we have experienced driver shortages. That has increased to such a level now that we are not able to deliver milk to every store that we'd like to.\n\"Unfortunately at the moment, there's about 10% of the stores every day that we can't deliver to. At the weekend, it's worse.\"\nMr Amirahmadi said the problem was a structural issue that needed a structural solution.\nHe said it would be \"tough and challenging\" to get through the summer.\nThere are indications that the shortage of drivers is pushing up pay rates, with Tesco offering lorry drivers a \u00a31,000 joining bonus.\nArla, through third-party hauliers, had \"significantly increased\" pay, including paying new drivers a \u00a32,000 bonus if they were prepared to work weekends, Mr Amirahmadi said.\nBut with summer holidays approaching, the problem was likely to get worse, he said.\n\"By how much, we cannot fully predict, but I think that's why we really need to take bold action in time for the summer,\" he said.\n\"We're trying to avoid a summer of disruption.\"\nThe driver shortage has combined with the so-called \"pingdemic\" to exacerbate the problem, as large numbers of workers in key sectors have been forced to stay at home after being alerted by the NHS Covid app.\nBut Arla was suffering more from the lack of drivers than from Covid alerts, Mr Amirahmadi said.\n\"Self-isolation doesn't seem to be impacting us as much, because we're a very mechanised, automated business,\" he added.\n\"The food is there in the factories, it's just about getting it to the shops. So that's our key problem.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"We're working with industry and have already taken action on HGV driver shortages, including ramping up vocational test capacity, and funding apprenticeships.\n\"We have also announced a temporary relaxation of drivers' hours rules. This will allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys, but must only be used where necessary and must not compromise driver safety, with further measures to be announced shortly.  \n\"Most of the solutions, however, are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity.\"\nIn July the government announced a package of measures designed to help the industry."
