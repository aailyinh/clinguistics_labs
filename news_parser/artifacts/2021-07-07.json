      "tags": "Schools",
      "text": "Covid rules that have seen hundreds of thousands of pupils miss out on learning due to self-isolation are being axed in England, it is confirmed.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the system of sending \"bubbles\" of children home after a positive case would cease at the end of summer term.  \nThe bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he said.\nTeaching unions warned against easing rules as cases are still rising.\nThe changes to schools guidance will take effect at the same time as the country eases restrictions and moves to stage four. This is expected to be on 19 July - with confirmation of this due next Monday. \nHowever, some schools break up a few days before that.\nThe need for face masks, social distancing measures and staggered start and finish times in schools will be scrapped from September, Mr Williamson said.\nThe Covid testing regime for pupils will be transferred to the NHS track and trace system, Mr Williamson said.\nInstead, secondary schools will be asked to offer pupils two Covid tests at the beginning of the autumn term, as a one-off event.\nThe changes were announced as the latest official statistics for England show the number of pupils out and self-isolating due to Covid hit a record high of 641,000 pupils.  \nOnly 28,000 of these had a confirmed case of Covid-19. \nMr Williamson told the Commons: \"Keeping children in consistent groups was essential to control the spread of the virus when our population was less vaccinated.\n\"We recognise that the system of bubbles and isolation is causing disruption to many children's education. \n\"That is why we'll be ending bubbles and transferring contact tracing to the NHS Test and Trace system for early years settings, schools and colleges.\"\nDepartment for Education figures show that in the autumn term (2020), some 33 million days of school were missed by pupils observing Covid isolation rules.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced that from 16 August under 18s would not have to isolate unless they themselves had tested positive for Covid. \nThis will prevent large numbers of youngsters having to stay at home because they have been in contact with someone who has the virus.\nMr Williamson said: \"I do not think it is acceptable that children should face greater restrictions over and above those of wider society, especially since they have given up so much to keep older generations safe during this pandemic.\"\nHe said: \"Where there are outbreaks schools and colleges may be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and they will also work with local health teams as they currently do now.\n\"We're also setting out new rules that mean from the 16 August children will only need to isolate if they have tested positive for Covid-19.\"\nAlice is a student at Westhoughton High School in Bolton, one of the areas of the country most significantly impacted by Covid. \nShe has had to self-isolate three times this school year and says it has been very difficult to study at home.\n\"I'm really lucky because my mum's a teacher so she's been able to help me on some things, but I've been struggling on how to do the difficult work in isolation,\" says Alice.\n\"It was hard because you're not face-to-face with a teacher - when you're in class teachers can read your facial expressions and tell when you're struggling and they can come and work individually with you.\n\"But when you're at home you're kind of struggling on your own.\"\nAlice has also struggled not seeing her friends.\nShe says being in school is always the best option and makes her feel more confident about her GCSE study. \"I'm not worrying as much,\" she says.\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers, said it was unclear how the changes would prevent disruption from happening.\n\"Removing the requirement for pupils to self-isolate when they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive may well accelerate the spread of the virus in schools and cause even higher levels of disruption for pupils and teachers. \"\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this significant relaxation of measures would be greeted with some trepidation after the past 15 months.\nBut he added that it simply would not be fair to continue with the current controls which have \"blighted the lives of children and young people\", when the adult population was largely vaccinated.\nThe education secretary also said there would be no restrictions on in-person teaching and learning in universities as national restrictions are lifted.\nAnalysis: \nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondent\nThe latest huge increase in pupils being sent home shows the chaos threatening the end of term in England's schools.\nScrapping the bubble system and changing the rules about isolation is intended to reduce the disruption - because as this week's figures show, 96% of those at home because of Covid do not have Covid.\nThis is now about \"managing Covid\" next term rather than expecting it to disappear.\nThere is also another troubling issue revealed by these attendance figures. While more than 641,000 are off school for Covid-related issues there are almost as many again who are absent for other, mostly unexplained, reasons.\nThe non-Covid absence numbers are way higher than would usually be off sick - and it raises questions about whether families are keeping pupils off school or large numbers of children have effectively stopped attending.\nThe reasons, like the risks, are unknown but worrying. But it means more than 1.2 million children are missing from school."

      "tags": "Cash,Pensioners,Department for Work & Pensions,Money,Personal finance,Rishi Sunak,Pensions",
      "text": "Retired people could see a bumper rise in the state pension next year, according to official forecasters.\nPredictions suggest that the link with earnings growth could mean an 8% rise in the amount paid from April 2022.\nThat would cost the government \u00a33bn more than previously expected, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nBut UK state pensions remain less generous than much of Europe, and are vital for millions of people.\nAt present:\nThe rise in pensions each year is one of the most hotly-debated policy decisions for the government and the Treasury.\nIt is governed by what is known as the triple lock - a Conservative manifesto promise until at least 2024.\nThis means the state pension increases in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever of those three is highest.\nNear the end of each year, the government sets the level of state pension to be paid from the following April. It makes the judgement based on data from the Office for National Statistics.\nThe most relevant for the next rise in state pension will be the highest of the three elements of the triple lock, which is likely to be the increasing level of average wages.\nThe OBR is the government's official, but independent, forecaster. Late last year, and early this year, it predicted wages would rise by 4.6%. \nNow, it is expecting the increase to be higher. The Bank of England has suggested it could be an 8% rise.\n\"If earnings growth\u2026 were 8%, that would add around \u00a33bn a year to spending [on the state pension] relative to our forecast,\" the OBR said in its Fiscal Risks Report.\nSo the cost to the taxpayer would be \u00a33bn more than what was already predicted to be a significant rise. The effect continues into subsequent years.\nHowever, that does not mean all pensioners are going to be laughing all the way to the bank.\nThe UK state pension is one of the less generous in Europe. \nFormer pensions minister Sir Steve Webb said it was still \"far from a King's ransom\".\nIn addition, lots of low-paid workers have lost their jobs during the pandemic, the OBR points out. The effect of that trend is that it skews the comparison of wages, meaning that average wages are driven by higher paid workers and rising faster.\nThat means the people who are losing their jobs now, are the very same people who are more likely to rely on the state pension in the future. They will not have built up additional private or workplace pensions.\nWhen asked in October whether the triple lock was safe, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"Yes, our manifesto commitments are there and that is very much the legislative position.\n\"We care very much about pensioners and making sure they have security and that's indeed our policy.\"\nThe government does have an option in law to decide how the calculations are made. If the rise in average wages is considered to be an anomaly, then it could decide to break the link and give a smaller rise to pensioners.\nThe age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer. It is currently 66 for men and women, and the government has plans for the\u00a0increase to 68 to be brought forward."

      "tags": "Pride,LGBT,Christianity",
      "text": "A Church of Ireland minister has resigned his post claiming that the church is \"structurally, culturally and socially homophobic\".\nThe Reverend Andrew Rawding is rector of Brackaville, Donaghendry and Ballyclog in County Tyrone.\nHe announced his resignation in his three parish churches on Sunday morning.\nThe Church of Ireland declined to comment on Mr Rawding's resignation and comments when contacted by BBC News NI. \nMr Rawding said that his parishioners were in shock and some were in tears when he said he was resigning.\nHe told BBC News NI that many had \"expressed sadness\" that he was leaving his role.\nHe has been a Church of Ireland minister for a decade and has previously helped run Pride parades in the mid Ulster area.\nMr Rawding claimed that the Church of Ireland was \"structurally, culturally and socially homophobic\".\n\"There are some kind and compassionate individuals but corporately, at best there is indifference, at worst there is hypocrisy,\" he said.\nHe also claimed that there was \"an aggressive and proactive opposition to full inclusion and equality for LGBT+ people, with some people still weaponising Bible verses and using the language of condemnation and rejection\".\n\"I have made a public stance in the past as a Church of Ireland rector to send a message to the LGBT+ community that it's OK to be LGBT+ and to be a Christian and to show my full support for same-sex marriages within the Church of Ireland,\" he said.\n\"Currently the stance is homophobic and discriminatory.\"\nMr Rawding said he was \"originally motivated\" to make this stance within his parishes. \n\"Although sadly there are still grandparents and relatives who will not accept LGBT children within their own families,\" he added. \nThe Church of Ireland has established a select committee on sexuality to enable \"the listening, dialogue and learning process on all aspects concerning human sexuality in the context of Christian belief to continue\".\nThat committee reported in 2016 and found that how a gay Christian in the Church of Ireland felt they were treated often depended on \"the stance of the rector\".\nThe Church of Ireland synod had previously said that \"members of the Church have at times hurt and wounded people by words and actions, in relation to human sexuality\".\nBut Mr Rawding said that, in his view, the \"listening process\" carried out by the church had been a \"tick-box exercise\".\n\"At no point has anyone in a position of authority within the Church of Ireland been in touch with me or during a conversation with me said: 'Thanks for making a compassionate stand Andrew, let's see how we can progress this',\" he said.\n\"All I have had is blank looks and silence, or comments like: 'I'm not homophobic because I know gay people', or even: 'You need to be careful because people will think you're gay.'\nDissatisfaction with Church's stance had been building\nMr Rawding's resignation came as a surprise, according to his parishioners. Many were in shock and in tears when he announced it.\nHe is someone who has spoken out quite openly in the past for his support for LGBT rights and his disappointment in the church's negative attitude to LGBT people as he saw it.\nHe was one of those behind the first Mid Ulster pride parade, carrying a banner apologising for the church's attitude to LGBT people, so he has been someone who made his views known on the issue for quite a while.\nWhen he had spoken out in the past in support of LGBT rights, he'd had very little or no support from senior church figures.\nLike all Christian denominations, the Church of Ireland has been wrestling with LGBT issues and how to treat members who are LGBT.\nIt does seem like dissatisfaction with the Church of Ireland's stance on LGBT rights has been building up with Mr Rawding for some time.\n\"In my experience, the listening process to LGBT+ people has been a tick-box exercise, being seen to be doing the right thing but not exercising courageous and compassionate leadership.\"\nMr Rawding said there was a very serious issue of self harm and \"suicidal ideation\" within the LGBT community. \n\"Particularly when people in the Church of Ireland and other churches continue to proactively discriminate against LGBT+ people and use the language of 'sin' in relation to not just someone's identity but their very being,\" he added. \nMr Rawding said that he now plans to start a degree in social work.\nHe said that was to \"follow a call to help encourage and empower those people that Jesus called \"the least of these\", that is those adults and children who through no fault of their own have been let down by society and the churches,\" he said.\nIn June, a Presbyterian minister in County Antrim - the Reverend Ian Carton - stood down over that church's decision to deny same-sex couples full membership."

      "text": "The \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit will be \"phased out\" in the autumn, the government has confirmed.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told MPs the boost - introduced in April last year to help deal with the economic effects of Covid - would face an \"adjustment\".\nSix former work and pensions secretaries have urged ministers not to end the uplift.\nMs Coffey said the change had been a \"collective decision\" by ministers.\nThe prime minister said the government is focusing on a \"jobs-led\" recovery from the pandemic, and to \"get people into work\".\nUniversal credit is claimed by more than 5.5 million households in the UK.\nIt was introduced to replace six benefits and merge them into one benefit payment for working-age people.\nThe top up was extended by six months in March and Labour has called for it to continue beyond the autumn.\nCampaigners say the extra money - which is worth around \u00a31,000 a year - has made the difference for some families between getting by and falling further into poverty.\nMs Coffey told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee that it would change this autumn alongside other measures put in place to help those affected by the pandemic.\n\"Ahead of October we will start communicating with the current claimants... to make them aware that will be being phased out and they will start to see an adjustment in their payments,\" she said.\nAsked about universal credit at the Liaison Committee, Boris Johnson said there was a need for \"a different emphasis\" as the country emerged from Covid restraints.\n\"The emphasis has got to be about getting people into work,\" he said adding that job vacancies are back to pre-pandemic levels.\nEarlier this week, six former Conservative work and pensions secretaries wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, urging him not to end the uplift.\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, one of the signatories to the letter, said: \"A failure to act would mean not grasping this opportunity to invest in a future with more work and less poverty and would damage living standards, health and opportunities for some of the families that need our support most as we emerge from the pandemic.\"\nThe uplift in universal credit has been a huge boost to some during the pandemic - adding more than \u00a31,000 to budgets.\nBut it costs billions of pounds. And as the Treasury grapples with the cost of the pandemic, some believe the money should be cut. \nThere are, however, a number of prominent and influential Tories who want it to stay.\nNot just former DWP minister, including Iain Duncan Smith, who brought in universal credit, but also many new Tory MPs, representing northern seats the party won from Labour in 2019. \nThis is going to be a big issue in the coming weeks - and the government is going to come under a lot of pressure - not just from opposition parties. \nBut Ms Coffey said that, just as its introduction last year had been decided collectively by ministers, so was the decision to wind it down.\nThe government's focus was on jobs and \"all the things we can do to help people work more hours\", she added.\nLabour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said the plans would hit the lowest paid hardest and \"hurt our economic recovery\".\n\"There is near universal opposition to this cut, including from prominent Conservatives. It is time the government saw sense, backed struggling families and cancelled their cut to universal credit\", he said."

Is it making sure that the players are getting an early night before a match? Or that they eat a special meal?\nApparently it's a lot simpler than that: he'll just be having a chat.\n\"One thing that stood out for me was, before every game, he would come around and check up on every single player,\" Brendan Galloway tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nThe 25-year-old Plymouth Argyle player was managed by Southgate in the England Under-21 squad, from 2015 to 2017.\n\"He would ask players how they're feeling and that was quite special to me because you could tell that he was a very busy man, but he always wanted them to be in the best state possible before a game.\"\nBrendan says there isn't just a focus on playing football, but creating a fun environment.\n\"It's unique and I think that's what helps the squad to take their mind off it sometimes. \n\"You know, to just go enjoy shooting some hoops or playing some golf or whether it be the unicorns and the pool...\" \nLuke Garbutt is a 28-year-old left back at championship club, Blackpool.\nHe was part of Southgate's U21 squad from 2014 to 2016 and played alongside current England players Luke Shaw, Harry Kane and John Stones.\n\"He was good at managing the group as a whole,\" Luke says.\n\"You have to manage 23 players and make sure they're all happy and feeling involved, or like they're part of the tournament.\"\nLuke says the fact a lot of the England players have grown up with Gareth Southgate as their manager has been a factor in the team's success since he took over.\n\"There's so much continuity in the management, the coaching staff, even the physios - it's like going into a club atmosphere,\" he says.\nBrendan says Southgate also makes sure each player feels they can express themselves and don't change who they are.\nBoth players say Southgate had a calming influence on the Under-21 team.\nLuke says: \"I found him a really good manager to work for, from decision-making and when to bring players on to the right starting line-ups - he was brilliant.\"\nAnd what about rituals before a game? \nBrendan says he always puts on his left boot first - but doesn't know if Southgate has any lucky quirks of his own.\nHowever, it hasn't gone unnoticed that the waistcoats the England manager wore during the World Cup in 2018 haven't made an appearance in the Euros.\n\"I think that he's just got a new look and I think that it suits him,\" Brendan says.\n\"I'm not sure if you can read anything into it though.\" \nSome eagle-eyed fans say for the past few games, Gareth has been wearing an apparently lucky spotted tie. \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "text": "Coronavirus cases in the UK have risen above 30,000 for first time since January, official figures show.\nWednesday's data showed there had been a further 32,548 confirmed Covid cases.\nAnd there were another 33 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nIt comes as Boris Johnson has defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been \"severed\". \nThe prime minister has pledged to scrap most of England's coronavirus regulations at step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, expected on 19 July.\nIt means the government is now braced for a surge in coronavirus cases, possibly around 100,000 a day, as restrictions are lifted.\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was \"certainly true\" there was a \"wave of cases because of the Delta variant\" of the virus.\n\"But scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death,\" he said.\n\"Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic.\"\nHowever, on Monday the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had \"weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link\".\nWednesday's daily figure for Covid cases in the UK is above 30,000 for the first time since 24 January.\nIn terms of hospitalisations, England is seeing more than 330 admissions a day on average at the moment. The most recent day - Monday - saw 416 admitted.\nAs of Wednesday, 2,144 people are in hospital in England with Covid - the first time this figure has topped 2,000 since April.\nWednesday's case total represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. \nIt is not unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend effect - slightly less testing is done.\nWhat's important is the trend. Week on week this represents a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. They are going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week.\nIt's too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this data like hawks.\nThe policy of opening up in England is based on the hope that the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection.\nMinisters have said we should be prepared to see 100,000 cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that.\nBecause while the vaccination programme has weakened the link between cases and hospitalisation, it has not broken it entirely.\nOn current trends that many infections would lead to 2,000 daily admissions - twice what the NHS would normally see in the depths of winter for all types of respiratory illness.\nThe PM has also defended the timescale for ending self-isolation for contacts of Covid, insisting it is a \"sensible approach\".\nThe government has said people who are fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 from 16 August.\nGiving evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson rejected the suggestion 16 August had been chosen because it was when the government expected the population to have reached herd immunity .\n\"That's not the consideration\u2026 it's the time by which we feel that there will have been much more progress on vaccination,\" he said.\nAnd the PM said to do it any sooner would \"effectively be allowing many more people to be vector of disease.\"\n\"All decisions are a balance of risk,\" he said.\nAsked how many people the government expected to end up self-isolating over the next month, he said: \"That will depend on the spread. I haven't seen any data on that. It will depend on the numbers.\"\nMeanwhile, World Health Organization emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan has urged countries to use extreme caution when reopening their economies from Covid restrictions so as \"not to lose the gains you have made\".\nAsked at a briefing if the UK was aiming for herd immunity, Dr Ryan said: \"I'm not aware that that's the logic driving our colleagues in the United Kingdom, I suspect it's not.\nHe said the argument that it was better to infect more people was morally empty and epidemiologically stupid.\nLabour's leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the prime minister he is leading the country into a \"summer of chaos and confusion\" over plans to ease lockdown.\nAt PMQs, he said the country should open up \"in a controlled way\" and urged Mr Johnson to ensure masks still have to be worn on public transport.\nFace masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrapped at the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap. \nThe lifting of rules on 19 July will be confirmed next Monday after a review of the latest data."

      "text": "Two of the world's biggest airlines will trial fast-track lanes at Heathrow airport for fully-vaccinated arrivals.\nUnder the scheme passengers on four routes will be able to upload their vaccination status before boarding.\nThe trial by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic comes as the aviation industry calls for quarantine-free travel to the UK from lower-risk amber list countries.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps is set to announce such a scheme this week.\nThe trial, due to start this weekend, will allow passengers who are fully vaccinated and are travelling on selected flights to Heathrow from Athens, Los Angeles, Montego Bay and New York to show proof of their vaccination status.\nThose taking part in the trial will still have to follow all the rules according to the government's traffic light system; book all the required tests and quarantine if they come from an amber list country. \nPeople taking part will be able to use a dedicated arrivals lane at the UK border.\nIt is hoped the trial will \"reassure\" the government that airlines and airports can check vaccine status away from the border, which would reduce pressure on UK immigration halls.\nThe trial will accept internationally recognised vaccination credentials including the NHS app, CDC card, US state-level digital certification and the EU digital Covid certificate.\nThe move comes just days after the UK government announced that most lockdown measures in England would be eased from 19 July.\nEarlier this week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Mr Shapps would update MPs on international travel and removing \"the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country\".\nHowever, as cases continue to rise in the UK, health experts have highlighted that no vaccines are 100% effective.\nMost popular holiday destinations are currently on the amber list, meaning that people must isolate for up to 10 days on their return to the UK.\nJohn Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told the BBC's Today programme: \"At the moment the main barrier to people who have been doubly vaccinated travelling being allowed to do that, is being able to demonstrate to the government that we can check that they've had the vaccination already.\n\"The trial that we're starting later this week will allow us to demonstrate we can do that safely with 100% checks on double vaccination before people get on the plane.\" \nSean Doyle, British Airways chief executive and chairman, added he was \"confident\" the trial would be successful.\n\"We look forward to providing the data that proves it's simple for fully vaccinated status to be verified and to the Government meeting its commitment to get the country moving again,\" he said.\nShai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, said the trial would demonstrate the industry's readiness to \"rapidly operationalise the new policy, and work with government and authorities to ensure it is smoothly implemented at pace, supporting the reopening of the transatlantic corridor, without which \u00a323 million is lost each day from the UK economy\".\nIn a joint statement, the companies said the UK had \"led the world with its successful vaccine programme\", but added it was \"failing to reap the economic and social rewards\" of other countries which are accepting fully-vaccinated people without the need to quarantine.\nAs other countries open up, airlines are frustrated that international travel from the UK is still limited and that vaccinated travellers aren't treated differently. \nBut there are some practical difficulties involved in introducing the policy; how easily can you check and verify vaccine status at the border of people who have been jabbed around the world and had their records stored in different places?\nSome arrivals will only have paper certificates, others will use different health apps and verifying them could take time. \nAirlines want to show the government that if this policy is introduced, they can do some of these checks before people travel, reducing long queues at the border which are likely to put off travellers. They also want the policy to apply to lots of nationalities, not just people who have been jabbed by the NHS. \nBut exactly how the government might choose to implement this policy is still unknown; it's always said that its international travel policy is guided by protecting public health.\nMeanwhile a self-isolation rule change for fully vaccinated people in England has been delayed until 16 August, provoking concern from some Tory MPs and firms. \nFrom that date, people in England who have had two doses of a coronavirus jab will no longer have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid.\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said the move did not come soon enough - and highlighted the \"carnage\" caused by the current system, which forced pub and restaurant staff to self-isolate \"unnecessarily\".\nFormer Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told the Telegraph: \"Why would you even go to a pub (after step four of the lifting of lockdown)? This makes it worse.\"\n\"I wouldn't go to a pub that wasn't still having six around a table and social distancing, otherwise you run the risk of everyone in the pub being pinged and locked down.\"\nOn Tuesday, another 28,773 cases were reported across the UK, as well as 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAccording to Health Secretary Sajid Javid, the numbers of new infections could rise to 100,000-a-day over the summer,"

      "tags": "Policing,Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Criminal justice system",
      "text": "Proposals for England and Wales mean people who claim to have been raped will still face pressure to hand over their phones to police and prosecutors, says the victims' commissioner.\nThe government's apology to rape victims has been \"undermined\" by the move, Dame Vera Baird told the BBC. \nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill sets limits to police access to victims' phone data. \nBut these safeguards should be stronger, argues Dame Vera. \nThe Home Office says there will be a code of practice alongside the new law to protect the privacy of victims and witnesses. \nLast month, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to rape victims for low conviction rates in England and Wales and promised \"to do a lot better\". \nBut Dame Vera warns that while the proposed legislation requires police to get the agreement of potential rape victims to hand over their phones or other personal data such as medical records, it does not define exactly what \"agreement\" means. \nNor does it set limits on what information can be downloaded from phones, nor how it might be used. \n\"It is definitely a backward step,\" says Dame Vera, \"and it definitely clashes with the apology from ministers and with the intention in the rape review to focus on the defendant and less on the complainant.\"\nVictims of sexual crimes are often put under pressure by police and prosecutors to hand over their phones because of the possibility they might have sent private messages which undermine their evidence.\nThis is voluntary, but victims are often told the case will be closed if they do not comply, and some withdraw because they are uncomfortable handing over private data. \nSarah Jenkin has taken the rare step of waiving her legal right to anonymity because of her anger at the way she was treated after alleging she had been raped. \nShe had been drinking heavily and was unable to give a detailed account of what had happened. The man whom she accused denied rape.\nSarah said the police had not initially wanted to access her phone but later said it was necessary. \n\"I got the impression that it had been requested that the police get that information. Requested by, I assume, the CPS...\n\"I feel very angry about what has happened, the trauma that I've suffered directly from the treatment of particular aspects of the criminal justice system is unbelievable.\"\nSarah said the CPS claimed there were inconsistencies in her messages to friends.\n\"They seemed, certainly in my case, to be using this information as a way to try to discredit me, discredit my account, imply that I'm not a credible witness.\"\nHowever, she said, her personal messages would have also made it clear she was gay, and had no history with men, suggesting it was unlikely she would have consented to sex. \n\"This was something that I raised with the CPS only to be told that my sexuality wasn't relevant, which was very hurtful,\" she told the BBC. \nThe case was dropped by the CPS after prosecutors said they would offer no evidence. The man she accused was acquitted.\nEven a tighter law, to protect victims of crime, would only go so far in restoring her trust in the justice system, she said. \nA Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said the case was stopped after a \"careful review\" because it did not meet the legal test required for a prosecution. \n\"Every rape case that comes to the CPS is dealt with by a specialist prosecutor in a dedicated rape and sexual offences unit. \n\"Each one is decided on its own merits and whenever the legal test is met, we will not hesitate to prosecute.\" \nPolice forces have already ditched a process for obtaining large amounts of phone data, described by campaigners as a \"digital strip-search\". \nBut recent research for the government's review of rape cases, suggested it was often prosecutors, rather than police officers, who pushed for victims' data, to enable \"robust\" charging decisions.\nIn a statement, the Home Office said the new law would \"outline the general duties\" of police and prosecutors but there would also be a code of practice on how the powers should be used, to protect the privacy of victims and witnesses.\nWork is underway to ensure the criminal justice system only takes information from victims \"where it is necessary for the investigation and not as a matter of course,\" said an official.  \nDame Vera says that, behind the scenes, senior police officers support her attempts to protect victims.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has, in the past, been accused of investigating the person reporting a rape or sexual assault, rather than the suspect, and of trying to prevent cases going to court if they are less likely to result in a conviction.\nThis was one of the reasons why the government, through Mr Buckland, apologised to rape victims. \nThe government's rape review concluded: \"These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed.\" \n\"Victims of rape are being failed.\""

      "text": "Dilip Kumar, one of India's earliest and most famous film actors, has died in Mumbai at the age of 98. \nA veritable legend, Kumar acted in more than 65 films over nearly five decades, playing roles that ranged from the iconic to the endearing. \nHe was admitted to hospital on 30 June after he complained of breathlessness. He had been frequently ill for months.\nKumar is survived by his wife, Saira Banu, a Bollywood actress herself. The couple have no children. \nHis burial will take place at 17:00 local time (11:30 GMT). Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the funeral would happen with state honours. \nMr Thackeray and several Bollywood stars, including Shah Rukh Khan and Ranbir Kapoor, visited Kumar's family to pay their condolences.\nTributes have been pouring in on social media for the legendary actor - politicians, Bollywood stars and even historians have tweeted. \nDilip Kumar was born Yusuf Khan in December 1922 in Peshawar - in what is now Pakistan - before the partition of India. \nLike some of his Muslim contemporaries, he took on a Hindu name - Dilip Kumar - when he joined the Hindi film industry. \nHe debuted in 1944 in Jwaar Bhata but it was the 1949 hit, Andaz, that shot him to fame. The blockbuster love triangle also starred Nargis and Raj Kapoor, who went on to become celebrated actors. \nKumar's biographer Lord Meghnad Desai compares him to Hollywood great Marlon Brando or Italian legend Marcello Mastroianni.\n\"Dilip Kumar was arguably the best actor Indian cinema has produced. There are stars, some even bigger than him, but no better actor. He was the finest tragic actor of his days but also succeeded at comedy,\" he told the BBC.\nSome of his films - Mela, Naya Daur, Ganga Jumna, Devdas and Mughal-e-Azam - were superhits and won him legions of fans.\nKumar essayed a gamut of roles, including a villager, a suave urbanite, a Bengali gentleman and a swashbuckling hero, before moving to paying older, supporting roles in the 1970s, Mr Desai said.\n\"More than his list of films and his box office popularity, Dilip Kumar reflected India's political and social evolution through his films,\" he said. \"As independent India grew, prospered, ran into difficulties and faced challenges, Dilip Kumar's roles told the story as it unfolded.\" \nKumar was honoured with prestigious film awards and two of India's highest civilian awards. \nHe married Saira Banu in 1966 - the two starred together in several hit films. Kumar last appeared in a film in 1998. "

This is only 0.5% of all hospital admissions.\nThere were 55 patients with a confirmed positive Covid test in hospital beds on Tuesday. The daily average is up from 26 last week to 39.  In mid-March, there was an average of 300 confirmed patients with Covid.\nThere were seven Covid patients in critical care or on ventilation on Tuesday, split between Betsi Cadwaldr, Cardiff and Vale and Hywel Dda hospitals. Critical care patients with other conditions outnumber Covid patients by more than 20 to one.\nAs expected, case numbers are still rising, driven by clusters in Wrexham, Flintshire and Cardiff.\nRhos and Johnstown South in Wrexham has the highest case rate when we break down Wales into similar-sized communities. Positive tests are running at 10 a day there. \nWrexham's case rate is now around 255 cases per 100,000 - the 123rd highest in the UK. \nSeven of its 18 districts have case rates above 200 per 100,000. Altogether around 50 communities across Wales are above 200 per 100,000.\nWales' overall case rate is 109.6 cases per 100,000 - still less than all other UK nations and English regions.\nMerthyr Tydfil, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire are among the lowest for case rates in the UK.\nJust under 60% of all positive tests in the latest daily reported results were among people under 30.\nThere were no further deaths reported.\nThere were 65 positive Covid tests in elderly care homes in Wales in the latest week - the highest number since mid-March.\nThere were 23 more in the week beginning 28 June than positive results which came back in the week before\nBack in early-January, the number hit 1,500 positive tests in the peak week. \nRoutine weekly testing of both residents and staff in care homes re-started last September and it is continuing on scientific advice, despite the vaccination programme having now given full doses to 94.6% of residents and 87.7% of staff. \nAcross Wales, about 29,100 residents and staff were tested in the latest week. Positive tests do not necessarily mean the person is ill or showing symptoms, just that a positive result has come from a routine test."

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has warned Boris Johnson he is leading the country into a \"summer of chaos and confusion\" over measures to ease lockdown.\nThe Labour leader asked the PM how many would have to isolate if Covid infections hit 100,000 per day.\nAnd he expressed concern that people would delete the test and trace app to avoid being told to self isolate.\nMr Johnson insisted his plan to lift Covid rules was \"balanced and reasonable\".\nHowever, the prime minister failed to put a number on how many would need to self-isolate, nor an estimate of the deaths and hospitalisations expected as infections rise.\nOn Monday, Mr Johnson said that most legal restrictions in England should be removed from 19 July.\nThe lifting of rules - which will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data - would include scrapping social distancing rules as well as the legal requirement to wear face masks.\nAnd the government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England.\nBut ministers have warned the public to expect high infection levels as the remaining restrictions are lifted.\nAddressing the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said the country should open up \"in a controlled way\" and urged Mr Johnson to ensure masks still have to be worn on public transport.\nHe argued that removing all protections \"in one go\" was reckless and said higher infection rates would lead to \"a greater chance of new variants emerging\".\nHe also warned that, with infections projected to rise, many more people would have to isolate, whilst others would simply chose to delete the test and trace app to avoid being \"pinged\".\n\"It won't feel like freedom day to those who have to isolate... it won't feel like freedom day to the businesses who are already warning of carnage because of the loss of staff and customers.\" he said.\nThe prime minister responded that the country would be \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\". \nHe acknowledged cases were rising but said \"scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death\" as a result of the vaccine roll out. \nThis slightly differs from Sir Patrick Vallance's comments at a press conference on Monday when the government's chief scientific advisor said the link had been \"weakened\" but not \"completely broken\".\nOn face masks, Mr Johnson said the government was \"cautiously moving from a legal diktat to allowing people to take personal responsibility for their actions\".\nHe said if the only difference between the two politicians was over whether face masks should be mandatory \"that is good news\".\nSir Keir questioned why the prime minister deemed the use of masks on transport \"common sense\" but wouldn't make it mandatory. \n\"It's clear what this is all about, he's lost a health secretary, he's lost a by-election, he's getting flack from his own MPs, so he's doing what he always does: crashing over to the other side of the aisle, chasing headlines and coming up with a plan that hasn't been thought through,\" he said.\nMr Johnson hit back accusing the Labour leader of failing to be clear about his own position saying: \"We vaccinate, they vacillate, we inoculate, while they're invertebrate.\"\nThis is a huge change that is about to come - after more than a year of living with all of these restrictions in England.\nSince the government's announcement on Monday, there's been really intense political, scientific and medical debate about whether it's the right thing to do or not.\nWhat was interesting is that at PMQs Kier Starmer was trying to get the same information that journalists have been trying to get from the government, in the last few days. \nWhat does the government expect in terms of new hospitalizations?\nWhat does the government expect in terms of the number of people who may lose their lives over the next couple of months?\nBoris Johnson, just didn't want to give those figures.\nYou may have heard the Health Secretary Sajid Javid say we might be looking at 50,000 cases a day. We might even be looking at 100,000 cases a day. \nBut the government just won't release the extra information and Keir Starmer didn't get anywhere with that. "

      "tags": "Egypt,Global trade,Shipping industry,Suez canal",
      "text": "A huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March - disrupting global trade - is finally leaving the waterway after Egypt signed a compensation deal with its owners and insurers.\nThe Ever Given weighed anchor shortly after 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) and headed north towards the Mediterranean escorted by tugs.\nThe ship has been impounded for three months near the canal city of Ismailia.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed but Egypt had demanded $550m (\u00a3397m).\nAs it got under way, Egyptian TV showed footage of the captain and a crew member being presented with flowers and a plaque on board the ship.\nThe 193km (120-mile) Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea at the canal's northern end to the Red Sea in the south and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.\nBut the vital waterway was blocked when the 400m-long (1,312ft) Ever Given became wedged across it after running aground amid high winds. Global trade was disrupted as hundreds of ships were stuck in the traffic jam.\nThe container ship was refloated following a six-day salvage operation that involved a flotilla of tug boats and dredging vessels. One person was killed during the operation.\nSince then, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) has been seeking compensation from the Ever Given's Japanese owner Shoei Kisen for the cost of the salvage operation, damage to the canal's banks and other losses.\nThe SCA initially asked for $916m compensation, including $300m for a salvage bonus and $300m for loss of reputation. But UK Club - which insured Shoei Kisen for third-party liabilities - rejected the claim, describing it as \"extraordinarily large\" and \"largely unsupported\".\nThe SCA later lowered its demand to $550m. The final settlement, which has not been revealed, was agreed a few days ago and signed on Wednesday to coincide with the ship's release.\nBy Sally Nabil, BBC News, Suez Canal\nJournalists were taken on a tugboat to film the Ever Given finally resuming its voyage along the Suez Canal. As we watched the giant vessel sail past, everybody felt relieved. After more than three months, the story was coming to an end.\nI remembered the scene back in March, when the ship was wedged across the waterway, bringing navigation to a stand-still for six days and disrupting global trade. Those days were quite tense and full of uncertainty. On Wednesday, the atmosphere was one of cheerfulness. \nHowever, so far no-one knows what caused this whole saga. Investigations were carried out, but the findings have not been announced. At a news conference, Suez Canal Authority chairman Osama Rabie said the ship was the sole responsibility of its master. \nThe details of the financial settlement between the SCA and the ship's owners and insurers have also not been revealed. Mr Rabie refused to even give a rough estimate of how much of a compensation the SCA received. \nSCA head Osama Rabie told a news conference that the authority would not change its rules about the passage of ships in bad weather. However, he said the grounding had accelerated plans for the canal's expansion. \nThe UK Club paid tribute to \"the work and expertise of the SCA and others whose professionalism and dedication resulted in the ship being refloated\".\n\"Over the last three months we, along with the ship's owners and other interests, have worked closely with the SCA's negotiations team to achieve today's results,\" a statement said.\nYukito Higaki of Imabari shipbuilding, of which Shoei Kisen is a subsidiary, said the company would continue to be \"a regular and loyal customer\" of the Suez Canal Authority.\nThe vessel, with an Indian crew, is still loaded with about 18,300 containers. It is due to undergo an inspection by divers at Port Said before sailing to Rotterdam in the Netherlands and then to the UK port of Felixstowe where it will offload its containers, the Wall Street Journal reported."

      "text": "The Home Office is being urged to extend its new Hong Kong visa scheme to include thousands of young people who may be targets of the Beijing regime.  \nA report by MPs on the Home Affairs Committee said a loophole meant many 18 to 23-year-olds who participated in pro-democracy demonstrations cannot apply for the right to come to Britain. \nSome 36,000 Hong Kongers have already applied for the special visas.\nThe government said those not eligible could come to the UK via other routes.\nSince 31 January, Hong Kong residents have been able to come to the UK for up to five years and apply for permanent residency.\nThe UK introduced the British National (Overseas), or BNO, visa after China passed a wide-ranging new security law for Hong Kong which made it easier to punish protesters and reduces the city's autonomy. The UK said the law was an erosion of freedoms and rights.\nNow, more than 5 million Hong Kongers are eligible to move to the UK.\nThe Home Affairs Committee said that while it welcomed the programme, it did not go far enough because people over the age of 18 and born after the Hong Kong handover in 1997 may be ineligible.\nThis is despite that age group making up a significant number of the pro-democracy activists who are vulnerable to political targeting.   \nThe cross-party group of MPs is now urging ministers to extend the scheme to enable a young person with a BNO parent to apply separately, provided there is evidence of that parent's status.\nThe report also noted that while young people facing imprisonment by the Chinese authorities could seek asylum in the UK, many were deterred by long delays in processing applications.  \nA Home Office spokesman said the BNO visa route reflected the \"UK's historic and moral commitment to those people of Hong Kong who chose to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BNO status\". \n\"It is an unprecedented and generous offer reflecting our deep connection with Hong Kong,\" he said.\n\"Those not eligible for this route can come to the UK through other routes, such as through the points-based system or the youth mobility scheme.\"\nHe added that the UK has a \"proud record of providing protection for those who need it, where there is a well-founded fear of persecution\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The planned dates for easing Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland are \"not set in stone\", Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe first minister said it would not be responsible to have a guaranteed timetable in the face of the virus, after another day of high case numbers.\nScotland is due to move to level zero on 19 July, before dropping almost all restrictions on 9 August.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said she would look very carefully at the latest data before confirming this would happen.\nThe Scottish Parliament is to be recalled from recess on 13 July for MSPs to be updated on whether the timetable will go ahead as planned.\nA further 3,799 cases of Covid-19 were recorded in Scotland on Wednesday, breaking a trend of five consecutive days where numbers fell from the record highs seen the previous week.\nMs Sturgeon said case numbers were \"much higher than we want them to be\", but said it could still be the case that the recent increase was stabilising.\nShe said: \"We are literally monitoring the data on a daily basis right now, as we head towards the review point next week where we will be able to say what our plans are for 19 July.\n\"We are looking at this very carefully. My biggest concern right now is that even though we are seeing a weakening of the link between cases and hospitalisations, if we have a high number of cases even a lower proportion of those cases ending up in hospital can put pressure on our NHS.\"\nThe first minister said restrictions would ultimately be eased, with the vaccine programme providing a clear route out of lockdown, but said it was important to do this \"at a sensible pace\".\nAsked if this meant the dates set out in the government's latest route map out of lockdown were not set in stone, she replied: \"Nothing, against a global pandemic of an infectious virus that has got more infectious and transmissible with the Delta variant, can be set in stone.\n\"I want as much as everybody does the certainty of 'by this date we will be free of everything and there will no longer be any restrictions'.\n\"Every part of me wants that and every part of me believes we are on a journey towards that and heading in that direction.\n\"But to set dates in stone while we still face that virus would not in my view be responsible. My job is to take hard decisions that get us as safely as possible to that end point.\"\nMeanwhile, opposition parties voiced alarm at the performance of the Test and Protect contact tracing system, after figures suggested it had fallen below the benchmark set for it by ministers.\nThe government wants the service to have completed contact tracing in 80% of cases within 72 hours of their being logged in the system.\nHowever the latest report from Public Health Scotland suggested that 26.8% of cases in the five days to 2 July had taken more than three days to close - down from 34.9% the previous week.\nScottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said the system was clearly \"completely overwhelmed\" by the recent surge in cases.\nShe added: \"A robust Test and Protect system remains a critical tool in fighting the virus, but the SNP government have failed to ensure it has all the resources it needs.\"\nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the Scottish government had \"lost control of the pandemic\", saying: \"Test and trace is in disarray and cases are spiralling - we cannot have the people of Scotland put in danger due to the failure of the SNP.\"\nContact tracers are now regularly facing as many cases in a day as they had to deal with in a week earlier in the pandemic.\nThey have moved to prioritise telephone interviews with cases where there is a \"high risk\" of transmissions, with many other people who test positive contacted via text message and asked to fill out an online form.\nMs Sturgeon acknowledged last week that the system was \"under pressure\" due to the surge in cases, but insisted it was \"coping well\".\nIt came after NHS Grampian warned that the increase in cases meant it would not be able to trace the contacts of everyone who tests positive."

      "text": "Wales' festivals could be \"left behind\" if no date is given for ending Covid restrictions, organisers of the Royal Welsh Show have said.\nEngland has a target of 19 July and Scotland plans to lift remaining legal restrictions on 9 August, but no date has been given in Wales. \nSteve Hughson said Wales' \"cautious approach\" was now becoming untenable. \nEconomy Minister Vaughan Gething said ministers would not \"blow the doors off\" to lift rules at the same time.\nThere have only been minor changes to Covid rules in Wales since the start of June, after First Minister Mark Drakeford announced a pause in order to \"reduce the peak number of daily hospital admissions\" and allow time to vaccinate more people.\nSince 7 June, large outdoor events, such as concerts, football matches and organised runs, have been able to go ahead for crowds of up to 4,000 people standing or 10,000 people sitting down.\nOrganisers must undertake full risk assessments and put in place measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, including social distancing.\nThe 2021 Royal Welsh Show is being held virtually for a second year, but organisers hope it will return to Llanelwedd near Builth Wells in Powys in 2022.  \nMr Hughson, chief executive of the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society, said: \"The differences across the border are causing frustration, commercial disadvantage and confusion with people coming across the border.\n\"We need Welsh government to take a long hard look and there is a lot of pressure for them to do something in the next weeks and months to align.\n\"There's a fear that Wales will be left behind, or left on its own.\n\"I congratulate Welsh government for its cautious approach and vaccine rollout, which has left it with some of the best numbers in the UK, but that cautious approach is now becoming untenable. \n\"We can no longer rely on this when England and Scotland are open for business.\"\nJoe Worley is the co-founder of Westival festival near Manobier in Pembrokeshire.\nThe 2021 event had been planned from 22-26 July, but has been moved to 2022.\nHe said: \"They've said festivals can go ahead if they're socially distanced, but what's been frustrating is the lack of advice and guidance on how to actually do that.\"\nThe planned restriction end dates in England and Scotland have left him with mixed emotions: \"Obviously I'm really, really happy that those things [festivals in England and Scotland] are going to go ahead, it means that a lot of people do get like a festival kind of summer, but I guess it is frustrating to see that we've kind of not followed suit.\n\"We've vaccinated more people than anyone else in the UK so it seems like we should be ahead of England, if anything.\"\nEm Weirdigan is festival director of Green Gathering near Chepstow in Monmouthshire, which has been postponed to August 2022.\nShe said: \"We're hugely disappointed but we don't blame the Welsh government for focusing more heavily on health than economics and we understand the regulations are designed to keep people in Wales safe.\"\nShe said it was a \"shame there wasn't scope for flexibility\", adding: \"We had plans to run what we believe would have been a safe festival, with outdoor stages on a site renowned for its wide open spaces. \n\"We won't be defeated and will return to Chepstow.\"\nJoseph Fort is the co-artistic director of October's Cowbridge Music Festival in the Vale of Glamorgan.\nHe said they had planned for three different scenarios - 2m social distancing, 1m social distancing and no restrictions.\nIf distancing is in place, they plan to run each event twice.\nHe said planning had been \"tricky\" but they had received a lot of support: \"The British Association of Festivals have been really helpful and the key thing we've done is talk to everybody else doing other festivals - everybody seems to be taking different gambles, but we're all looking at what each other are doing and talking to each other a lot.\"\nHe does not think having a lockdown end date in Wales would have helped: \"I think that the English guidelines kind of give the illusion of security... we may have to have further lockdown in the autumn.\n\"In October, wherever the festival was, there are just still so many unknowns that we don't just don't really know.\"\nBut head of Wales at the Federation of Small Businesses Ben Cottam said it was really important \"that the first minister now comes up with a timeline\". \n\"Welsh government has to move on the public health data that it has available, but it is really important that businesses have a time scale to plan to,\" he added.\nThe UK government's Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he agreed with Mr Cottam, adding: \"I think if Wales is considerably out of step with the rest of the UK, people in Wales will want to know what the what the reasoning is behind that.\"\nHe also acknowledged it was a devolved matter and \"up to the Welsh government\".\nWelsh Economy Minister Vaughan Gething told the Senedd decisions would be driven by data.\nOn calls to end social distancing to help businesses, Mr Gething said: \"I am optimistic about the choices that we will get to make. \n\"But we do so in a manner that is responsible, and not driven by demands to simply blow the doors off and allow everything to happen at the same time, as in other parts of the United Kingdom.\"  \nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"Decisions on the way forward on any further relaxation of restrictions on events will be taken as part of the regular 21-day review process.\n\"The onus is on the event organiser, in this instance the director, to undertake a full risk assessment and put in place any necessary mitigations.\""

We don't know how he would actually react to somebody going that close.\"\nWhile a minority of people have distressed the walrus, Linda explained that \"99% of the people have been amazing. They just want the experience to see a walrus in our waters\".\nNow that Wally has moved on, Tenby no longer has its local celebrity, but Linda said \"it's been great for the town since Wally's been here\".\n\"After the difficult times of Covid and lockdown Wally appearing here has just been fantastic,\" she added.\nThis view was shared by many of the towns small businesses - who rely almost solely on the 4.2m visitors who flock to the area each year, according to Visit Pembrokeshire.\nJohn Mather, who owns The Nook gift shop, said: \"It's just been great after the difficult times of Covid and lockdown Wally appearing here has just been fantastic.\"\nJust a few days after Wally arrived in March, one of Mr Mather's suppliers suggested making cushions featuring a walrus.\nHe agreed and when they \"flew off the shelves\" he immediately ordered more.\nHe and other shops have since branched out into postcards, pictures, mugs and T-shirts, which all feature Wally.\nHe told BBC Wales: \"We've had people coming here from all over the country just solely to see the walrus.\n\"And then coming and visiting our shops which has been fantastic.\n\"It's good for the whole town. People come, they stay here, they're eating in the restaurants, they're using the takeaways - it's really good.\"\nAs well as memorabilia, Wally's fame has led to Tenby's Harbwr brewery to name a beer in his honour.\nTamar's Tusk also pays tribute to the Tamar class of lifeboat which the town's RNLI station uses."

      "tags": "Cash,Pensioners,Department for Work & Pensions,Money,Personal finance,Rishi Sunak,Pensions",
      "text": "Retired people could see a bumper rise in the state pension next year, according to official forecasters.\nPredictions suggest that the link with earnings growth could mean an 8% rise in the amount paid from April 2022.\nThat would cost the government \u00a33bn more than previously expected, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nBut UK state pensions remain less generous than much of Europe, and are vital for millions of people.\nAt present:\nThe rise in pensions each year is one of the most hotly-debated policy decisions for the government and the Treasury.\nIt is governed by what is known as the triple lock - a Conservative manifesto promise until at least 2024.\nThis means the state pension increases in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever of those three is highest.\nNear the end of each year, the government sets the level of state pension to be paid from the following April. It makes the judgement based on data from the Office for National Statistics.\nThe most relevant for the next rise in state pension will be the highest of the three elements of the triple lock, which is likely to be the increasing level of average wages.\nThe OBR is the government's official, but independent, forecaster. Late last year, and early this year, it predicted wages would rise by 4.6%. \nNow, it is expecting the increase to be higher. The Bank of England has suggested it could be an 8% rise.\n\"If earnings growth\u2026 were 8%, that would add around \u00a33bn a year to spending [on the state pension] relative to our forecast,\" the OBR said in its Fiscal Risks Report.\nSo the cost to the taxpayer would be \u00a33bn more than what was already predicted to be a significant rise. The effect continues into subsequent years.\nHowever, that does not mean all pensioners are going to be laughing all the way to the bank.\nThe UK state pension is one of the less generous in Europe. \nFormer pensions minister Sir Steve Webb said it was still \"far from a King's ransom\".\nIn addition, lots of low-paid workers have lost their jobs during the pandemic, the OBR points out. The effect of that trend is that it skews the comparison of wages, meaning that average wages are driven by higher paid workers and rising faster.\nThat means the people who are losing their jobs now, are the very same people who are more likely to rely on the state pension in the future. They will not have built up additional private or workplace pensions.\nWhen asked in October whether the triple lock was safe, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"Yes, our manifesto commitments are there and that is very much the legislative position.\n\"We care very much about pensioners and making sure they have security and that's indeed our policy.\"\nThe government does have an option in law to decide how the calculations are made. If the rise in average wages is considered to be an anomaly, then it could decide to break the link and give a smaller rise to pensioners.\nThe age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer. It is currently 66 for men and women, and the government has plans for the\u00a0increase to 68 to be brought forward."

Passengers on selected flights - from Athens, Los Angeles, Montego Bay and New York - will be able to upload their vaccination status before boarding. From this weekend people flying with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic on the chosen flights will use a dedicated arrivals lane at the UK border. The airlines said the UK had led the world with its successful vaccine programme but was \"failing to reap the economic and social rewards\" of other countries which are accepting fully-vaccinated people without quarantine. The government is set to make an announcement about quarantine-free travel from lower-risk amber list countries.\nThe government must clearly communicate Covid rule changes to ensure the public feels confident about the easing of restrictions, psychologists say. The government must explain clearly why the rules are no longer necessary but research suggests using nuanced language, acknowledging uncertainty and being empathetic are important. While most people support most public health decisions made on Covid, the public is likely to take Covid less seriously once restrictions are lifted.\nPoor service \"because of Covid\" is leaving customers fed up, according to research. They were initially tolerant of delays as businesses coped with the pandemic but that excuse doesn't seem to wash any more. Complaints are at the highest level for 12 years, the UK Institute of Customer Service finds, with firms being accused of using the pandemic as an excuse for long waits on the telephone or late deliveries. The sectors with the biggest issues were transport and local public services. \"Saying 'because of Covid' is not a good phrase,\" said Jo Causon, the institute's chief executive. \"Organisations must not hide behind this blanket statement.\"\n\"If you had a map of Covid's biggest effects now and a map of child deaths in 1850, they look remarkably similar,\" Prof Chris Whitty told an NHS conference in June. Healthcare in the England  and Wales has vastly improved since Victorian times, yet the geography of coronavirus deaths closely follows the pattern of poor health in the 19th Century. Studies have found a link between Covid-19 and poverty, with the latest describing a \"jaw-dropping\" fall in life expectancy in Greater Manchester due to the pandemic. We've mapped out the figures, take a look.\nLive music is attempting a comeback for the first time in about 18 months - since when restrictions came into force to curb coronavirus. It's not arenas or stadiums where big stars like Rag 'n' Bone Man and Sir Tom Jones will be playing - they and other stars will be performing in some of the UK's smallest venues. Read more about the Revive Live scheme, which ambassador Jo Whiley says will kick-start the return of live music.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs millions of people gear up for England's Euro 2020 semi-final against Demark later, here's a guide to watching the football match with Covid restrictions in place.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Britney Spears' court-appointed lawyer offers to resign",
      "tags": "Britney Spears,Music",
      "text": "Britney Spears' court-appointed lawyer has asked to resign from his role, as the fallout from the pop star's dramatic court testimony continues.\nSamuel Ingham has represented the singer since she was placed under a conservatorship in 2008.\nBut in a public statement to the court last month, Spears said he discouraged her from speaking out, and that she wanted to chose her own legal team.\nMr Ingham's announcement came after Spears' manager also stepped down.\nThe lawyer revealed his desire to resign in court papers filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\"Samuel D Ingham III hereby resigns as court-appointed counsel for Britney Jean Spears, conservatee, effective upon the appointment of new court-appointed counsel,\" the request said.\nLoeb and Loeb, a law firm brought in to help Mr Ingham, also offered its resignation in the filing.\nNeither party explained why they wanted to step down, but the move came less than two weeks after Spears described her conservatorship, a legal guardianship arrangement, as \"abusive\" and said she was \"traumatised\". \nIn a 23-minute statement to the court last month, the singer claimed she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children, and asked the court to end the conservatorship that has governed her life for the last 13 years.\nAlthough she had \"built a relationship\" with Mr Ingham in that time, she said he had been \"scared for me to go forward\" with her testimony.\n\"He told me I should keep it to myself,\" she said, adding that she would like the opportunity \"to actually handpick my own lawyer by myself\".\nMr Ingham appeared to be taken aback by the star's statement - telling the court he was unaware of its contents before she spoke. He added that he would step aside as her representative if asked.\nAccording to the most recent accounting available, in 2019 Mr Ingham was paid about $373,000 (\u00a3270,000) for working with the singer. Spears pays the legal costs for both sides in her conservatorship case.\nHe is the third party involved in Spears' conservatorship to step aside in the past week.\nThe star's long-time manager Larry Rudolph resigned earlier this week, saying he had been informed of her \"intention to officially retire\" from the music industry.\nMr Rudolph had worked with Spears since her breakthrough with ...Baby One More Time in 1998 - although he said he had not been in contact with her for the last two-and-a-half years due to her work hiatus.\nAnd last week, financial management firm the Bessemer Trust, which was appointed to help oversee Spears' financial affairs, requested to resign from that role, citing her desire for the conservatorship to stop.\nSpears has not yet made a formal request for the court to review the arrangement. The next hearing is scheduled for 14 July.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "title": "BBC star salaries: Gary Lineker still BBC's top earner despite pay cut",
      "tags": "Television,BBC,Radio",
      "text": "Gary Lineker remains the BBC's top earner despite agreeing to a pay cut of just under \u00a3400,000, the broadcaster has revealed in its annual report.\nLast year it was announced the Match of the Day host had agreed to his wages being reduced.\nTuesday's report showed he earned \u00a31.36m in the 2020/21 financial year, down from \u00a31.75m.\nRadio 2's Zoe Ball, who also took a pay cut after offering to do so, is still the second-highest paid star on \u00a31.13m.\nLast year she earned the same as Lineker's earnings in the latest financial year - \u00a31.36m.\nHer current salary is actually \u00a3980,000, a reduction of 28% from 2019/2020 - the \u00a31.13m figure takes into account her wages before she took the pay cut towards the end of last year.\nThe wage bill for all on-air talent overall has been cut by 10% to \u00a3130m - down from \u00a3144m last year. Wages for broadcasters earning more than \u00a3150,000 have been reduced by \u00a32.2m.\nThe BBC's director general Tim Davie said most of the renegotiations about pay with top stars had been \"mutual and constructive\".\n\"Clearly, as a management team, we want to get more value and we're willing to make tough decisions to that extent,\" he said.\n\"But I think these conversations have all been constructive - as with Zoe Ball when she came forward and said she wanted to adjust her salary. I think everyone is absolutely with the programme on that one.\"\nHe added that \"we should maintain restraint in pay across the top talent\" and would \"continue to look for efficiency\" savings in the future.\nBut Conservative MP Julian Knight, who is the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS), said: \"It's welcome that some of the BBC's top-earners have agreed to 'significant reductions' in their salaries this year. Yet despite taking a pay cut, Gary Lineker is still earning \u00a31.36 million.\"\nFive of the six top earners - including Steve Wright, Huw Edwards and Question Time anchor Fiona Bruce - now earn less than they did last year. Radio 5 Live presenter Stephen Nolan, in joint-fifth place, saw his salary increased by \u00a315,000.\nFour women - Ball, Bruce, Radio 2's Vanessa Feltz and Lauren Laverne of 6 Music - make the top 10, the same number as last year.\nThere are 31 women on the list and 40 men, a split of 44%/56%, despite the previous director general Tony Hall pledging that the gap would be closed by 2020.\nAgain like last year, all of the top 10 earners are white. While 20% of all presenters earning over \u00a3150,000 are from ethnic minority backgrounds, up from 18% last year, the overall staff pay gap for minorities has widened slightly.\nGraham Norton, who left his Radio 2 show in December 2020, dropped out of the top 10 entirely. The star earned \u00a3150,000 in 2020/2021.\nHe also fronts the BBC's Eurovision coverage - although the event was cancelled last year due to the pandemic.\nCovid cancellations tell part of the story when it comes to savings - for example, Sue Barker and John McEnroe didn't cover Wimbledon after the event was pulled last year.\nMr Davie said there had been \"quite a lot\" of \"little reductions\" because most major sporting, cultural and political events did not take place last year - but that most pay cuts were \"structural\".\nSince 2017, the BBC has been made to publish the names of those earning more than \u00a3150,000 each year, a move instigated by the government, and Lineker has topped the list on each occasion.\nHowever, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend.\nNorton's TV chat show, for instance, does not appear on the report for that reason.\nClaudia Winkelman also disappears from the list, as Strictly Come Dancing isn't counted either. She replaced Norton on Saturday mornings on Radio 2 in February, so that will be reflected in next year's list.\nThe number of senior leaders at the BBC is down from 253 to 241, the report also says.\nThis annual report covers an exceptional year. Despite the usual supply of controversy, from the Proms to Lord Dyson's report on the Princess Diana interview, there are deep trends within this pandemic year which show the BBC to be pursuing a clear strategy under its new leadership. \nFirst, reach: 6.1bn streams on iPlayer represents 28% growth, an extraordinary performance. Average time spent with the BBC each also grew. In the current global market, that is remarkable. \nSecond, leanness: Tim Davie, director general since September, is a commercial creature, and wants efficiency. This has caused ructions and even distress within the BBC, with many staff leaving or having to re-apply for jobs. But it has also led to big reductions in overall public sector staff, and also the wage bill for on-air stars.\nFinally, education, the third pillar of the BBC's Reithian mission to \"inform, educate, and entertain\", has renewed its centrality to the corporation. Consumption of educational programming has soared, fortifying the connection between the BBC and young Britons.\nWill they pay for a licence fee? They might not, which means the pressure on the BBC's commercial arm, which has ambitious targets, will grow. But ahead of negotiations with the government next year, Davie and Richard Sharp, the chairman since February, can point to clear evidence of continued high demand for what the BBC does.\nMr Knight called for the BBC to \"commit to full transparency on its talent bill and drop the smoke and mirrors approach\" following the publication of the report.\n\"There remains a concerning lack of transparency because a number of top-earning stars are paid through BBC Studios and their salaries don't appear here.\"\nHowever, in an earlier press briefing, Mr Davie said it was \"absolutely appropriate\" that the broadcaster did not reveal BBC Studios pay and that he would \"defend robustly\" the current system.\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp pointed to the corporation's work during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying: \"During a profound trauma for the nation, almost overnight we reconfigured all the BBC's output around the most urgent needs of the country. The speed and the agility of the response was exceptional, and they continue to demonstrate very clearly the enduring importance of the BBC is core mission to inform, educate and entertain.\"\nHe warned about \"super inflation\" in production with competition from global giants, saying: \"The cost of some of our biggest series have more than doubled.\n\"Yet despite these pressures, the BBC has proved itself to be resilient and relevant and competitive.\"\nNine out of 10 adults use the BBC every week, and they spend an average of 18 hours and two minutes watching, listening or reading - up from 17 hours 45 minutes last year.\nHowever, those figures fall markedly for younger audiences. Overall, 80% of people aged between 16 and 34 used the BBC every week, falling to 77% for under-16s.\nAmong the 16-34 age group, 51% watched BBC TV every week and 47% listened to BBC radio.\nThe BBC's total workforce has reduced by over 1,200 - that's a 6% decrease.\nBBC Studios - the corporation's commercial arm - suffered a drop in sales of 10% and profits were down 17%, although those figures were due to production pauses and constraints during the pandemic.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Florida,Miami building collapse,Miami,United States",
      "text": "Rescue workers have now recovered all but one of the victims of the tower block that collapsed in Surfside, Florida, on 24 June. Ninety-seven people have been confirmed dead and only Estelle Hedaya is yet to be identified. \nThe search for victims was extremely slow, as rescuers had to sort through the rubble in sweltering heat and high humidity. \nHere is what we know about the victims.\nAntonio Lozano, 83, and his wife Gladys, 79, were among the first to be confirmed dead after their son Sergio Lozano gave officials a DNA sample. \nThey were about to celebrate their 59th wedding anniversary in July and had known each other for more than 60 years. \nThe couple used to joke that neither wanted the other one to die first, because they did not want to be apart from each other. \nMr Lozano could see his parents' apartment from his own home and heard the crash of the collapse. When he ran to the window, he could no longer see their apartment. \nHe told reporters that he took some comfort in the knowledge that they \"went together and went quickly\".\nThe Guara family - dad Marcus, 52, mum Anaely Rodriguez, 42, and daughters Lucia and Emma, 11 and four respectively - lived on the eighth floor. On Tuesday, 6 July, they were among the first of the victims to be buried.\nMr Guara - whose remains were found days before those of his family - was described as \"helpful and friendly\" by college friend Mike Spring, while cousin Peter Milian told the Miami Herald he was \"a great brother, uncle, cousin, son, and loved his daughters passionately\".\n\"A family's been erased,\" Mr Milian told NBC 6 after rescuers found the bodies of Anaely Rodriguez and her daughters.\nManuel LaFont, 54, lived on the eighth floor of the building.\nMr LaFont's two children, a 10-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, had been spending time with him that day, but were picked up by their mother - Mr LaFont's ex-wife - just hours before the collapse.\n\"My children were born again, and I was born again as well,\" she said.\nMr LaFont would often be found playing baseball with his young son, the Miami Herald reports. \nStella Cattarossi, the seven-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter, was inside the building with her mother, grandparents and aunt when it collapsed. Her body was identified on 2 July.\nHer mother, Graciela Cattarossi, 48, and her grandparents Graciela, 86, and Gino Cattarossi, 89, were also killed.\nHer aunt, Andrea, who was visiting from Argentina, has also been confirmed dead. \nStella's father has been working with the rescue efforts and was on scene when she was found, local media report. \nThe first victim to be officially named was Stacie Fang. She was the mother of Jonah Handler, a 15-year-old who was pulled from the rubble hours after the collapse, as he begged rescuers: \"Please don't leave me.\"\nIn a statement, her family expressed thanks for the outpouring of sympathy and support they had received. \"There are no words to describe the tragic loss of our beloved Stacie,\" it read.\nHilda Noriega, 92, was the oldest victim of the tragedy.\nHer grandson Michael described Ms Noriega as \"larger than life\" and \"92 years old going on 62\". \nIn the hours after the collapse, Mr Noriega rushed to the scene with his parents. They later told US media how they found a birthday card and family photographs in the rubble. \nThe family released a statement in which they said they had lost the \"heart and soul\" and \"matriarch\" of the family but would \"get through this time by embracing the unconditional love Hilda was known for\".\nBhavna Patel, a 38-year-old British and US citizen, and her husband Vishal Patel, 42, were both confirmed dead on 2 July. The body of their one-year-old daughter, Aishani was identified the following week. She was the youngest victim.\nBhavna was pregnant, a tweet from a relative said. \nUmma Kannayan is a family friend of the Patels. She told the BBC's Will Grant that they were a \"very loving\" family who were closely involved in their religious community. \n\"Aishani was like the little baby of the temple,\" she said. \"It feels like you've lost a part of yourself.\"\nThe sister of Paraguay's first lady, Silvana L\u00f3pez Moreira, was confirmed dead on 8 July. \nThe remains of Sophia L\u00f3pez Moreira, her husband Luis Pettengill and their three children - ages 3, 6 and 9 - have all been found.\nThe first lady travelled to Florida to be with her family amid the search. \nTheir nanny, Leidy Luna Villalba, was found on 7 July. She had arrived in Miami hours before the building collapsed. It was her first time travelling outside of Paraguay. \nShe sent a message to her cousin when she arrived, telling him she was excited to explore the city. \nHer mother, Juana de Villalba, told media in Paraguay: \"She's the primary breadwinner of our family and she went to Miami for work. She went for us. My heart is broken\".\nHarry Rosenberg, 52, who was confirmed dead on 8 July, relocated to Miami from New York following the loss of his wife, Anna, to cancer and both of his parents to Covid in the past year.\nHe recently told a fellow congregant at a local synagogue he was entering the \"next chapter\" of his life.  \nA close friend told Associated Press that Harry had spent three years taking care of his ill wife.\nHe had only recently bought a second-floor unit in Surfside - big enough to welcome friends and family.\nBrad Cohen, 51, is one of several members of the Jewish community to have died. \nHis brother Gary, 58, who was visiting from Birmingham, Alabama, also lost his life. He had come to Florida so that the pair could see their father, who is ill, in nearby Boynton Beach.\n\"The hardest thing has been seeing the devastation of my 12-year-old daughter, she is very close to her father,\" Brad's wife, Soraya Cohen, told the BBC.\nThe disappearance of one Jewish couple prompted an emotional reaction on social media.\nSeveral people queried the whereabouts of Myriam Caspi Notkin and Arnie Notkin, an elderly couple who lived on the third floor of the collapsed building, but their bodies were both recovered on 9 July.\nThey married about 20 years ago after both being widowed. \nSpeaking to the Miami Herald newspaper, Fortuna Smukler said Mr Notkin was a beloved member of the community. \nMs Smukler said Mr Notkin taught physical education at a local primary school in South Beach for years, and is remembered by many students.\n\"He was such a well-liked PE teacher from people's past,\" she said.\n\"He had students who became famous, and he had to tell me about them, how they were good or mischievous,\" she added.\nMagaly Ramsey received a call from her mother, Magaly Delgado, the night before the collapse.\n\"My mother called me at around 10 o'clock on Wednesday night, but I was at a conference and I couldn't answer her,\" Ms Ramsey told the BBC.\nI'll call her tomorrow, she thought. On 1 July, Miami-Dade police announced they had recovered Magaly's remains. \nMagaly said her mother, an 80-year-old of Cuban origin, was idolised by her two grandsons. \"My kids adored her,\" she told ABC News.\nShe added that her mother had been concerned about shaking from nearby construction work. \n\"She did complain of a lot of tremors and things... she sometimes was concerned about what may be happening to her building,\" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \nKevin Spiegel was on a business trip in California when he heard about the collapse. He and his wife Judy, 66, had lived in an apartment on the sixth floor for more than four years.\nMrs Spiegel's daughter, Rachel, was last in contact with her mother the night before, the New York Times reported.\nThe newspaper said Judy had texted her to say that she had finally found the Disney dress that her four-year-old granddaughter wanted.\nA devoted grandmother, Judy had been helping with picking up the children from school, Rachel said. \n\"My mum is just the best person in the world. She is so caring and loving,\" Rachel told CNN. \nAlfredo Leone, 48; and his son Lorenzo, 5, were among those found nearly three weeks after the tragedy.\nThe boy's mother, Raquel, had been visiting her mother in Colorado at the time of the collapse. \nFamily members have been paying tribute to Estelle Hedaya, 54, the only victim who remains unidentified.\nHer brother Ikey told CBS he took comfort in the fact that she was \"the apex at everything in her life\".\nHe said he was not bothered by her being the last person unaccounted for because it meant that God had chosen her, although he admitted the wait had been very tough on their parents.\n\"I know my sister is in the right place now,\" he said."

      "title": "Covid-19: PM defends Covid easing plans and fans head to Wembley",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nBoris Johnson has faced two grillings today - at Prime Minister's Questions and by senior MPs on the Liaison Committee - about his plans to lift Covid restrictions. Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour party, says it is reckless to go ahead with easing rules on 19 July, as is planned, because the link between infections and deaths has been weakened instead of broken, as the PM claims. \nBut the prime minister says the government's approach is \"balanced and reasonable\" and the vaccination rollout success means he can press ahead. At the committee hearing, he added that vaccines have been the \"great liberator\" and that many more will have had their jabs by 16 August, the date when fully-vaccinated people will no longer have to self-isolate if they come into contact with a positive case. He recognises it is \"frustrating\" people still have to isolate before that point, but notes coronavirus is still hugely contagious. \nThat delay to ending quarantine for vaccinated close contacts of people with Covid could lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate over the summer, ministers are being warned. The knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS, could be huge, industry groups say. From 16 August, those in England who have been fully vaccinated will not have to isolate if a close contact tests positive for coronavirus. But BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could still be asked to self-isolate between now and then. \nIndustry group UK Hospitality says the system is already causing \"carnage\". Chief executive Kate Nicholls says the plans do not go \"far enough, quickly enough\". NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, says the rules are causing disruption in the health service too.\nThe \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit is going to be phased out in the autumn, the government has confirmed. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the boost - introduced in April last year to help deal with the economic effects of Covid - would face an \"adjustment\". But some former work and pensions secretaries have urged ministers not to end the uplift. Universal credit is claimed by more than 5.5 million households in the UK. It was introduced to replace six benefits and merge them into one benefit payment for working-age people. The top up was extended by six months in March and Labour has called for it to continue beyond the autumn. But Boris Johnson says the government's focus is now on getting people into work. \nHouse prices dipped 0.5% last month as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out, lender the Halifax says. The government had removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic to boost the property market. The Halifax said it was important \"to put such a moderate decrease in context\" though. \nWembley is hosting more than 60,000 fans for England's Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark. The crowd capacity at the London venue has been raised for the semi-finals and Sunday's final - meaning it is at 75% capacity on Wednesday evening, with the majority being England fans. This is expected to be the biggest live crowd at a sporting event since the start of the pandemic. You can follow live here. And here's a look in pictures at how fans were preparing to cheer on their team. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nHere's a guide to safely watching the Euro 2020 semi-final tonight. \nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The delay to ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid could lead to millions being asked to self-isolate this summer. \nThe knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS, could be huge, ministers are being warned.\nThe government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England.\nBut BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could still be asked to self-isolate between now and then. \nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of \"ignoring the next big problem that's heading down the track\" as he said \"millions\" would have to self-isolate as cases rose.\n\"It won't feel like freedom day to those who have to isolate, when they're having to cancel their holidays, when they can't go to the pub or even to their kid's sports day,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said the country was \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\".\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said the system was already causing \"carnage\". And chief executive Kate Nicholls added the government's plans did not go \"far enough, quickly enough\".\nHospital bosses have also expressed concern.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said: \"Trust leaders know self-isolation requirements are an ongoing source of frustration for some staff, particularly amongst those who have had both vaccinations, tested negative and want to support their colleagues at a time when there is very high pressure on staffing levels. \n\"There is a major risk that this situation will become more challenging after 19 July when all remaining restrictions are lifted, with the expectation that even more NHS staff will have to self-isolate as community infections rates spike. This is a real current cause of concern amongst trust leaders.\"\nA conservative guess is that we might see 1.5 million cases in the four weeks after 19 July - that would be just over 50,000 cases a day on average. \nAbout three close contacts have been identified for every Covid case reported, according to Test and Trace figures for England in the last month.\nSo, 1.5 million cases, each with about three contacts, gives us between four and five million contacts who might be asked to isolate between 19 July and 16 August.\nAnd, once restrictions are lifted on 19 July and society opens up further, we might expect to see the numbers of contacts to rise.      \nThis is a very rough calculation. The true figures could, of course, be lower or even higher. \nBut it's looking increasingly clear that millions of people will be close contacts of people with coronavirus and legally required to self-isolate in the weeks before England changes the rules.\nSo why are we doing it? Clearly there is a risk scrapping the self-isolation policy would push up the infection rate.\nThe hope is in another month the rise in cases will have peaked and the change would not be as risky.\nEngland is seeing close to 25,000 cases a day on average with cases doubling every 10 days.\nAnd with the remaining restrictions - such as social distancing, limits on the gatherings and the need to wear masks - set to be lifted on 19 July, ministers have warned the public they need to be braced for very high infection levels.\nOn Tuesday Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned there could be as many as 100,000 cases a day.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has conceded the plan to keep self-isolation requirements in place after the end of other restrictions in England was \"not a perfect solution\".\nHe added: \"You can't have it both ways. On the one hand we're saying we want to reopen but we're giving a measure of precaution in terms of delaying the lifting of self-isolation restrictions.\n\"It's a balance, it's not a perfect solution.\"\nUnder-18s, who are not currently entitled to the vaccine, will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are close contacts of a confirmed Covid case in England. \nOther parts of the UK are also seeing rising rates, which will mean many people will be asked to self-isolate. But those nations have not announced what they plan to do about self-isolation as they open up.\nSelf-isolation for people who have symptoms will still be required in England.\nIt is defined by the government as a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for Covid.\nIt can be anyone who:\nYou can be deemed a contact any time from two days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms - or, if they did not have any symptoms, from two days before the date their positive test was taken."

      "text": "Growing up in Iran, Fatemeh Khishvand dreamed of becoming famous, posting selfies on Instagram in the hope of getting noticed.\nTypical enough - only Ms Khishvand's selfies were anything but.\nThey were heavily doctored photos in which her face appeared gaunt, distorted, and enhanced by make-up. \nPosted under a pseudonym, Sahar Tabar, the photos were so striking they attracted international media attention when they first appeared in 2017.\nIn some, Ms Khishvand bore an uncanny resemblance to American actress Angelina Jolie. This led to false rumours that the teen had undergone 50 cosmetic surgeries to look like the Hollywood star but, as she would later clarify, the Corpse Bride character from Tim Burton's titular musical fantasy was her true inspiration.\nSoon, her alter ego had almost 500,000 followers on Instagram, earning her the fame she had always desired.\nBut that fame came at a price.\nIn Iran, it can be dangerous to post on social media. The country's Shia Muslim authorities enforce strict laws about what can and cannot be posted. To them, Ms Khishvand's photos were seen as crimes, not the clever Photoshop trickery of a teenage girl.\nSo, in October 2019, Ms Khishvand was arrested on a raft of charges, including blasphemy, instigating violence, insulting the Islamic dress code and encouraging corruption among young people.\nHer Instagram account was deleted and for more than a year she languished in jail, detained without bail. Eventually an Islamic Revolutionary Court - known for their secrecy and politically motivated rulings against dissidents - delivered a sentence of 10 years in prison in December last year.\nThe severity of the punishment was met with shock and condemnation.\n\"The Islamic Republic has a history of arresting women for dancing, for singing, for removing their compulsory veiling, for entering a stadium, for modelling, but come on - this time, for just using Photoshop,\" Masih Alinejad, a prominent Iranian journalist and activist, said in a Twitter video.\nAs Ms Alinejad's reaction suggested, Ms Khishvand's case is considered a new extreme in Iran's draconian treatment of social media users.\nPrecise data on internet crimes in Iran is hard to come by. But, according to research by the US-based Human Rights Activists in Iran group, at least 332 people have been arrested for their internet activities since 20 December 2016. Of those, 109 were for activities on Instagram, the group said.\nAs the only major social media network not blocked by the government, Instagram is a popular platform for young Iranians to express themselves.\nThis has created a dilemma for the government, which experts say is loath to block the tool for fear of provoking unrest, hampering business owners who rely on it for advertising, and severing a useful means of communication with its citizens. Instead, the government has attempted to act as a moderator.\n\"For so long, Iran has tried to police culture unsuccessfully,\" Tara Sepehri Far, an Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), told the BBC.\n\"There have been several waves of Instagram influencers being called in and interrogated.\"\nOne wave included six Iranians who, in 2014, were given suspended jail sentences and lashes for appearing in a video dancing to Pharrell Williams's song Happy. Another came in 2018, when a teenage gymnast was arrested for posting videos of herself dancing to pop music.\nEach followed a similar pattern. Instagram personalities were harassed, arrested and prosecuted by Iranian authorities, which activists say pressured them to \"confess\" their alleged crimes, sometimes on state TV.\nIndeed, that's apparently what happened to Ms Khishvand, who was paraded on Iranian Channel Two (IRTV2) as \"zombie Angelina Jolie\" a few weeks after her arrest.\nSeyed Ahmad Moinshirazi, 42, says he and his wife Shabnam Shahrokhi, 38, are familiar with the repressive methods of Iranian authorities. They too were popular social media influencers whose Instagram accounts fell foul of the law.\nMr Moinshirazi said that, from 2018, he was subjected to a campaign of intimidation by Iran's Cyber Police, which summoned him for questioning and demanded a signed pledge of co-operation.\nDuring one hours-long interrogation, Mr Moinshirazi said he was repeatedly threatened with baseless espionage charges and ordered to purge his account of certain posts, such as those that showed his wife without a mandatory headscarf, known as a hijab.\n\"They said these posts had contaminated Iran with Western culture,\" Mr Moinshirazi, a retired kickboxer better known as Picasso Moin, told the BBC.\nThe posts were removed as requested, yet the harassment continued, culminating in the couple's arrest and release on bail of $200,000 (\u00a3147,000; 164,500 euros) in 2019.\n\"Our lawyer said they definitely want to see some blood,\" father-of-two Mr Moinshirazi said.\nA lengthy jail term seemed certain. So, fearing for the lives of his young children, Mr Moinshirazi and his family fled to Turkey in September 2019.\nProsecutors were furious, Mr Moinshirazi said. No wonder, then, that the couple were sentenced harshly in absentia, receiving 16 years in prison, 74 lashes and a fine between them.\nMr Moinshirazi believes the Iranian government wanted to make an example of him, like they did to Ms Khishvand.\n\"This is how Iran works,\" he said. \"In order to distract from other things in the country, they find cases to push their agendas. And Sahar Tabar is one of them.\"\nTellingly, Ms Khishvand revealed her sentence in an interview with Rokna, a private news agency thought to have close ties with the Iranian government. In the interview, she said she had been convicted of two of the four charges against her, but hoped to be pardoned.\nMeanwhile, more lurid articles appeared on Rokna. Written in a gossipy, stigmatising tone, the articles portrayed Ms Khishvand as the troubled child of a divorced couple, a loner whose desperation for Instagram fame was indicative of poor education, immorality, and mental illness.\nA mental health condition that Ms Khishvand said she had in the interview was a prominent feature of Rokna's coverage. Prosecutors, Ms Sepehri Far said, have a habit of promoting \"their own version of the story, their propaganda\" through the media.\n\"In the case of Sahar, they brought her before the camera to talk about the history of her mental health and her troubled family life,\" Ms Sepehri Far said. \"They're promoting this narrative of, if you're taking things to that extreme, you have a troubled family.\"\nFor now, Ms Khishvand has been shown some mercy. At the end of December 2020, she was granted bail while she appeals her sentence.\n\"This is a small reward for her TV admission under duress, dismissing the lawyers and obeying their plans,\" her former lawyer Saeid Dehghan said.\nAs for the appeal, much depends on the mood of prosecutors who did not differentiate between Ms Khishvand and the cartoonish persona she invented.\n\"In the end, she remains simply a teenager who is being cruelly and publicly punished and humiliated for daring to express herself outside the bounds of Iran's arbitrary rules governing personal social media use,\" Jasmin Ramsey, communications director for the Center for Human Rights in Iran, told the BBC.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Persian journalist Soroush Pakzad."

      "text": "Customers are fed up with being told they are getting poor service \"because of Covid\", according to research.  \nFirms are being accused of using the pandemic as an excuse for long waits on the telephone or late deliveries, the UK Institute of Customer Service said.\nIt said that consumers were initially tolerant of delays and other issues as businesses fought to cope with the effects of the crisis.\nBut it said a blanket excuse was no longer sufficient.\nThe number of complaints about poor service in the last six months was at its highest level since 2009, according to the institute's survey of 10,000 people.\nThe sectors with the biggest issues were transport, local public services - such as GP surgeries, councils and police services, and telecommunications, the survey suggested.\nA quarter of those asked said that some organisations had used Covid as an excuse for poor service.\n\"Saying 'because of Covid' is not a good phrase,\" said Jo Causon, the institute's chief executive. \"Organisations must not hide behind this blanket statement.\"\nShe said that many businesses had responded admirably to the difficulties created by the pandemic. She said that managed queuing systems, such as inviting people to call at quieter times, was one area of success.\nOthers had gone out of their way to assist people during the crisis, she said. Delays in deliveries had also arisen owing to the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March, and border issues as a result of Brexit.\nRetailers needed to be honest with customers when they started looking at a particular product about any potential delays, she said, so they were aware of how long they might have to wait to inform their decision about what to buy.\nOne energy customer was surprised to see that his new smart meter suggested he was using \u00a345,000 worth of gas an hour.\nThe 50-year-old from Gloucestershire said the meter displayed the extreme gas usage a day after it was fitted.\nWhile the meter was clearly not working properly, the customer said he was more frustrated that his energy company had not offered an explanation, nor sent him any kind of bill for four months.\nThe problems occurred during lockdown. Covid was not used as an excuse, but he found that it seemed almost impossible to get an answer from anyone at the energy firm.\n\"There has been no resolution. I would like to know what I owe,\" he said.\nCitizens Advice has said many gas and electricity customers are still being plagued by inaccurate bills.\nThe Institute of Customer Service said companies should provide \"honest, genuine communication at all stages\" to customers.\nMs Causon said that satisfaction levels has risen slightly as firms had ultimately dealt with issues, but she said businesses needed to work on preventing the complaints in the first place.\nMany customers were willing to pay extra, she said, if they knew they would get better customer service.\nBank First Direct, department store John Lewis, online retailer Amazon, and bike and vehicle company Suzuki topped the institute's table for customer satisfaction.  \nThe first three of these were the only brands in the top 10 which featured in the same survey a year ago."

I can't wait to go to see these amazing musicians on stage again!\"\nThe announcement comes two days after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he expected to lift the remaining lockdown restrictions in England on 19 July - meaning the end to capacity limits on gigs, and the reopening of nightclubs.\nHowever, more than half of this summer's festivals have already been cancelled - with major events like Glastonbury and BST Hyde Park postponing until next year.\nAccording to the Music Venue Trust, 83% of concert halls have faced closure over the last year. In a survey, its members suggested they would emerge from lockdown with a collective debt of \u00a345 million.\nThe government says it has helped support more than 800 music organisations with grants from its Culture Recovery Fund over the last year. \nTrade paper Music Week has also suggested the government is likely announce an insurance scheme for the summer's remaining festivals in the coming week.\nEvent organisers and venue owners have been calling for such a scheme since the start of the year, saying it is the only way they can plan events without the fear of going bankrupt if a new wave of infections forces them to cancel.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Lord Elystan-Morgan, who campaigned for a Welsh parliament within two different parties, decades before it came to fruition, has died at the age of 88.\nA significant figure in the country's politics, the former Labour MP led the campaign for devolution in 1979.\nBorn in Pen-y-garn in 1932, his legal work saw him defend two men who tried to stop the Tryweryn valley flooding. \nHe died peacefully in his sleep with his family at his side on Wednesday morning.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said his \"tireless work laid the foundations for the Senedd we have today\".\n\"He had one of the greatest reaches in Welsh political life with a range that goes back to his election in the 1960s,\" he said.\n\"He had an enormous breadth of understanding of issues faced by Wales, especially rural Welsh-speaking communities, which he represented.\"\nFormer Welsh secretary and attorney general Lord Morris of Aberavon described how he had \"lost my greatest friend from my schooldays\".\n\"He was a Cardi, and a great Welshman,\" the former Aberavon MP and barrister said.\n\"We were on holiday together as two families in Cornwall, when he came up from the beach at lunchtime, with the idea that was completely new to me at the time, for the government to establish a royal commission on the constitution.\n\"We had both agreed for years that only a Labour government could legislate for Wales to be governed from Cardiff.\n\"The dream was finally realised, following a turbulous journey in 1979.\"\nLord Morris said the death of his friend was \"a great loss, a Welshman who kept the faith, and I feel the loss deeply today.\"\nFormer Plaid Cymru president Lord Wigley said without the campaign for devolution in the 1970s the Welsh Parliament would not have happened.\nBen Lake, Plaid MP for Ceredigion, said he was \"a rare figure in the political world: a statesman of intellect and integrity\".\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies also paid tribute to a \"champion for Cardigan and rural Wales\".\nElystan Morgan was the MP for Cardiganshire for eight years, before he joined the House of Lords as Lord Elystan-Morgan in 1981.\nHe had studied law in Aberystwyth before working as a solicitor in Wrexham for a decade. \nHe later became a barrister and a judge, and served as president of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth between 1997 and 2007.\nHis involvement in politics began in Plaid Cymru, with which he stood as a parliamentary candidate in the Wrexham by-election in 1955, and again in the general election which followed two months later. \nHe stood there for the third time in the 1959 general election.\nAs a solicitor, he defended David Walters and David Pritchard, who had tried to stop the flooding of the Tryweryn valley to create a reservoir by damaging equipment on the site. They were fined \u00a350 each. \nHe stood as a Plaid Cymru candidate in Meirionnydd in 1964. \nDafydd Wigley said Elystan Morgan was \"a very prominent figure in Plaid Cymru in the middle of the last century, and Gwynfor Evans saw him as his successor. But things didn't work out and Elystan joined the Labour Party.\"\nIn a memoir published in 2012, Elystan Morgan said he had joined Plaid Cymru saying he thought it could win \"the sort of majority support in Wales that forced the government of the day... to allow a parliament for the nation.\n\"By the middle of the '60s it seemed totally obvious that this wouldn't happen in our days.\"\n\"It was within Labour therefore that the greatest work was to be done,\" he went on to say.\nHe left Plaid Cymru in August 1965 \"feeling wholeheartedly that my political home would be within the Labour Party from then on\".\nUnexpectedly for him, he was elected Labour MP for Cardiganshire - now known as Ceredigion - in the 1966 general election. He held on to the seat in 1970.\nHis time in the Commons saw him chair the Parliamentary Labour Party and serve on the Labour front bench, both as a minister in the Home Office and later as an opposition spokesman.\nLord Wigley said his big contribution in the late 1960s \"was to persuade Jim Callaghan to have a commission on devolution, the Crowther Commission that became the Kilbrandon Commission\".\n\"Their report in 1973 was a backdrop to the new Labour government that came in 1974, and the campaign throughout the '70s to secure assemblies for Scotland and Wales.\"\nThe Cardiganshire seat turned Liberal in the election of February 1974, and he tried unsuccessfully to win it back in the second general election of that year. \nThe first referendum on whether Wales should have its own assembly took place on 1 March 1979.\nLord Elystan-Morgan was president of the yes campaign that year, and promoted the cause in many public meetings.\nBut the campaign was defeated by a majority of four to one. \"St David's Day brought its cruel dawn,\" was how he reflected on it.\nFollowing the campaign Elystan Morgan failed to be elected MP for Anglesey in the 1979 general election. \nBut Lord Wigley said without the campaigns for assemblies in Wales and Scotland at the time \"we wouldn't have secured what we did in the '90s and we wouldn't be now with the parliament for Wales and Scotland\".\nAfter Elystan Morgan lost his parliamentary seat, he started working as a barrister in chambers in Cardiff. \nHe was elevated to the House of Lords in 1981. \nHe was a member of the Labour front bench and concentrated on legal and constitutional matters until he became a judge in 1987. \n\"For the next 19 years, politics was exiled completely from my life until I retired from the bench in 2005\", he said.\nHe returned to the House of Lords in 2005 and as a former judge, he sat there as a crossbencher.\nThere, he paid particular attention to the 2006 Government of Wales Act, which paved the way for a referendum to provide more law making powers for the then National Assembly.\nSpeaking about his contribution to that debate he said: \"If I had done nothing else in my life but that, I would say that it justified what I did [leaving Plaid Cymru and joining Labour]\".\nHe retired from the Lords in February 2020."

      "text": "The Scottish government has not yet decided whether to follow England in changing the self-isolation rules for school pupils and people who have been double vaccinated. \nScotland's education secretary said the government was \"looking very seriously\" at whether it can make changes.\nShirley-Anne Somerville said decisions would be taken \"as soon as we can\".\nBut she said any decision would be based on the clinical advice and guidance the government is given.\nThe UK government announced on Tuesday that fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August.\nThe same policy will also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date, while the system of \"bubbles\" in schools that sees pupils being sent home after a positive case will also be axed.\nThere have been calls for the Scottish government to introduce similar changes north of the border, where thousands of pupils have missed out on learning due to having to self-isolate. \nMs Somerville told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the absence rates in Scottish schools was about 4% at the end of the school term.\nBut only 3% of those actually had Covid - with the vast majority of absent pupils only being off school because they had to self-isolate after someone else tested positive. \nMeanwhile, researchers from the London School of Economics and the University of Exeter have found that pupils in Scotland lost out on an average of 64 days of learning time during the pandemic - about a third of the school year.\nThey also concluded that the poorest pupils suffered larger learning losses than their richer peers.\nMs Somerville said this was why the government was \"looking very seriously about whether we can make to changes to the self-isolation measures that are in place for children and young people as we move into the next academic year\".\nShe said following England in scrapping school bubbles was \"certainly one option\" that was being explored by the Covid Education Recovery Group.\nBut she added: \"I think people would expect us to go through that due process to make sure that parents, young people and staff have the confidence that the guidance we are putting together is fit for purpose, and that we've worked through that process together.\"\nMs Somerville also said potentially having different isolation rules for fully vaccinated people was being \"actively reviewed\" as a potential way of easing staffing pressures in hospitals, schools and other public services.\nRaigmore Hospital in Inverness was placed on \"code black\" status earlier this week after reaching capacity amid increasing Covid cases, with the local health board saying the pressure was partly due to large numbers of staff having to self-isolate.\nHowever, Ms Somerville stressed that the government also had a duty to protect those who have not had both doses.\nShe said: \"This is something that would benefit different parts of the population, different sectors of the economy. \n\"But again we must look at the evidence, we must look to see whether that's the right thing to do at this point of the virus because the virus is very much still here.\"\nMeanwhile, all travel restrictions between Scotland and the north west of England are to be lifted, with the ban on non-essential trips to Blackburn with Darwen to expire at midnight.\nAnd Scotland's health secretary has defended taking a family holiday to the Harry Potter studios near London during Scotland's surge in Covid cases.\nHumza Yousaf said he would not apologise for spending time with his family as they have seen very little of him over the last seven months.\nDetails of the trip were revealed by the Scottish Sun newspaper. \nScottish Conservative chief whip Stephen Kerr questioned whether it was appropriate for the health secretary to \"disappear\" while Scotland continues to have some of the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nMr Kerr said: \"People are continuing to make huge sacrifices to ensure we can return to normality and that will include missing out on holidays.\""

      "text": "Covid rules that have seen hundreds of thousands of pupils miss out on learning due to self-isolation are being axed in England, it is confirmed.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the system of sending \"bubbles\" of children home after a positive case would cease at the end of summer term.  \nThe bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he said.\nTeaching unions warned against easing rules as cases are still rising.\nThe changes to schools guidance will take effect at the same time as the country eases restrictions and moves to stage four. This is expected to be on 19 July - with confirmation of this due next Monday. \nHowever, some schools break up a few days before that.\nThe need for face masks, social distancing measures and staggered start and finish times in schools will be scrapped from September, Mr Williamson said.\nThe Covid testing regime for pupils will be transferred to the NHS track and trace system, Mr Williamson said.\nInstead, secondary schools will be asked to offer pupils two Covid tests at the beginning of the autumn term, as a one-off event.\nThe changes were announced as the latest official statistics for England show the number of pupils out and self-isolating due to Covid hit a record high of 641,000 pupils.  \nOnly 28,000 of these had a confirmed case of Covid-19. \nMr Williamson told the Commons: \"Keeping children in consistent groups was essential to control the spread of the virus when our population was less vaccinated.\n\"We recognise that the system of bubbles and isolation is causing disruption to many children's education. \n\"That is why we'll be ending bubbles and transferring contact tracing to the NHS Test and Trace system for early years settings, schools and colleges.\"\nDepartment for Education figures show that in the autumn term (2020), some 33 million days of school were missed by pupils observing Covid isolation rules.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced that from 16 August under 18s would not have to isolate unless they themselves had tested positive for Covid. \nThis will prevent large numbers of youngsters having to stay at home because they have been in contact with someone who has the virus.\nMr Williamson said: \"I do not think it is acceptable that children should face greater restrictions over and above those of wider society, especially since they have given up so much to keep older generations safe during this pandemic.\"\nHe said: \"Where there are outbreaks schools and colleges may be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and they will also work with local health teams as they currently do now.\n\"We're also setting out new rules that mean from the 16 August children will only need to isolate if they have tested positive for Covid-19.\"\nAlice is a student at Westhoughton High School in Bolton, one of the areas of the country most significantly impacted by Covid. \nShe has had to self-isolate three times this school year and says it has been very difficult to study at home.\n\"I'm really lucky because my mum's a teacher so she's been able to help me on some things, but I've been struggling on how to do the difficult work in isolation,\" says Alice.\n\"It was hard because you're not face-to-face with a teacher - when you're in class teachers can read your facial expressions and tell when you're struggling and they can come and work individually with you.\n\"But when you're at home you're kind of struggling on your own.\"\nAlice has also struggled not seeing her friends.\nShe says being in school is always the best option and makes her feel more confident about her GCSE study. \"I'm not worrying as much,\" she says.\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers, said it was unclear how the changes would prevent disruption from happening.\n\"Removing the requirement for pupils to self-isolate when they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive may well accelerate the spread of the virus in schools and cause even higher levels of disruption for pupils and teachers. \"\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this significant relaxation of measures would be greeted with some trepidation after the past 15 months.\nBut he added that it simply would not be fair to continue with the current controls which have \"blighted the lives of children and young people\", when the adult population was largely vaccinated.\nThe education secretary also said there would be no restrictions on in-person teaching and learning in universities as national restrictions are lifted.\nAnalysis: \nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondent\nThe latest huge increase in pupils being sent home shows the chaos threatening the end of term in England's schools.\nScrapping the bubble system and changing the rules about isolation is intended to reduce the disruption - because as this week's figures show, 96% of those at home because of Covid do not have Covid.\nThis is now about \"managing Covid\" next term rather than expecting it to disappear.\nThere is also another troubling issue revealed by these attendance figures. While more than 641,000 are off school for Covid-related issues there are almost as many again who are absent for other, mostly unexplained, reasons.\nThe non-Covid absence numbers are way higher than would usually be off sick - and it raises questions about whether families are keeping pupils off school or large numbers of children have effectively stopped attending.\nThe reasons, like the risks, are unknown but worrying. But it means more than 1.2 million children are missing from school."

      "text": "A decision not to ease rules on self-isolation until 16 August could lead to severe staff shortages this summer, industry groups have warned.\nFrom next month, double-jabbed people in England will not have to isolate if a close contact tests positive.\nBut with cases rising and most Covid rules set to end on 19 July, there are fears millions of people will still have to take time off work this summer.\nUK Hospitality said self-isolation was already causing \"carnage\" to firms.\nAt the moment, close contacts of people who test positive for Covid have to isolate for up to 10 days.\nBut UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls said testing could replace isolation for people who've been in contact with a Covid patient.\n\"We understand the need for caution and effective transmission control,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\"What we are asking for is pragmatic adjustment to avoid disadvantaging young workers - test to release as per international travel will reduce disruption without reducing protection.\"\nThe Orchard Tea Gardens in Grantchester near Cambridge had to close this week after several staff were contacted by the NHS Test and Trace app. \nOwner Charles Bunker said sales were already down 30% this summer, while ingredient prices and staff wages had risen sharply. The cafe now faced a \"perfect storm\" due to the impact of test and trace.\n\"The reality is that most of these people aren't ill, they've just been in contact with someone who has and have had to self isolate,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money.\n\"We need a system now whereby people can test, and immediately they are found not to have Covid they can come back to work. \n\"16 August will be two thirds of the way through our summer and the hospitality is dependent on having a good summer.\" \nCurrently, if you are required to self isolate your employer cannot force you to come into work, says Emma Bartlett, an employment lawyer at CM Murray.  \nDoing so would not only breach your rights but those of your fellow workers in terms of health and safety.\nAs you isolate you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth \u00a396.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme. \nA \u00a3500 grant is also available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate.\nOn Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected cases to \"rise significantly\" as restrictions were eased and that they could go as high as 100,00 per day.\nAccording to BBC analysis, more than 4.5 million people could still be asked to self-isolate between now and 16 August.\nBut Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the government had to strike a balance between reopening the economy and curbing the spread of Covid-19.\n\"On the one hand we're being told that the restrictions are too onerous, and on the other we're being told that we're being too loose in terms of lifting those restrictions. And that's the balance, that's the nature of political judgment,\" he told Sky News.\nCumbrian climbing centre The Wall only has three staff and if they all had to isolate at the same time the business would have to shut, manager Joe Holden said. \nAll staff are under 25 and none have had the jab, he added.  \n\"It's hard enough to get enough people through the door, let alone keeping up with the rules changing every few weeks,\" he told the BBC. \n\"We'll have to take on more staff as a contingency option [in case we're forced to isolate] but training more people increases the workload and costs for us.\"   \nAnother sector potentially at risk from a rise in self-isolation is beauty. Most businesses in the sector are small and only employ a few staff. They also rely heavily on younger workers. \nLesley Blair, boss of industry group Babtac, said self-isolation was \"incredibly disruptive\" and urged the government to give staff in the industry priority for second vaccinations ahead of 16 August.\n\"Alternatively ideally rules could be changed, subject to certain conditions, such as daily tests being done, to allow businesses to stay open and staff to work provided they tested negative each day.\"\nHowever, Amanda Falls, owner of KH Hair Group in the East Midlands, said she \"welcomed\" the easing of self-isolation rules from August. \nOut of 26 staff across her two salons, 20 have been double jabbed and those that have not are under 20 years old. One fully vaccinated staff member had to self-isolate recently costing her about \u00a32,000 in lost income.\n\"Businesses can't continue like this - if I got tracked and traced I'd be fuming because I'm double jabbed,\" she said. \nDo you run a business?

      "text": "The first funerals have been held for victims of the Florida building collapse, 12 days after the disaster.\nThe Guara family - Marcus, 52, Anaely Rodriguez, 42, and their daughters, Lucia, 11, and Emma, four - are among 46 people now known to have died when Champlain Towers South collapsed on 24 June.\nMore than 90 people are still missing, with 70 confirmed to have been inside.\nRescue efforts are continuing, but no one has been found alive since the first morning.\nThe teams are still carefully sorting through the wreckage of the 12-storey building in Surfside, just north of Miami, even as experts warn the chance of finding survivors is now slim.\nTuesday's funerals took place just a few blocks away at St Joseph's, the Catholic church where the Guaras had worshipped.\nThree coffins were carried into the church. The family decided to bury the sisters together, in a coffin decorated with pink and purple ribbons. They are among the youngest known victims of the collapse.\nThe family had lived on the eighth floor. Marcus Guara - a sales manager who raised money for a number of charities - was found first, two days after the collapse. Anaely Rodriguez and their two girls were found four days later.\nMr Guara's cousin Peter Mili\u00e1n, speaking in the church, said he took comfort from the fact the couple had died with their children.\n\"As ironic as it may sound I truly believe God watched over them by not making them suffer without Lucia and Emma,\" he said.\nAnnette Guara Hurst, Mr Guara's sister, told WSVN in an interview a few days earlier that the family were relieved all four had been found as \"not too many people have had that blessing\".\nSo far, rescuers have removed more than 124 tons (five million pounds) of debris from the site, according to Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan Cominsky. But they had not found any \"liveable spaces\".\n\"Unfortunately, we are not seeing anything positive,\" he told a press conference on Tuesday.\nRescue efforts are now being further slowed by high winds from Storm Elsa, which is approaching from the south.\n\"The wind is hampering the large cranes moving very heavy debris,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burket told reporters.\nMeanwhile, officials are investigating other tower blocks in the area for potential structural faults.\nWhat caused the 40-year-old Champlain Towers South to crumble remains unclear. A 2018 inspection, however, warned of \"major\" flaws in the original design.\nThe building association's board has said it will appoint an \"independent receiver... to oversee the legal and claims process\"."

      "tags": "South Africa,Jacob Zuma",
      "text": "South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has handed himself in to police to begin serving a 15-month jail sentence for contempt of court.\nHe was admitted to Estcourt Correctional Centre in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday.\nPolice had warned that they were prepared to arrest him if he did not hand himself in by midnight.\nZuma, 79, was handed the jail term last week after he failed to attend a corruption inquiry.\nThe sentencing sparked an unprecedented legal drama in South Africa, which has never seen a former president jailed before.\nZuma had initially refused to hand himself in, but in a short statement on Wednesday, the Jacob Zuma Foundation said he had \"decided to comply\".\nHis daughter, Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, later wrote on Twitter that her father was \"en route [to the jail] and he is still in high spirits\".\nZuma was sentenced on 29 June for defying an instruction to give evidence at an inquiry into corruption during his nine years in power. He has testified only once at the inquiry into what has become known as \"state capture\" - meaning the siphoning off of state assets.\nBusinessmen have been accused of conspiring with politicians to influence the decision-making process while he was in office. But Zuma has repeatedly said that he is the victim of a political conspiracy.\nIn a separate legal matter, Zuma pleaded not guilty last month in a corruption trial involving a $5bn (\u00a33bn) arms deal from the 1990s.\nThough he was forced out of office by his own party in 2018, the African National Congress (ANC), he retains a loyal body of supporters, especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.\nOn Sunday, crowds formed what they called a human shield outside Zuma's palatial home in an effort to prevent his arrest. Similar crowds gathered before he handed himself in on Wednesday.\nAnalysis by Farouk Chothia, BBC News\nZuma was once an illustrious political figure, who was jailed for fighting the racist system of apartheid in South Africa. \nNow, he has been arrested for being contemptuous of South Africa's most senior judges - the guardians of the democracy he fought for - as he tried to evade accountability over the deluge of corruption allegations he faced during his presidency.  \nIt is an ignominious end to Zuma's political career, but a proud moment for South Africa's democracy. It shows that no-one is above the law - not even a former president. \nHis supporters threatened to block any attempt by police to arrest him, but in the end they did not have to. The 79-year-old surrendered, knowing he could not defeat the might of the state.\nThe BBC's Nomsa Maseko, who was outside Zuma's home on Wednesday, noted that there was a large police presence outside the property that included armed officers and a paramilitary unit.\nA delegation of senior officers are believed to have spent several hours inside the residence negotiating with the former president over his arrest.\nA convoy of cars, one of which was carrying Zuma, was then seen leaving the house at high-speed shortly before the midnight deadline for his detention.\nZuma previously declared that he was prepared to go to prison. \nHowever, he said that \"sending me to jail during the height of a pandemic, at my age, is the same as sentencing me to death\"."

      "title": "Euros 2020: What all of us can learn from Gareth Southgate",
      "tags": "Diversity",
      "text": "Part of Gareth Southgate's success could be his willingness to turn to football outsiders to help prepare his England team. One of these advisers, former Olympian Matthew Syed, argues there's a lot the rest of the world can learn about this approach.   \nIf there is one universal truth about human psychology, it is that we love being surrounded by people who think just like us. The Ancient Greeks called it \"homophily\" which means \"love of the same\". It was Plato who warned \"birds of a feather flock together\".  \nIn some ways, this is the story of the England football set-up for the last three decades, the squad run by a true \"footballing man\" advised by other \"footballing men\". The idea is that if you get knowledgeable football chaps in a room, you will maximise the amount of knowledge - and thereby find a way to win matches. \nThis is why when Sir Clive Woodward - a world-class rugby coach - was appointed as an assistant coach at Southampton FC a few years ago, there was uproar. \"But he's a rugby person\", football insiders said in horror. \n\"If Harry Redknapp - the coach of Southampton at the time - needs advice, what is wrong with, say, Tony Pulis or David Pleat (both English based football coaches)? They are experts on football!\"\nThe curious thing about these arguments is that they are, on the surface, persuasive. It is true that Pulis knows more about football than Woodward. But do you see the problem? Redknapp already knows what Pulis knows. They were each socialised into the assumptions of English football: a way of setting up tactically, diet, recovery, you name it. They are, if you like, intellectual \"clones\". \nIf you put Redknapp, Pulis and Pleat in a room - all good footballing men - you would have high individual knowledge, but you would also have collective uniformity. You would have an echo chamber. They would reflect each other's assumptions back to each other. It would be comfortable, chummy and consensual. It would also be monolithic and non-creative. \nThis tendency is a problem that extends beyond English football. When the CIA was founded in 1947, it hired brilliant analysts, but they also happened to look similar - white, middle-class, Anglo Saxon, Protestant males. \nThe recruiters, doubtless subconsciously, were influenced by homophily. As the academics Milo Jones and Philippe Silberzahn put it: \"The first consistent attribute of the CIA's identity from 1947 to 2001 is homogeneity in terms of race, sex, ethnicity and class background.\"\nThe same is true of many of the big tech firms such as Google which, a decade or so ago, wondered why innovation had dried up, despite hiring so many brilliant software engineers. \nThey then realised that they were hiring people from similar universities who had learned under similar professors and had absorbed a similar range of concepts, heuristics and models. They were \"clones\" of each other. Only when they started looking beyond their usual horizons, reaching out to different universities and social networks, did things change. \nGareth Southgate, the England head coach, has followed a different approach, opening himself up to new ideas from the outset. \nOne source of these ideas is the FA Technical Advisory Board, an eclectic group that has been advising on performance in regular meetings since 2016.  \nMembers (all unpaid volunteers) include Sir Dave Brailsford, a cycling coach, Colonel Lucy Giles, a college commander at the Sandhurst Military Academy, the Olympic rower Dame Kath Grainger, Manoj Badale, a tech entrepreneur, the rugby coach Stuart Lancaster and David Sheepshanks, mastermind behind the St George's Park national football centre. \nAt first, football insiders were horrified by this group, with negative articles appearing in the British press. We are not \"footballing men\". But this is why the group is capable of offering fresh insights on preparation, diet, data, mental fortitude and more. This is sometimes called \"divergent\" thinking to contrast it with the \"convergence\" of echo chambers. \n\"I like listening to people who know things that I don't,\" Southgate told me. \"That's how you learn.\"\nSouthgate has also assembled a diverse group of coaches in Graeme Jones, Chris Powell and Martyn Margetson - individuals who have deep but very different experiences of the game. And, just as importantly, he's keen to listen to them: the moment England score, the celebration is curtailed so that Southgate can gain the input of Steve Holland, his assistant. \nThese diverse coaches are not rebels in the sense of seeking to disrupt the team. Rather, they are rebels in the sense of injecting fresh thinking which helps everyone perform better. \nThe tragedy is that people in echo chambers often don't even realise they are trapped. This is a point made by the novelist David Foster Wallace, who tells a story that starts in a fish tank. \"There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish, who nods at them and says 'Morning, boys. How's the water?' And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then one of them looks at the other and goes, 'What the hell is water?'\" \nWallace's point is that when we are surrounded by people who think the same way, we can overlook the obvious. Classic examples include Blockbuster, which missed the opportunities of the internet despite dominating the movie rental business, and Kodak, which was so fixated on print photography that it never took the opportunities afforded by digital. \nThe CIA missed an entire series of threats due to its clone-like recruits. A few more rebels could have changed everything. It wasn't until after the 9-11 attack that the CIA started to broaden its intake. \nOf course, diversity shouldn't be pursued frivolously. If Brailsford, Giles, Badale, Grainger et al were advising not on football performance but how to design the Large Hadron Collider, they would be ineffectual. Introducing outsiders for the sake of it rarely works. The key is to bring people together whose perspectives are both relevant to the problem, and which are also different from each other. This maximises both \"depth\" and \"range\" of knowledge - leading to \"collective intelligence\". \nThe England football team haven't won the Euros, and there's a long way to go. But the power of diversity is beyond dispute, central to the strategies of many of the most cutting-edge institutions. \nEcho chambers may be comfortable but they are inherently self-limiting. In the post-pandemic age, with the world changing faster than ever, it is diversity that unlocks the key to success. \nMatthew Syed is author of Rebel Ideas: the Power of Diverse Thinking and represented Great Britain in table tennis at two Olympic Games "

      "text": "The fee charged to Republic of Ireland-born people who live in the UK and want to become British citizens is at worst \"indefensible\", MPs have said.\nThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee said it is unfair for those individuals to have to pay the \u00a31,330 naturalisation charge. \nThe committee said the policy ignored the UK and Ireland's unique relationship. \nA more \"considered and bespoke\" understanding was needed, it added. \nIt also recommended making it simpler for people in Northern Ireland to renounce British citizenship.\nIn its findings, the House of Commons committee said the government must waive the requirement for Irish citizens to pass the Life in the UK test, which costs \u00a350, and make attending the citizenship ceremony optional.\nBoth are currently required - along with the \u00a31,330 naturalisation fee - for an Irish citizen who wants a UK passport.\nThe committee also recommended the government simplify the process of renouncing British citizenship for those who wish to identify only as Irish. \nCurrently, a person must first declare themselves a British citizen before they can renounce it. \nSimon Hoare, Northern Ireland Affairs Committee chairman, said respect for, and acceptance of, people's identities in Northern Ireland was a cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement. \n\"It's clear that the current approach towards citizenship issues from the Home Office has failed to consider the history, personal ties and movement of people between the two countries,\" he said. \n\"As a consequence, the government's universal approach to citizenship leaves some feeling unable to assert properly and simply their identity as either Irish or British or both.\"\nEarlier in the year, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) peer Lord Hay told the committee he had been discriminated against in his attempts to get a British passport. \nThe former Stormont speaker was born in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland but is a long-term Northern Ireland resident. \nHe said that latest census figures show that there were 40,000 people living in Northern Ireland who were born in the Republic. \n\"I welcome the recommendations of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee where they are clearly saying that the fee has got to be dealt with,\" Lord Hay told BBC Radio Foyle on Wednesday.\nHe said the committee had \"clearly said to the Home Office the fee must be dealt with\" and described the naturalisation process as having been \"fraught with insensitivity\".\n\"The key issue is that \u00a31,300 puts a lot of people off in applying for British citizenship and the Home Office have had this issue for some time,\" he added. \n\"It's a real barrier to people who simply want to register as a British citizen.\"\nMr Hoare said the fee was \"absurd and unfair\", adding: \"The policy is out of step with what the public needs, and with life on the island of Ireland today.\"\nIn its evidence to the committee, the Home Office had argued the process was fair, as it was the same for people born in any other third country. \nHowever the committee found such an explanation \"is to fundamentally miss the historical nuance of the issue\". \nThe committee also heard from Emma DeSouza, who took a legal case in 2015 when an application for a residence card for her US-born husband was rejected.\nThe Home Office deemed her British even though she had never held a British passport and had always held an Irish passport.\nThe Good Friday Agreement allows people born in Northern Ireland to identify as British, Irish or both.\nThe committee found there were \"competing views\" between the Irish and UK governments on the meaning and intention of birth right provisions.\nMr Hoare said: \"Even amongst those who are covered by the agreement, there remain inconsistencies in the approaches taken by the co-guarantors in London and Dublin, principally on what the terms 'to identify' and 'be accepted as' actually mean in practice. \n\"A joint UK-Irish approach on this front will help smooth inconsistencies and prevent further grievances.\"\nMrs DeSouza argued the Good Friday Agreement's birth rights provision referred to citizenship, not \"some abstract concept of identity\".\n\"The right to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both has to have meaning in practice. The idea that legislators concerned themselves with providing an individual with a right to feel a certain way is illogical and unsupported,\" she said.\n\"I encourage both governments to take a generous approach to ensuring parity between the people of Northern Ireland.\"\nThe story was corrected on 7 July 2021 to make clear the \u00a31,330 fee is for Irish citizens to naturalise, and not a passport fee."

      "text": "North America experienced its warmest June on record, according to the EU's Earth observation programme.\nThat will come as no surprise given the unprecedentedly high temperatures recently recorded during the heatwave that hit Canada and parts of the US.\nBut UK residents may be startled to learn that despite the rain and cloud they experienced, it was the second warmest June on record for Europe.\nIt was also the fourth warmest June ever recorded worldwide.\nCopernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme, produces its figures for world temperatures from computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, aircraft and weather stations around the world.  \nClimate experts say the findings point to a frightening escalation in temperature extremes.  \n\"We are getting used to record high temperatures being recorded somewhere around the world every year now,\" says Prof Peter Stott of the UK Met Office.  \nHe says what meteorologists like him find shocking is not that the world is experiencing more heatwaves but that temperature records are increasingly being broken by such large margins.\nIn Canada and the north-western US, several cities recorded temperatures a full 5 degrees Celsius above previous records. \nA Siberian heatwave last year saw temperatures more than 5C above the previous record between January and June.\nA study by the Met Office on the extreme heat in the Russian region found that reaching such temperatures was almost impossible without human-caused climate change.\nIt anticipates similar results from studies of the Canadian heatwave.  \nIts initial calculations suggest the odds of the sort of temperatures experienced in Canada occurring without climate change are very low indeed, says Professor Stott.\n\"It is telling us that changes in average climate are leading to rapid escalation not just of extreme temperatures, but of extraordinarily extreme temperatures,\" he adds. \nThat is exactly what the science says we should expect, Prof Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University told the BBC.\n\"Every decade the world has increased the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and that has increased the rate of warming. So, of course, heat records are being broken more frequently,\" she maintains.\nProf Otto believes the risks from the increasing number of heatwaves the world now experiences is not taken seriously enough.\nStorms and flood provide dramatic before-and-after images and cause widespread damage to property.\nHeatwaves, by contrast, do not leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Prof Otto describes them as \"silent killers\".\n\"People rarely drop dead on the street, but die quietly in their poorly insulated and un-air-conditioned homes.\"\nIndeed, how many victims these events claim is often only apparent months after the event when statisticians can calculate excess mortality.  \nProf Otto says even if we do manage to achieve the dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that many countries around the world are now committed to, we will still see more frequent and more intense heatwaves than we have today.\nShe advises that, alongside cutting carbon emissions, we should be investing in adaption and resilience to ensure our communities can withstand the higher temperatures we can expect in the future.

      "text": "Labour is proposing a change in the rules that, if approved, could see Delyn MP Rob Roberts facing a recall petition and possible by-election.\nHe was suspended from Parliament for six weeks in May for sexual misconduct but did not face a petition.\nThis was because sexual harassment and bullying cases are dealt with by an independent panel under Commons rules.\nIf approved, Labour's proposal to end a so-called legal loophole could apply retrospectively to Mr Roberts.\nThe Independent Expert Panel found Mr Roberts had sexually harassed a member of his staff.\nHe has apologised and said he would \"continue to serve\" his constituency.\nMr Roberts can return to the House Of Commons on Thursday to sit as an independent MP, as the Conservative whip was withdrawn from him in May.\nCurrently, automatic recall petitions on whether the MP should face a by-election are only triggered by cases looked at by the House of Commons Standards Committee, and where an MP is suspended for more than ten sitting days. \nHowever, complaints for bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct are investigated by the separate panel, and a petition is not triggered even if a similar suspension results.\nUK government ministers are considering plugging this loophole in the rules so MPs suspended for sexual misconduct could in future face a recall petition in their seat. \nHowever, BBC Wales understands that the UK government does not wish any changes to the rules to apply retrospectively to cases that have already been judged. \nThis would mean that MPs such as Rob Roberts would not face a recall petition even if the rules changed in future. \nBut senior Labour politicians, including party leader Sir Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and Thangam Debbonaire, have proposed a rule change that would close this loophole and allow it to apply to previous cases. \nIt would mean that sitting MPs such as Rob Roberts MP, who received a six-week suspension for sexual harassment, could face a recall petition in their seats if Labour won the agreement of the Commons.\nLabour has tabled a motion in Parliament to put forward these proposed changes, but there is not yet a set date for when it could be debated. \nMs Debbonaire, shadow leader of the House of Commons, told the BBC: \"If this rule had been in place, if that loophole had been closed, the people of that MP's constituency - in this case the people of Delyn - would have been able to mount a recall petition if they chose to decide for themselves if they want this person to continue being their MP.\"\nShe agreed that \"retrospectivity is very, very tricky ground\" but said the government \"only this week has introduced legislation with retrospective effect - that's in the building safety bill\". \n\"It's also possible to get legislation turned around really quickly when the government wants to,\" she said, highlighting a licensing rule change to allow pubs to stay open later than usual on Sunday for customers to watch the Euro 2020 final.\n\"If they can do it for the football they can do it for sexual harassment of a member of parliamentary staff - that really, really matters,\" Ms Debbonaire said. \n\"I think if the government is serious about standards in public life... they will allow time for the debate on my motion,\" she added. \n\"If they don't, the only good reasons I can accept are that they bring their own motion and they deal with this problematic MP.\" \nThe matter was raised by Warwick and Leamington Labour MP Matt Western during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions.\nHe said: \"The public will clearly welcome the government's move to introduce emergency legislation for pubs and bars tomorrow to be able to stay open on Sundays later.\n\"However the public will wonder why tomorrow that the member for Delyn will be allowed to return to this House and not be subject to a recall despite being a serious case of sexual harassment.\"\nBoris Johnson said that the MP's sanction \"has come to an end\" and that \"he is not a Conservative MP\".\nDelyn was one of the \"red wall\" Labour seats in north Wales the Conservatives won at the 2019 general election."

      "text": "Former US president Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against tech giants Google, Twitter and Facebook, claiming that he is the victim of censorship.\nThe class action lawsuit also targets the three companies' CEOs.\nMr Trump was suspended from his social accounts in January over public safety concerns in the wake of the Capitol riots, led by his supporters.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Trump called the lawsuit \"a very beautiful development for our freedom of speech\".\nIn a news conference from his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, Mr Trump railed against social media companies and Democrats, who he accused of espousing misinformation.\n\"We are demanding an end to the shadow-banning, a stop to the silencing, and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing, and cancelling that you know so well,\" he said.\nThe suit requests a court order to end alleged censorship. Mr Trump added if they could ban a president, \"they can do it to anyone\".\nNone of the tech companies named have yet responded to the lawsuit, which was filed to a federal court in Florida.\nMr Trump was joined at the announcement by former Trump officials who have since created the not-for-profit America First Policy Institute.\nThe former president called the post that got him banned from Twitter, \"the most loving sentence\". \nAccording to Twitter, the tweets that resulted in Mr Trump's ban for \"glorification of violence\" were from 8 January, two days after the rioting in the nation's capital. The riot followed his repeated claims, without evidence, that the election was rigged in Joe Biden's favour.\nHe wrote that the \"great patriots\" who voted for him will have \"a giant voice\" and \"will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form\", and in another post said he would not attend President Joe Biden's inauguration.\nAt the same time on Wednesday, Mr Trump's Republican allies in Congress released a memo describing their plan \"to take on Big Tech\".\nThe agenda calls for antitrust measures to \"break up\" the companies, and a revamping of a law known as Section 230.\nSection 230, which Mr Trump tried to repeal as president, essentially stops companies like Facebook and Twitter from being liable for the things that users post. It gives the companies \"platform\" rather than \"publisher\" status.\n\"It's a liability protection the likes of which nobody in the history of our country has ever received,\" Mr Trump said, criticising the law on Wednesday.\nHe added that the law invalidates the companies' statuses as private companies.\nThe lawsuit has been criticised by legal experts, who pointed to Mr Trump's habit of issuing lawsuits for media attention but not aggressively defending the claims in court. His argument of free speech infringement has also been questioned by analysts, as the companies he accuses have those same First Amendment protections in determining content on their sites.\nDonald Trump's muzzling on social media has been extremely effective. \nHis megaphone removed, Trump has struggled to be heard at times. \nHis plans for his own social media platform have so far come to nothing. \nThis lawsuit illustrates, if it were needed, just how important the big social media companies are to him. \nA key strategy of Trumpism is being able to speak directly to voters - bypassing traditional media. \nFacebook proved particularly important to Trump - giving him access to millions of Americans at the click of a button. \nExperts believe the lawsuits are unlikely to succeed. \nMr Trump will argue that his First Amendment rights have been violated. But tech companies will say that, as private companies, they have the right to decide who uses their platform - an argument that is likely to succeed. \nHouse Republicans, too, want to introduce legislation that will \"break up\" Big Tech. However, without a majority in either house they will struggle to do so. \nTrump desperately wants to get back into your newsfeed, but that may not be likely to happen anytime soon."

      "text": "North America experienced its warmest June on record, according to the EU's Earth observation programme.\nThat will come as no surprise given the unprecedentedly high temperatures recently recorded during the heatwave that hit Canada and parts of the US.\nBut UK residents may be startled to learn that despite the rain and cloud they experienced, it was the second warmest June on record for Europe.\nIt was also the fourth warmest June ever recorded worldwide.\nCopernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme, produces its figures for world temperatures from computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, aircraft and weather stations around the world.  \nClimate experts say the findings point to a frightening escalation in temperature extremes.  \n\"We are getting used to record high temperatures being recorded somewhere around the world every year now,\" says Prof Peter Stott of the UK Met Office.  \nHe says what meteorologists like him find shocking is not that the world is experiencing more heatwaves but that temperature records are increasingly being broken by such large margins.\nIn Canada and the north-western US, several cities recorded temperatures a full 5 degrees Celsius above previous records. \nA Siberian heatwave last year saw temperatures more than 5C above the previous record between January and June.\nA study by the Met Office on the extreme heat in the Russian region found that reaching such temperatures was almost impossible without human-caused climate change.\nIt anticipates similar results from studies of the Canadian heatwave.  \nIts initial calculations suggest the odds of the sort of temperatures experienced in Canada occurring without climate change are very low indeed, says Professor Stott.\n\"It is telling us that changes in average climate are leading to rapid escalation not just of extreme temperatures, but of extraordinarily extreme temperatures,\" he adds. \nThat is exactly what the science says we should expect, Prof Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University told the BBC.\n\"Every decade the world has increased the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and that has increased the rate of warming. So, of course, heat records are being broken more frequently,\" she maintains.\nProf Otto believes the risks from the increasing number of heatwaves the world now experiences is not taken seriously enough.\nStorms and flood provide dramatic before-and-after images and cause widespread damage to property.\nHeatwaves, by contrast, do not leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Prof Otto describes them as \"silent killers\".\n\"People rarely drop dead on the street, but die quietly in their poorly insulated and un-air-conditioned homes.\"\nIndeed, how many victims these events claim is often only apparent months after the event when statisticians can calculate excess mortality.  \nProf Otto says even if we do manage to achieve the dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that many countries around the world are now committed to, we will still see more frequent and more intense heatwaves than we have today.\nShe advises that, alongside cutting carbon emissions, we should be investing in adaption and resilience to ensure our communities can withstand the higher temperatures we can expect in the future.

      "text": "A man who stabbed two sisters at random in a supposed demonic pact - a \"sacrifice\" he seemingly believed would enable him to win the lottery - has been found guilty of their murder.\nDanyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman at Fryent Country Park in Wembley on 6 June 2020.\nHe repeatedly stabbed them after a birthday party for Ms Henry.\nTheir bodies were found there by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police.\nThe Old Bailey heard how the sisters had been with a small group of friends to celebrate Ms Henry's 46th birthday.\nWhen the others left they decided to stay as they were enjoying themselves. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced, the trial heard.\nAfter they failed to make it home, loved ones went back to the park to search for them and two days later found the women's sunglasses and a knife.\nAdam Stone, 27-year-old Ms Smallman's partner, then discovered the two bodies intertwined in the undergrowth while he was on the phone to the police.\nIn a victim impact statement read out in court, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: \"No-one expects their children to die before them but to have two of your three children murdered overnight is just incomprehensible.\n\"If any good comes out of this, at least another four women will not meet a similar end in a so-called pact with a so-called demon.\"\nIt can be reported for the first time that Hussein had previously been referred by his school to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent.\nIn October 2017, aged 15, he was referred to the de-radicalisation scheme because of content he had accessed on school computers, including far-right material. \nHussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult.\nHe was put on the \"Channel programme\" - for the most concerning Prevent cases - which discharged him in 2018, although he was seen again six and 12 months later.\nChannel involves a multi-agency panel responsible for assessing the risk posed by a referred person. The programme is then charged with developing a support plan for the individual concerned.\nDuring the trial, the jury heard Ms Henry had been stabbed eight times and Ms Smallman 28 times.\nHussein also cut himself during the attack and it was DNA evidence found at the crime scene that connected him to the murders.\nNearly a month after the deaths, a DNA familial link was made by police to Hussein's father, who had a past caution, and officers raided the defendant's home.\nIn his bedroom, they found three lottery tickets folded inside a letter signed in blood. In it, Hussein promised to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot.\nOver the 10 days following the killings, he spent more than \u00a3160 on lottery tickets and bets, all without success.\nIn another note found in his room, Hussein offered blood to \"demon Queen Byleth\" in exchange for making a girl at his school fall in love with him.\nThe jury heard blood found in the park was a billion times more likely to have come from the teenage suspect than anyone else, while CCTV footage showed him buying a set of knives from Asda the day before the killings.\nFollowing his arrest he told police he had Asperger's syndrome and trouble with his memory, but then refused to answer any questions.\nHussein did not give evidence during the trial but denied he was the person who carried out the killings.\nAs well as being convicted of two counts of murder, he was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon.\nThe 19-year-old is due to be sentenced on 22 September.\nMrs Justice Whipple ordered psychiatric reports to be carried out ahead of sentencing. She told the defendant he faced a long prison term.\nDet Ch Insp Simon Harding, the senior investigating officer, described the case as \"one of the most shocking and chilling\" he had dealt with.\nHe said the two victims \"had lots of friends and lived life to the full\", while footage taken by them on the night they died showed \"their bond and shared pleasure in being in each other's company\".\nThe senior officer also described Hussein as an \"arrogant\" and \"evil\" killer who had acted as a \"belligerent child\" in court.\n\"He has behaved like a teenage boy but he has committed some of the most savage crimes we have seen for many years,\" he said.\nTwo Met Police officers, PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 32, have been charged with misconduct in public office for taking \"non-official and inappropriate photographs\" of the murder scene. \nThe pair, who are both suspended from duty, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 July to enter a plea formally.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is carrying out a separate inquiry into how the Met handled calls from worried relatives and friends of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry before their bodies were discovered."

      "text": "As theatre shows rejoice at reopening, one actress has had extra cause for celebration - after receiving a surprise onstage marriage proposal.\nNatalie Pilkington from the musical Six said she was \"absolutely gobsmacked\" when boyfriend Andy McGuire got down on one knee after the show's finale. \nAfter she said \"yes\", the audience at Leeds Grand went wild and the rest of the cast threw confetti.\nPilkington adds she \"literally had absolutely no idea\" of McGuire's plan.\nPilkington is what is known as a \"swing\" performer, who understudies several roles, on the UK touring production of Six - an uproarious romp which turns Henry VIII's wives into Beyonc\u00e9 and Ariana-style divas. \nOn Saturday, she was starring as Anne Boleyn, a part she played for the first time on the tour last month. \n\"I'm what you call a super-swing. I cover all six of the parts, so it's a rarity that I go on very often,\" 31-year-old Pilkington, from Chorley, Lancashire, told BBC News. \n\"But I believe that Andy had organised it all. Andy had been arranging with the office at Six and with my agent to make sure that I was going to be on stage, but I literally had absolutely no idea,\" she added.\nShe said she was told there was going to be a charity announcement at the end of Saturday night's finale.\nOne of the other cast members then welcomed a man called Andy onto the stage. \n\"And then when my Andy walked out, I was just like, 'Oh my God, what's he doing here?',\" said the actress. \n\"I think I just knew straight away what was going to happen when I saw him in his suit and everything, but I was gobsmacked. Absolutely gobsmacked.\"\nMcGuire, 34, from Leeds, and Pilkington have been together for four-and-a-half years. \nThe actress recently returned to the stage after working as a teaching assistant in a special needs school when theatres shut at the start of the pandemic.\nShe said she thinks McGuire had been planning various ways to pop the question all through lockdown but kept being thwarted as anything he'd booked was later cancelled. \n\"I think he just thought in the end, you know what, we're going to do it the safest way and probably the best way,\" said Pilkington.\nSix started life at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2017 and went on to become a West End smash.\nIt received five Olivier Award nominations and was later performed to sell out shows in  Chicago and on Broadway.\nThe current UK tour is continuing until September 2022. The West End production is currently at the Lyric Theatre until 29 August 2021.  \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Personal finance,Housing market,UK economy",
      "text": "House prices dipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out, according to the Halifax. \nPrices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than \u00a321,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains.\nThe lender said it was \"important to put such a moderate decrease in context.\"\nThe Government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic.\nIn the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. \nFrom June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first \u00a3500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels. \nNow a 5% tax kicks in at \u00a3250,000 for properties up to \u00a3925,000. Rates on properties above that are higher. \nFrom October rates are due to return to normal which means the point homebuyers start paying stamp duty will revert back to \u00a3125,001.\nRussell Galley, managing director of the Halifax, said: \"The power of homemovers to drive the market won't fade entirely as the economy recovers,.\"\nHe pointed out that people have been spurred on by increased time spent at home during the pandemic to still look to find properties with more space.\n\"Coupled with buyers chasing the relatively small number of available properties, and continued low borrowing rates, it's a trend which can sustain high average prices for some time to come,\" he said.\nThe average price of a UK property according to the lender is now \u00a3260,358.\nDemand remains high among buyers searching for larger family homes with the average price of a detached property climbing faster than any other type over the past 12 months.\nThese were up by more than 10% or almost \u00a347,000 in cash terms.\nDetached homes now cost on average more than half a million pounds, \u00a3200,000 more expensive than the typical semi-detached house.\nHowever Mr Galley predicted that annual growth will slow more by the end of the year, with unemployment expected to edge higher as job support measures unwind, and the peak of buyer demand now likely to have passed.\n\"This may be the first sign house price growth is starting to run out of steam, but this slight cooling does not mean prices will come crashing back down to where they were last summer,\" said Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton. \nShe said some buyers are holding off marketing their property because they cannot see anywhere to move to: \"That creates a vicious cycle of low supply and consequently causing intense up-bidding on the most desirable properties.\" \nNorth London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said despite the beginning of the end to the stamp duty holiday there was still strength in the market: \"We don't expect this new balance between supply and demand to change much over the next few months, particularly if economic growth can make up for the ending of the furlough scheme.\""

      "text": "Iran has begun the process of producing enriched uranium metal, it has told the global nuclear watchdog.\nTehran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the process was to develop fuel for a research reactor.\nBut uranium metal could also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb.\nEuropean powers said Iran's move breached a nuclear deal and threatened talks to revive it. The US called it an \"unfortunate step backwards\".\nUnder the nuclear deal, Iran agreed not to produce uranium metal or conduct research and development (R&D) on uranium metallurgy for 15 years.\nBut in December, Iran's parliament passed a law requiring the government to bring the metallic uranium factory at the Isfahan Fuel Fabrication Plant on line within five months.\nThe law also called for the production of enriched uranium with a 20% concentration of the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Uranium enriched to that level can be used in research reactors, while weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more.\nIran began producing 20%-enriched uranium in January and the following month it started making uranium metal. \nIranian officials said at the time that the uranium metal was needed to make an advanced fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which is devoted mainly to making radioisotopes for medical purposes. \nOn Tuesday, the IAEA said its Director General Rafael Grossi had informed member states that Iran intended to use 20%-enriched uranium in making fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor. \"In doing so, as part of a multi-stage process, Iran will also produce uranium metal enriched up to 20% U-235,\" it added.\nThe British, French and German foreign ministers said in a joint statement that they had \"grave concerns\" about Iran's decision.\n\"Iran has no credible civilian need for uranium metal R&D and production, which are a key step in the development of a nuclear weapon.\"\n\"With its latest steps, Iran is threatening a successful outcome to the Vienna talks despite the progress achieved in six rounds of negotiations,\" they added.\nRepresentatives of Iran and the five world powers still party to the deal have been meeting in the Austrian capital since April, with US envoys participating indirectly. \nThey are attempting to negotiate a compromise agreement that would see the US rejoin the accord and lift its sanctions, and Iran return to full compliance. \nUS state department spokesperson Ned Price said that although they were not setting a deadline for the talks, \"as time proceeds Iran's nuclear advances will have a bearing on our view of returning to the JCPOA\"."

Three men were arrested, but police say one is no longer a suspect.\nOfficials say the journalist is fighting for his life in hospital.\nThe veteran journalist is well known for his coverage of the criminal underworld, exposing gangsters and drug lords. He has helped police solve a number of high-profile cases, and also investigated cold cases, especially concerning children and teenagers.\nMr de Vries has faced danger because of his work in the past. He has needed police protection after receiving threats in connection with his coverage of criminal cases, and in 2019 police told him he was on the hit list of the Netherlands' most wanted criminal.\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte said the shooting was \"shocking and incomprehensible\", adding that it was an attack on a \"courageous journalist\" and on the freedom of the press.\nKing Willem-Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima said they were \"deeply shocked\" and that \"journalists must be free to carry out their important work without threats.\"\nTributes including flowers, candles and messages have been placed at the scene of the shooting. There have also been strong reactions from outside the Netherlands. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, called the attack a crime against journalism.\n\"We will relentlessly continue to defend the freedom of the press,\" he wrote.\nThe attack happened just after 19:30 (17:30 GMT) on Tuesday, as the journalist was walking away after a chat show on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat in central Amsterdam.\nFive shots were fired at close range and Mr de Vries was hit in the head, local media reported.\nDutch police later said they would continue to hold two men in connection with the shooting. They said a 35-year-old Polish man and a 21-year-old Dutch man would face a magistrate on Friday.\nA third suspect, who is 18 years old, will be released.\nThe attack has put the spotlight once again on the safety of journalists.\nThe International Federation of Journalists called the attack \"another tragic blow to press freedom in Europe.\"\nEuropean Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said \"attacks against journalists are attacks against all of us.\"\nAlthough journalists work in a relatively safe environment in the EU, there have been high-profile killings of investigative reporters in recent years which have shocked the continent.\nLast year, a former soldier in Slovakia was jailed for 23 years for the killing of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e in 2018.  \nIn Malta, two men were charged earlier this year with supplying the car bomb that killed investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017.\nPeter R de Vries has covered numerous high-profile crimes, including the 1983 kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken.\nIn 2013 Heineken's kidnapper, Willem Holleeder, was convicted of making threats against Mr de Vries. \nOne of the Netherlands' most notorious gangsters, Holleeder, was given a life sentence in 2019 for his involvement in five murders.\nA novel Mr de Vries wrote about the case was later adapted into the movie Kidnapping Freddy Heineken, starring Anthony Hopkins.\nThe journalist also won an Emmy Award for a television show he made about Natalee Holloway, a US teenager who disappeared on the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005.\nMr de Vries frequently acted as a spokesperson for witnesses in police or court cases, and had been acting as an adviser to Nabil B, a former gang member testifying in the case against alleged drug lord, Ridouan Taghi.\nThe Moroccan-Dutch suspect and his associates are currently on trial in the Netherlands for murder and drug trafficking.\nThe case has already sent shock waves through Netherlands after Nabil B's previous lawyer Derk Wiersum was assassinated in front of his Amsterdam home in September 2019.\nThe attack has put the spotlight once again on the safety of journalists.\nThe International Federation of Journalists called the attack \"another tragic blow to press freedom in Europe.\""

      "tags": "UK economy,Freight transport,Grant Shapps,Haulage",
      "text": "A temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours has been met with backlash from the industry who say the government is applying a \"sticking plaster\" to driver shortage problems.  \nHGV drivers can increase their daily driving limits from nine to 10 hours or change weekly rest patterns on Monday.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the move would give flexibility to drivers to make slightly longer trips.\nBut the Road Haulage Association said the move wouldn't make any difference.\nThe RHA believes there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers and said the relaxation on driving hour limits was a \"sticking plaster\".\nIt estimates that some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the Covid pandemic.\n\"Relaxing drivers' hours won't make any material difference - and fails to address the underlying issues, which require a package of measures to fix,\" the RHA said.\nThe national officer for road transport at Unite the union, Adrian Jones, also said the announcement would do nothing to resolve the problem of driver shortages.\nHe added: \"Unite will be advising its members to not place themselves in danger and that if they are too tired to drive safely, they have a legal right to refuse to do so. \n\"Unite will fully support those who make that decision, legally and industrially.\"\nLogistics UK, which represents freight businesses, said longer hours would \"heap more pressure on drivers who are already stretched to the limit to deliver\". \nJames Firth, of Logistics UK, said the industry \"vehemently opposed the extension\" and said the government had \"ignored the will of those who will be most affected by the changes\".\n\"Existing drivers have been working flat out since the start of the pandemic, and this could be the final straw for many of them,\" he said.\n\"Instead of trying to paper over the gaps, government should be working with industry to produce a plan to support moving drivers through the current bottleneck of HGV driving tests.\"\nBusinesses and union officials have warned that the driver shortage jeopardises deliveries to supermarkets and other sectors of the economy.\nThe haulage industry is one of a number of sectors having trouble finding suitable staff as the economy reopens, leading some experts to talk of the UK's missing workers.\nAmong those worried is German confectionery giant Haribo, which has said it is struggling to deliver its sweets to shops in the UK. \nMr Shapps said the government had \"ramped up\" the number of driving tests available and would consider other measures.\nThe government said driver safety must not be compromised and operators must notify the Department for Transport if the relaxation is used.\nThe RHA's chief executive, Richard Burnett, said it opposed wholesale extensions to drivers' hours, believing they could be counter-productive by making the job less attractive. \n\"Loading more hours on to drivers that are already exhausted is not the answer - the problem needs more than just a sticking plaster,\" he added.\n\"Ministers should be mindful that road safety is the reason HGV drivers' hours are limited. Relaxing them should only be used as a last resort to resolve short-term issues that cannot be addressed in other ways.\"\nMr Burnett said that as the shortage worsened, drivers' pay rates were going up, often substantially.\n\"Suppliers and retailers should be prepared that these additional costs will be passed on,\" he added. \nA government spokesperson said it had \"already taken action on HGV driver shortages, including ramping up vocational test capacity, and funding apprenticeships\".\n\"Most of the solutions, however, are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,\" they added."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "Customers are fed up with being told they are getting poor service \"because of Covid\", according to research.  \nFirms are being accused of using the pandemic as an excuse for long waits on the telephone or late deliveries, the UK Institute of Customer Service said.\nIt said that consumers were initially tolerant of delays and other issues as businesses fought to cope with the effects of the crisis.\nBut it said a blanket excuse was no longer sufficient.\nThe number of complaints about poor service in the last six months was at its highest level since 2009, according to the institute's survey of 10,000 people.\nThe sectors with the biggest issues were transport, local public services - such as GP surgeries, councils and police services, and telecommunications, the survey suggested.\nA quarter of those asked said that some organisations had used Covid as an excuse for poor service.\n\"Saying 'because of Covid' is not a good phrase,\" said Jo Causon, the institute's chief executive. \"Organisations must not hide behind this blanket statement.\"\nShe said that many businesses had responded admirably to the difficulties created by the pandemic. She said that managed queuing systems, such as inviting people to call at quieter times, was one area of success.\nOthers had gone out of their way to assist people during the crisis, she said. Delays in deliveries had also arisen owing to the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March, and border issues as a result of Brexit.\nRetailers needed to be honest with customers when they started looking at a particular product about any potential delays, she said, so they were aware of how long they might have to wait to inform their decision about what to buy.\nOne energy customer was surprised to see that his new smart meter suggested he was using \u00a345,000 worth of gas an hour.\nThe 50-year-old from Gloucestershire said the meter displayed the extreme gas usage a day after it was fitted.\nWhile the meter was clearly not working properly, the customer said he was more frustrated that his energy company had not offered an explanation, nor sent him any kind of bill for four months.\nThe problems occurred during lockdown. Covid was not used as an excuse, but he found that it seemed almost impossible to get an answer from anyone at the energy firm.\n\"There has been no resolution. I would like to know what I owe,\" he said.\nCitizens Advice has said many gas and electricity customers are still being plagued by inaccurate bills.\nThe Institute of Customer Service said companies should provide \"honest, genuine communication at all stages\" to customers.\nMs Causon said that satisfaction levels has risen slightly as firms had ultimately dealt with issues, but she said businesses needed to work on preventing the complaints in the first place.\nMany customers were willing to pay extra, she said, if they knew they would get better customer service.\nBank First Direct, department store John Lewis, online retailer Amazon, and bike and vehicle company Suzuki topped the institute's table for customer satisfaction.  \nThe first three of these were the only brands in the top 10 which featured in the same survey a year ago."

      "tags": "Newmarket",
      "text": "A former High Court judge's widow, who was cleared of historical sex abuse, has called for those accused to be granted anonymity until charged.\nLady Lavinia Nourse, 77, of Newmarket in Suffolk, was cleared of 17 counts of sexually abusing a boy under 12.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said \"anonymity up to the point of charge\" would be a \"step forward\". \nShe has also questioned \"why the complainant cannot be revealed after the case\".\nLady Lavinia, who was married to Sir Martin Nourse, was accused of abuse by a man known to her two months after her 85-year-old husband died in 2017.\nEighteen months later, she was charged with five counts of indecently assaulting a boy and 12 counts of indecency with a child in the 1980s. All charges related to the same complainant.\nA jury at Peterborough's Nightingale court cleared her of all charges.   Lady Lavinia said she felt the case would not have got to court if she \"hadn't had such a high profile husband\" - a suggestion denied by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\"It was made in the same way as all of our cases - following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with our legal test,\" a CPS spokesman said.\n\"The accuser was very happy to let it be known widely in London, and in and around Newmarket, using his name, and freely admitting that this is what I had done,\" Lady Lavinia said.\n\"It was intolerable on top of everything else. I didn't know who was looking at me, where I could turn, I didn't know who I could trust.\"\nLady Lavinia describes the two-week trial as \"hell\" and said she had \"never been so frightened, lonely, [and] utterly miserable\".\n\"There was a very high chance that if I was found guilty that I would go to jail and I just find it really frightening that people can tell lies that actually can send an innocent person to prison,\" she said. \nShe added it was an \"absolute nightmare\" to have to sit and \"listen to all the ghastly things that were said about me\".\nLady Lavinia said she now wanted to \"raise awareness of the question of anonymity up to the point of charge\".\n\"Everyone remains anonymous, that in itself would be a step forward,\" she said.\n\"I think it's less likely that in the immediate future, we will get anonymity after being charged. \n\"But I would like to ask the question, why can the complainant then not be revealed after the case?\"\nA government spokesman said: \"Current police guidance is clear there should, in general, be a right to anonymity before the point of charge - however there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named.\"\nThe Home Office said once a suspect has been charged, the principle of open justice means that they should be named. \nThis was because experience has shown that naming those charged with serious sexual offences can sometimes encourage others to come forward and ensure justice was done, it added.\nThe guidance said the current approach applied to all offences and struck a balance between the rights of suspects to privacy and the need to prevent and investigate crime.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "House prices dipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out, according to the Halifax. \nPrices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than \u00a321,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains.\nThe lender said it was \"important to put such a moderate decrease in context.\"\nThe Government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic.\nIn the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. \nFrom June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first \u00a3500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels. \nNow a 5% tax kicks in at \u00a3250,000 for properties up to \u00a3925,000. Rates on properties above that are higher. \nFrom October rates are due to return to normal which means the point homebuyers start paying stamp duty will revert back to \u00a3125,001.\nRussell Galley, managing director of the Halifax, said: \"The power of homemovers to drive the market won't fade entirely as the economy recovers,.\"\nHe pointed out that people have been spurred on by increased time spent at home during the pandemic to still look to find properties with more space.\n\"Coupled with buyers chasing the relatively small number of available properties, and continued low borrowing rates, it's a trend which can sustain high average prices for some time to come,\" he said.\nThe average price of a UK property according to the lender is now \u00a3260,358.\nDemand remains high among buyers searching for larger family homes with the average price of a detached property climbing faster than any other type over the past 12 months.\nThese were up by more than 10% or almost \u00a347,000 in cash terms.\nDetached homes now cost on average more than half a million pounds, \u00a3200,000 more expensive than the typical semi-detached house.\nHowever Mr Galley predicted that annual growth will slow more by the end of the year, with unemployment expected to edge higher as job support measures unwind, and the peak of buyer demand now likely to have passed.\n\"This may be the first sign house price growth is starting to run out of steam, but this slight cooling does not mean prices will come crashing back down to where they were last summer,\" said Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton. \nShe said some buyers are holding off marketing their property because they cannot see anywhere to move to: \"That creates a vicious cycle of low supply and consequently causing intense up-bidding on the most desirable properties.\" \nNorth London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said despite the beginning of the end to the stamp duty holiday there was still strength in the market: \"We don't expect this new balance between supply and demand to change much over the next few months, particularly if economic growth can make up for the ending of the furlough scheme.\""

      "tags": "Media,Amsterdam,Journalism,Netherlands",
      "text": "A prominent Dutch journalist known for investigating the criminal underworld has been shot and seriously wounded on a street in central Amsterdam.\nPeter R de Vries, 64, was shot minutes after leaving a TV studio, where he had appeared on a chat show.\nMr de Vries is famed for his work on exposing mobsters and drug lords, and has helped police solve a number of high-profile cases.\nThree men were arrested, but police say one is no longer a suspect.\nHours after the attack, two men were arrested in a car on the A4 motorway at Leidschendam - a 35-year-old Polish national living in Maurik and a 21-year-old man living in Rotterdam. They will face court on Friday.\nAn 18-year-old was arrested in Amsterdam, but will be released.\nThe mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described Mr de Vries as \"a national hero to us all\" and as \"a rare, courageous journalist who tirelessly sought justice\". \nThe attack happened just after 19:30 (17:30 GMT), as the journalist was walking away from the studio on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat.\nFive shots were fired at close range and Mr de Vries, 64, was hit in the head, local media report.\nMr de Vries was previously given police protection after receiving threats for his involvement in criminal cases as an investigative journalist. In 2019 he tweeted that police had told him he was on the hit list of the Netherlands' most wanted criminal.\nMayor Halsema said the journalist was fighting for his life, and condemned the shooting as a \"cruel, heartless attack\".\nPolice are appealing for witnesses and CCTV footage of the shooting but are asking people not to share the material on social media. YouTube said it had removed hundreds of videos from its platform.\nThe attack has shaken the Netherlands, with messages of support for Mr de Vries and the safety of all journalists coming from leading figures across the country.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the shooting as \"shocking and incomprehensible,\" adding it was an attack on a \"courageous journalist\" and on the freedom on the press.\nJustice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus paid tribute to an \"extraordinary journalist\", calling Mr de Vries an \"admirable warrior against injustice for the underdog\".\nKing Willem-Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima said they were \"deeply shocked\" and that \"journalists must be free to carry out their important work without threats.\"\nThere have also been strong reactions from outside the Netherlands. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel called the attack a crime against journalism.\n\"We will relentlessly continue to defend the freedom of the press,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nPeter R de Vries has covered numerous high-profile crimes, including the 1983 kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken.\nIn 2013 Heineken's kidnapper, Willem Holleeder, was convicted of making threats against Mr de Vries. \nOne of the Netherlands' most notorious gangsters, Holleeder was given a life sentence in 2019 for his involvement in five murders.\nA novel Mr de Vries wrote about the case was later adapted into the movie Kidnapping Freddy Heineken starring Anthony Hopkins.\nThe journalist also won an Emmy Award for a television show he made about Natalee Holloway, a US teenager who disappeared on the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005. \nMr de Vries had been acting as an adviser to a former gang member, Nabil B, who was testifying in the case against Ridouan Taghi, who is currently on trial in the Netherlands for murder and drug trafficking.\nThe case has already sent shock waves through Netherlands after Nabil B's previous lawyer Derk Wiersum was assassinated in front of his Amsterdam home in September 2019.\nPeter R de Vries rose to prominence reporting on the types of crimes he appears to have fallen victim to.\nThe attempt on his life has stunned Dutch society, particularly those in the professions where he has played such a critical role - journalism and criminal justice. \nMayor Femke Halsema described Mr de Vries as a national hero, \"brave, looking for justice, free spirit, helping people in distress, parents of murdered children\".\nHe was immersed in the job and his involvement in numerous high-profile cases resulted in repeated calls from the underworld for his \"liquidation\". \nThe Dutch Bar Association has released a statement describing the \"brutal attack\" as having an enormous impact on the legal profession.\nMr de Vries is a regular on Dutch chat shows. Last week he launched a crowdfunding campaign to try to raise a million euros to solve a cold case before the parents of the victim, Tanja Groen, passed away.\nHumberto Tan, a TV presenter, described Mr de Vries as a journalist with an enormous heart.

      "text": "The advertising watchdog, the ASA, has banned an advert by controversial brewer Brewdog for misleading claims.\nAn Instagram post for its Clean & Press Hard Seltzer said: \"Due to advertising regulations we cannot claim this drink is healthy,\" but continued with a reference to a low calorie claim. \nBrewdog said the ad was \"tongue-in-cheek\" but agreed not to use it again.\nBrewdog was also reported to the ASA last week for claiming a competition prize was solid gold and worth \u00a315,000.\nThe Scottish firm had offered 10 people the chance to find a gold can hidden in a case of its beer.\nSeveral winners of the gold beer can prize contested Brewdog's claim about its value when they discovered it was merely gold plated. \nBrewdog said it stood by the valuation. Meanwhile, the Advertising Standards Authority continues to look into whether the competition breached any of its rules.\nThe company's ad for its Clean & Press seltzer ran in January. It said: \"Even though Clean & Press is only 90 calories per can, with no carbs or sugar and a little bit of alcohol, this is not a health drink. If you are looking for a health drink, do not drink Clean & Press.\"\nThe ASA also challenged whether the ad used nutrition claims that were not permitted for alcoholic drinks and whether the phrase \"a little bit of alcohol\" implied that the drink was low alcohol despite the product having an alcoholic strength by volume (ABV) of 5%.\nThe ASA said \"only 90 calories per can\" and \"no carbs or sugar\" were nutrition claims that were not permitted for alcoholic drinks, as was the implication that the product was beneficial to overall good health or health-related wellbeing.\nThe ASA said consumers would understand the claim \"a little bit of alcohol\" to mean that the product was low alcohol when it had an ABV of 5%, finding that the ad breached the Advertising Code on this point also.\nA Brewdog spokesman said: \"We have accepted the ASA ruling and have removed the wording in question.\"\nIn separate rulings, the ASA also banned two Instagram posts by rival Drty Drinks for making misleading nutrition claims for an alcoholic drink and for encouraging excessive drinking and website posts by the High Water and Whisp Drinks firms for making misleading and non-permitted nutrition claims for alcoholic drinks. \nBrewdog was founded in 2007 by boss James Watt and Martin Dickie.\nIt has been attracting negative scrutiny in recent weeks after a letter from ex-workers was posted on Twitter which said a \"significant number\" of former staff had \"suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog\".\nIt made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.\nThe company has promised an independent review of the issues raised and has apologised to staff for the \"lot of pain\" they have been caused.\nThe fast-growing Scottish brewer and pub chain has enjoyed rapid success and employs 2,000 staff. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions."

The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Kate Forbes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland is still on track to see Covid restrictions lifted next month, the Scottish government has said. \nFinance Secretary Kate Forbes said the plan was for Scotland to move to level zero on 19 July, with remaining legal restrictions lifted on 9 August.\nMs Forbes said the data would be closely monitored, after it was revealed that Scotland has the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nMost of England's Covid restrictions are due to end on 19 July.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that in England face masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrapped. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Forbes said many restrictions would be eased as planned in Scotland too - despite the record high number of Covid cases reported in recent weeks. \nHowever, she said some measures, such as the wearing of face coverings, would remain in place in Scotland. \n\"We expect some baseline measures - for example face masks, some limitations on working from home and so on - will continue for a longer period of time,\" she said.  \n\"We are lifting the limits and lifting as much of the legal restrictions as possible. So that means physical distancing, it means the attendee caps on, for example, life events like weddings or being in stadiums and that kind of thing. \n\"But we do think that there will still be some baseline measures, for example, the wearing of face masks which will continue for a longer period of time.\" \nShe said the virus was still with us, and that we were at a \"fragile moment\" in the pandemic. \nAlthough the virus is still highly contagious, the link between transmission and hospitalisation has been weakened but not broken completely, she said. \nThe finance secretary added that the data was being closely monitored, and that the plans for what will be lifted on 19 July would be unveiled on 13 July.   \nScotland's exit from lockdown is following the same pattern as much of the rest of the pandemic.\nThe rhetoric from politicians in Edinburgh is notably more cautious than that of their counterparts in London, but ultimately they are all traveling on the same path.\nWords like \"irreversible\" and \"guarantee\" are absent, but ministers still bat away any question of delaying their plans or re-imposing any restrictions.\nAnd while there is talk of retaining \"mitigations\" like face coverings, it remains unclear whether this will be a legal requirement, or simply guidance - and thus in effect no different to plans down south.\nThere is a particular challenge for politicians, who are pulled in different directions by the complexities of the pandemic and managing the public's expectations as well as their behaviour.\nThe Scottish government has developed a reputation as a careful, canny operation - but ministers also apparently feel compelled to lift restrictions despite case numbers hitting record highs.\nAnd the opposition Scottish Conservatives are in a similarly curious bind, finding themselves stressing how awful the situation is - while insisting that ministers continue with the current plan.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' Douglas Ross said it was time to learn to live with the virus, and called for restrictions to be eased as planned in the weeks ahead. \nHe told Good Morning Scotland: \"People die from a number of ailments all the time. And we have to learn to live with Covid-19. It's going to be with us going forward and I think it is time to start to get our lives back to normal as much as possible.\"\nHe said there were other harms caused by Covid restrictions. \n\"We are also seeing people during this pandemic dying from cancer - because they weren't diagnosed in time, or couldn't get their treatment, or they didn't feel they were able to go and see their doctor or get an appointment at hospital over the last 16 months,\" he said.\n\"We cannot simply say we are going to keep lockdown to stop people dying from Covid if they are suffering or dying of other illnesses.\" \nOn whether people should continue to be mandated to wear face masks, Mr Ross said it should be a personal decision. \n\"I think that is a personal decision and one that is perfectly acceptable,\" he said.  \nOn Monday, there were 2,372 new cases of Covid confirmed in Scotland. Last week saw the most Covid-19 cases than at any point during the pandemic, with a peak of 4,234 new infections recorded on 1 July.\nThe national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, attributed this to a lack of \"natural immunity\" in the population. \nHe said Scotland had been hit hard by the more infectious Delta variant becoming \"seeded\" in Glasgow. \nProf Leitch also linked the surge in part to people gathering to watch Euro 2020 matches.\nHowever, he said hospital admissions and deaths were not rising at the same rates they were earlier in the pandemic - because of the protection offered by vaccination.\nHe added that a \"big wave\" of Covid infections, fuelled by the Delta strain, was likely to overtake other parts of Europe in the weeks ahead."

      "text": "Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse has been killed and his wife injured in an attack on their home in the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince.\nUnidentified gunmen stormed the property at 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT), interim PM Claude Joseph said.\nHe has called for calm and declared a state of emergency nationwide.\nMr Mo\u00efse had led Haiti, one of the poorest nations in the world, since 2017 but had faced widespread protests demanding his resignation.\nThe nation's recent history has been plagued by coups, political instability and widespread gang violence.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he was \"saddened at the death of Mr Mo\u00efse\", calling it \"an abhorrent act\" and appealing for calm. US President Joe Biden offered condolences to the people of Haiti for the \"horrific assassination\".\nFirst Lady Martine Mo\u00efse later reportedly arrived by plane in Fort Lauderdale, south Florida, for treatment. There is no official word on her condition.\nMr Joseph called the shooting of the president a \"heinous, inhuman and barbaric act\", saying the attackers were \"foreigners who spoke English and Spanish\". Haiti's official languages are Creole and French.\nSome reports spoke of men dressed in black carrying high-powered weapons who may have pretended to be part of a US drug enforcement operation, although no official details have been given.\nHaiti's ambassador to the US, Bocchit Edmond, said there was \"no way\" US drugs agents carried out the attack. He believed it was the work of \"professional mercenaries\".\nAddressing the nation, Mr Joseph vowed the killers would be brought to justice and said the security situation was \"under control\".\nThe state of emergency, or \"state of siege\", allows for the banning of gatherings and use of the military for police roles, along with other extensions of executive powers.\nMr Joseph said that \"all measures have been taken to ensure continuity\" and that \"democracy and the republic will win\".\nBut questions remain about how much control Mr Joseph can assert.\nHaiti's constitution says ministers, under the leadership of the prime minister, take control in the event of presidential vacancy until elections can be called.\nBut that also remains unclear, as a new prime minister, Ariel Henry, was named by Mr Mo\u00efse just this week but has yet to be sworn in.\nThe US later said it believed elections should go ahead this year, to bring about a peaceful transfer of power.\nThe US has been Haiti's biggest donor for 50 years but has had a fractious relationship with some of its rulers and has carried out a number of blockades and interventions.\nThe country has also had strong counter-narcotics ties with Haiti to try to prevent South American drugs being shipped through the nation and on to the US.\nThe streets of Port-au-Prince appeared to be mostly calm on Wednesday.\nOne resident, Pascale Solages, told the BBC: \"We are on our cell phones, our radio, our television, waiting for what happens next... everyone is scared.\"\nThe neighbouring Dominican Republic ordered the \"immediate closure\" of its border with Haiti.\nJovenel Mo\u00efse, 53, had been in power since February 2017.\nHis time in office was rocky as he faced accusations of corruption and there were widespread demonstrations in the capital and other cities earlier this year.\nHaiti's opposition said that Mr Mo\u00efse's five-year term should have ended on 7 February 2021, five years to the day since his predecessor, Michel Martelly, stepped down.\nBut there had been a year's delay to elections after Mr Martelly's departure, and Mr Mo\u00efse insisted he had one more year to serve as he did not take office until 7 February 2017.\nParliamentary elections should have been held in October 2019 but disputes have delayed them, meaning Mr Mo\u00efse had been ruling by decree.\nIn February this year, on the day the opposition wanted him to leave office, Mr Mo\u00efse said an attempt to kill him and overthrow the government had been foiled.\nHaiti has also faced a wave of recent gang violence and kidnappings, particularly in the capital, with a number of its districts becoming no-go areas.\nThe worsening living standards in the nation of 11 million people have pushed nearly 60% below the poverty line.\nAn earthquake in 2010 killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to the infrastructure and the economy.\nA UN peacekeeping force was put in place in 2004 to help stabilise the country, and only withdrew in 2017, but the turmoil has shown no sign of ending."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The delay to ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid could lead to millions being asked to self-isolate this summer. \nThe knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS, could be huge, ministers are being warned.\nThe government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England.\nBut BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could still be asked to self-isolate between now and then. \nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of \"ignoring the next big problem that's heading down the track\" as he said \"millions\" would have to self-isolate as cases rose.\n\"It won't feel like freedom day to those who have to isolate, when they're having to cancel their holidays, when they can't go to the pub or even to their kid's sports day,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said the country was \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\".\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said the system was already causing \"carnage\". And chief executive Kate Nicholls added the government's plans did not go \"far enough, quickly enough\".\nHospital bosses have also expressed concern.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said: \"Trust leaders know self-isolation requirements are an ongoing source of frustration for some staff, particularly amongst those who have had both vaccinations, tested negative and want to support their colleagues at a time when there is very high pressure on staffing levels. \n\"There is a major risk that this situation will become more challenging after 19 July when all remaining restrictions are lifted, with the expectation that even more NHS staff will have to self-isolate as community infections rates spike. This is a real current cause of concern amongst trust leaders.\"\nA conservative guess is that we might see 1.5 million cases in the four weeks after 19 July - that would be just over 50,000 cases a day on average. \nAbout three close contacts have been identified for every Covid case reported, according to Test and Trace figures for England in the last month.\nSo, 1.5 million cases, each with about three contacts, gives us between four and five million contacts who might be asked to isolate between 19 July and 16 August.\nAnd, once restrictions are lifted on 19 July and society opens up further, we might expect to see the numbers of contacts to rise.      \nThis is a very rough calculation. The true figures could, of course, be lower or even higher. \nBut it's looking increasingly clear that millions of people will be close contacts of people with coronavirus and legally required to self-isolate in the weeks before England changes the rules.\nSo why are we doing it? Clearly there is a risk scrapping the self-isolation policy would push up the infection rate.\nThe hope is in another month the rise in cases will have peaked and the change would not be as risky.\nEngland is seeing close to 25,000 cases a day on average with cases doubling every 10 days.\nAnd with the remaining restrictions - such as social distancing, limits on the gatherings and the need to wear masks - set to be lifted on 19 July, ministers have warned the public they need to be braced for very high infection levels.\nOn Tuesday Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned there could be as many as 100,000 cases a day.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has conceded the plan to keep self-isolation requirements in place after the end of other restrictions in England was \"not a perfect solution\".\nHe added: \"You can't have it both ways. On the one hand we're saying we want to reopen but we're giving a measure of precaution in terms of delaying the lifting of self-isolation restrictions.\n\"It's a balance, it's not a perfect solution.\"\nUnder-18s, who are not currently entitled to the vaccine, will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are close contacts of a confirmed Covid case in England. \nOther parts of the UK are also seeing rising rates, which will mean many people will be asked to self-isolate. But those nations have not announced what they plan to do about self-isolation as they open up.\nSelf-isolation for people who have symptoms will still be required in England.\nIt is defined by the government as a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for Covid.\nIt can be anyone who:\nYou can be deemed a contact any time from two days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms - or, if they did not have any symptoms, from two days before the date their positive test was taken."

      "text": "Lithuania has announced it will build a barrier on the border with Belarus and deploy troops to prevent migrants from illegally crossing into its territory.\nPrime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said more than 1,000 migrants had been held after crossing along the 679km (422-mile) border since 1 June.\nLithuania, an EU member, also accused Belarus of flying in foreign migrants and allowing them to go to the border.\nBilateral ties have been strained since May's arrest of a Belarusian dissident.\nRoman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were flying from Greece to Lithuania when a fighter jet was scrambled over Belarus to escort their plane to Minsk airport over a bomb threat which turned out to be fake.\nThey were detained as soon as the Ryanair plane landed.\nThe EU and other Western nations also accuse Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of rigging last year's elections.\nMr Lukashenko, who has been in power for 27 years and is sometimes called Europe's last dictator, rejects the allegation.\nAt Wednesday's news briefing in Lithuania's capital Vilnius, Ms Simonyte said \"an additional physical barrier\" would be built on the border with Belarus.\nShe said this would be \"a certain sign and a certain deterrent to organisers of the illegal migration flows\".\n\"To assist our border officers, our army forces will be used to increase the number of people physically guarding the border,\" Ms Simonyte added.\nIn the whole of last year, Lithuanian border guards detained 81 illegal migrants crossing from its southern neighbour - a far lower number than that seen in recent weeks. \nMs Simonyte accused Belarus of offering migrants flights to the Belarusian capital Minsk, citing evidence found on at least one such person who had reached Lithuania.\n\"There are travel agencies, direct flights that connect Minsk with Baghdad [Iraq's capital] for example, and there are agencies both in Belarus and other countries that operate and attract 'tourists' to Minsk,\" Ms Simonyte told Reuters news agency.\nMeanwhile, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said a large number of illegal migrants trying to cross into Lithuania from Belarus had been flown in from Turkey.  \nHe said he had asked his Turkish counterpart to help identify any such arrivals.\nThe EU has already sent personnel from its from its border agency Frontex to Lithuania's border to help deal with the growing migrant crisis.\nMr Lukashenko has repeatedly warned that Belarusian authorities will no longer be trying to stop an influx of illegal migrants from abroad to EU members.\n\"If some think that we will close our borders with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine and become a camp for people fleeing Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Tunisia they are mistaken,\" Mr Lukashenko said on Tuesday.\n\"We won't hold anyone, they are coming not to us but to the enlightened, warm and cozy Europe,\" he added mockingly."

      "tags": "Easyjet,Center Parcs,British Airways,Air travel,Ryanair,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "From Monday 19 July the government has said wearing face coverings in England will be recommended but not mandatory. \nIt says bus and train companies must now decide whether passengers have to continue to wear face coverings, with rules being replaced by government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services.\nSome airlines have already confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July, while other businesses, including shops, pubs and hairdressers, are setting out updated policies. \nSo, following government confirmation of the easing of rules, what are businesses' intentions?\nMartin Dalby chief executive of Center Parcs said masks would be encouraged for both staff and customers in the indoor sections of its holiday parks.\n\"The approach from Center Parcs will be to recommend that both our employees and our customers do wear face coverings when in indoor settings - that's the advice we're going to give them.\" But he added: \"It's not mandatory and we won't be policing it.\"'\nHe also said they would not be asking for a Covid passport, proving vaccination status. \nClive Watson, chief executive of the City Pub Group, which has 45 pubs across the south of England and Wales, has said masks will be encouraged after 19 July and as much table service as possible will continue: \"We don't want a free-for-all scrum at the bar, loads of people queuing up.\"\nStaff will also be encouraged to continue to wear masks. \nHowever, Chris Jowsey, chief executive of Admiral Taverns, which has 1,000 pubs, has said the lifting of all restrictions is \"long overdue\". He adds that 19 July will \"be critical for the future of our industry, supporting community hubs across the UK and allowing businesses to operate as normal once again\".\nThe boss of the Timpson shoe repair and key cutting chain, Sir John Timpson, says he will leave mask wearing as a matter of personal choice for his customers: \"I don't think the way it's going we've got any right, we shouldn't expect them to do so, that's entirely up to the customer.\" \nBut he said his staff would be asked to wear masks.\n\"We will certainly advise them that what they should be doing as far as masks are concerned is to do the right thing to look after our customers - and that means wearing a mask when customers are within the shop.\n\"The wearing of masks is not mainly to protect yourself, it is to protect other people, and I think that we've still got to do that even though there's no legal requirement to do so.\" \nShop workers union Usdaw had previously urged the government not to lift Covid safety measures in shops. \n\"Retail staff are working with the public every day and are deeply worried about catching Covid-19,\" said Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary.\n\"This is not the right time to water down safety in stores and the government should not be removing the requirements for face coverings and distancing in busy public areas like shops.\"\nSainsbury's boss Simon Roberts has said mask wearing in stores will be a matter of \"personal choice\" after 19 July. And the Westfield shopping centre group has said it will \"encourage\" customers to wear masks. \nThe focus on masks is disproportionate to the impact they can have. Retaining mask-wearing is not going to significantly alter the course of the rising infections.\nThe fact remains the most important measure is for people to isolate when ill.\nInstead, the debate is symbolic of a wider issue - the importance of communication and messaging.\nThere's real frustration among government scientists about the mixed messaging coming out on masks as they fear it gives the impression we no longer need to be careful.\nThat's not true because how quickly normal behaviour returns - and that means everything from ditching masks and returning to the office as well as clubbing - makes a big difference to the summer wave.\nAn immediate return to normal could make the peak of hospital admissions twice as high as a more gradual return.\nThe modellers believe this is much more important than delaying the lifting of restrictions, which will have very limited impact on the peak.\nIt's why England's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing the need to go slowly with the new freedoms - and why the way mask-wearing is communicated is crucial.\nLesley Blair, chair of the British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology (BABTAC), a membership organisation and insurance provider for professionals working in the industry, would like mask wearing to continue. Ms Blair says that the organisation will encourage members to consider the the evidence as part of their risk assessments and continue to wear them \"especially when working in the breathing zone\". \nAmong smaller businesses, Joe Hemmings, who owns two hairdressers in Bristol, says he'll be taking a staged approach to mask wearing: \"To go from all of the PPE to nothing overnight is too radical for the sheer fact of peoples' anxiety and the need for precaution.\" \nEight of his 17 staff are aged about 30 and won't have had their second jab by 19 July. \"We need to make sure we can do everything we can to protect the team,\" he says.  \nIf customers refuse to wear a mask, Mr Hemmings says \"it's a tricky one\" but he'll \"have to honour\" their decision. \"We'd like to think it is everyone's best interest for us all to wear them inside,\" he adds.  \nRyanair has said masks will be mandatory, regardless of the departing destination. A spokesperson added that this was in keeping with current guidance from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\nBritish Airways has also said it sees no reason yet to change its existing rules, requiring staff and customers to wear masks, but said it was keeping its policies under constant review.\nEasyJet and Virgin have also told customers that passengers should continue to wear them.\nPassengers flying with Jet2 will not be allowed to board their flight without a face mask, unless they have previously given a reason for not wearing one.\nThe Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said some of the 3.8 million people classed as clinically vulnerable would be \"fearful\" to go on public transport if masks were not compulsory.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had not yet taken the decision whether to require masks on trams in Manchester as he wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion.\nIndustry body the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, says that travelling by train is \"low-risk\" and \"any decision to leave public transport behind other parts of the economy would need to be based on the science\".\nHowever, the Unite union has said previously that dropping mask-wearing on public transport would be \"gross negligence\". \nUnite's national officer for passenger transport, Bobby Morton, pointed to the number of deaths from Covid among bus drivers.\nHe has said that not only does mask wearing reduce transmissions, it helps provide reassurance to drivers and to passengers who are nervous about using public transport."

So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. In the US, the majority of homicides are gun-related. \nUS President Joe Biden unveiled a White House strategy to combat the rise in homicides in late June, which includes curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. It also delegates more funding for personnel - including law enforcement.\nGovernor Cuomo's state disaster declaration describes gun violence as a public health crisis, and made several comparisons to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health response. \n\"If you look at the recent numbers, more people are now dying from gun violence and crime than Covid,\" the Democratic governor said. \n\"Just like we did with Covid, New York is going to lead the nation once again with a comprehensive approach to combating and preventing gun violence.\"\nMr Cuomo's emergency declaration releases emergency funds that he will direct towards: \nAs New York emerged as the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak last year, Mr Cuomo was widely hailed by US media for his handling of the pandemic.\nHe has since faced accusations of a cover-up since it emerged his office undercounted Covid-19 deaths among its nursing home residents by thousands, after his administration issued a directive in March 2020 ordering those facilities to take in coronavirus patients.\nScrutiny of the governor was compounded by multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, including those of current and former state employees - which he denies.\nA recent poll by Siena College found that just one-third of voters in the majority Democratic state want Mr Cuomo to run for re-election. Nearly a quarter of those polled said he should resign immediately. "

And as the Treasury grapples with the cost of the pandemic, some believe the money should be cut. \nThere are, however, a number of prominent and influential Tories who want it to stay.\nNot just former DWP minister, including Iain Duncan Smith, who brought in universal credit, but also many new Tory MPs, representing northern seats the party won from Labour in 2019. \nThis is going to be a big issue in the coming weeks - and the government is going to come under a lot of pressure - not just from opposition parties. \nBut Ms Coffey said that, just as its introduction last year had been decided collectively by ministers, so was the decision to wind it down.\nThe government's focus was on jobs and \"all the things we can do to help people work more hours\", she added.\nLabour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said the plans would hit the lowest paid hardest and \"hurt our economic recovery\".\n\"There is near universal opposition to this cut, including from prominent Conservatives. It is time the government saw sense, backed struggling families and cancelled their cut to universal credit\", he said."

with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week.\nOn Monday, the prime minister confirmed he intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictions in England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing.\nA further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: \"From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated.\n\"If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms.\" \nAs under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them.\nMr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be \"advised\" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age.\nPeople identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nHe added that \"of course\" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers \"it makes sense\" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August.\nIt said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs.\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement \"doesn't go far enough, quickly enough\".\nChief executive Kate Nicholls said it \"fails to recognise the carnage the current system\" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who \"have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive\".\nThe NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move \"may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid\".\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing \"the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country\", Mr Javid said.\nEarlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be \"at least double\" what they were now \"so around 50,000 new cases a day\".\n\"As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,\" he said. \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK \"building a protective wall\" of vaccines. \nHowever, Mr Ashworth said the \"wall is only part built\", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people.\nHe said he \"understood the rationale\" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the \"biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy\" was a \"lack of financial incentive to stay at home\".\nHe also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: \"Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way.\"\nThe Scottish government has said it may continue to require masks in certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end.\nAhead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said people would need to learn to live with Covid.\nNorthern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless.\nShe said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would \"not be following that model\". \nIreland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan \"too risky\" and warned if things went wrong there would be a \"spillover effect\" into neighbouring countries.\nAsked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: \"Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place.\"\nThe lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves.\nNo other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant.\nSo, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether.\nIf cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter.\nSoon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000.\nThese are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to.\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could \"still cause some pressure to the health system\".\nHowever he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a \"slight gamble\" he thought it was \"justifiable\", adding \"I'm reasonably optimistic.\"\nHe said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. \"The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold.\"\nIn the worst-case scenario there \"may need to be a course correction later\", he added.\nBusinesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July.\nMelvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had \"got this right\", adding that \"the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen\". \nHe also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors.\nHowever, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still \"encourage guests\" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe."

      "text": "Sydney residents will be in lockdown for another week as Australia's largest city fights to contain a Covid outbreak.\nThe New South Wales government said it had made the \"difficult decision\" as it battles the highly transmissible Delta strain.\nA stay-at-home order was issued on 26 June.\nAustralia has recorded 910 deaths and fewer than 31,000 cases since the pandemic began. \nClusters have emerged after some people who were later found to be infected left their homes for essentials.\nThe outbreak of around 330 cases is the worst in the city this year.\nA stay-at-home order covering more than five million residents in the Greater Sydney, Wollongong and Central Coast areas was due to be lifted on Friday. It has now been extended to 16 July. Schools will also be closed next week.\nThe New South Wales government said it recognised the \"pain and stress\" that lockdown was causing families and businesses.\nYet officials said the daily case rate - with 27 new cases recorded on Wednesday - and low levels of vaccination meant the restrictions needed to be extended.\nLess than 10% of Australians are fully vaccinated. A lack of supplies, specifically of the Pfizer vaccine, means many Australians will not be able to get a jab until the final months of the year.\n\"What we want to do is give us our best chance of making sure this is the only lockdown we have until the vast majority of our citizens are vaccinated,\" said Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday.\n\"We don't want to be in a situation where we are constantly having to move between lockdown and no lockdown.\"\nSydney has been the hardest hit by Australia's recent outbreak of the Delta variant, though cases have spread across the country. \nLeaks of the virus from hotel quarantine last week prompted snap lockdowns of state capital cities - including Brisbane, Darwin and Perth - affecting half the population of the country.\nAuthorities in those cities have been able to contain the virus and ended lockdowns last week.\nAustralia has used lockdowns and swift contact tracing to combat outbreaks of the virus when it has breached the nation's strict border defences."

      "text": "France's national rail operator is warning people not to take selfies on tracks as reported incidents rise during the coronavirus pandemic. \nThe SNCF railway company said people were trespassing and taking dangerous risks to capture images at a time of reduced rail services and surveillance. \nThis week the operator began publishing a series of video messages it said would continue to run until next month.\nAlong with France, the UK has also seen a recent rise in such incidents.\nThe SNCF launched the new video series on social media networks on Monday, using the hashtag #SurLesRails (#OnRails). It said the content of the posts was \"inspired by real events\". \nThe campaign uses slogans such as \"taking pictures on the tracks is to risk never taking pictures again\", and highlights the dangers including the risk of being hit by a train, high-voltage electrocution and a serious fall.\nThe SNCF said that new guidance would be released each week as part of an ongoing risk prevention campaign. \nMeasures introduced in the country last year to help reduce the spread of Covid-19 have meant that fewer trains have been in use, while track maintenance work and surveillance has also been reduced.\nThe SNCF said that this was likely to be behind an increase in reported incidents of people visiting sites illegally and taking pictures, which are then shared on social media sites such as Instagram. \n\"Every week in France, a fatal accident near or on the railways is caused by risky behaviour,\" the operator said. \nThe SNCF said that last year about 10,000 trespassing incidents were recorded, including 23 fatalities and 11 serious injuries. It said this was a significant increase on previous years, without providing details.\nIn the UK, figures released by Network Rail and the British Transport Police for 2020 showed that November saw \"a staggering 75% increase in youth\" railway trespassing incidents, compared with the previous year.\nThe figures also showed an increase of such incidents by as much as 40% over the summer compared with 2019.

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to.\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could \"still cause some pressure to the health system\".\nHowever he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a \"slight gamble\" he thought it was \"justifiable\", adding \"I'm reasonably optimistic.\"\nHe said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. \"The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold.\"\nIn the worst-case scenario there \"may need to be a course correction later\", he added.\nBusinesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July.\nMelvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had \"got this right\", adding that \"the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen\". \nHe also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors.\nHowever, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still \"encourage guests\" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe."

      "text": "Gordon Lyons has been appointed to replace Paul Frew as NI economy minister, Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has announced.\nMr Frew had been appointed by Sir Jeffrey's predecessor Edwin Poots, who will remain as agriculture minister.\nSir Jeffrey said there would be a \"fundamental reshuffle\" in September.\nPaul Givan remains as first minister, with Michelle McIlveen continuing as education minister.\nSir Jeffrey became DUP leader last month after Mr Poots resigned 21 days into the role following an internal party row about the timing of Mr Givan's appointment.\nMr Poots had made sweeping changes to many of the DUP's positions, both at ministerial level and on assembly committees.\nIt followed his victory over Sir Jeffrey in the DUP's first leadership contest in its 50-year history.\nHowever, this came after the ousting of Arlene Foster which publicly exposed divisions in the party.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey said he was making \"limited\" changes to ministers and post-holders \"so as to minimise any impact personnel changes would have on the business of delivering for people across Northern Ireland\". \n\"I am mindful that our executive team, in conjunction with ministers from other parties, has further significant work to do in the next short period,\" he added.\n\"I do however intend to conduct a more fundamental reshuffle of posts in September.\"\nSir Jeffrey, who is the MP for Lagan Valley, has also indicated that at some stage he planned to return to the assembly and become first minister.\nIn an interview with UTV on Monday, he said he hoped to return to Stormont \"later this year\".\nMr Lyons, the assembly member (MLA) for East Antrim, has previously served as agriculture minister when he stood in for Edwin Poots on health grounds earlier this year.\nHe was also a junior minister in the executive office.\nIn a social media post he said he was \"delighted\" to be appointed.\nSir Jeffrey praised Mr Frew for \"progressing a number of important issues\" in the party over recent weeks, but said Mr Lyons was \"well-equipped to take on the role\" of economy minister.\n\"I know he will be focused on rebuilding and revitalising Northern Ireland's economy as we emerge from the Covid pandemic,\" he added."

      "text": "The Gates Foundation has outlined back-up plans in case its co-chairs cannot work together in the wake of their divorce.\nThe deal gives Bill and Melinda Gates a two-year trial, after which Ms Gates could resign from the organisation.\nUnder the agreement, Ms Gates would also receive \"personal resources\" from her ex-husband for her own charity work.\nMs Gates said she was \"deeply proud\" of what the organisation has achieved.\nIn a statement, she added: \"I believe deeply in the foundation's mission and remain fully committed as co-chair to its work.\"\nThe agreement comes after question marks were raised over the future of the organisation when the couple announced they were divorcing after 27 years of marriage in May.\nThe billionaires run the charitable foundation, which has worked on initiatives such as fighting infectious diseases and encouraging vaccinations for children.\nMs Gates will remain as a trustee during the \"trial period\", although it was announced in a blog post on Wednesday that the foundation will recruit new trustees to oversee its work. \nIts chief executive Mark Suzman said the successful candidates will be announced in January next year.\nHe added that any funds received by Ms Gates in the event of her resignation would be \"completely separate from the foundation's endowment, which would not be affected\".\nThe announcement also follows on from billionaire investor Warren Buffett's recent decision to step back from the foundation's board.\nHe previously said his \"physical participation is in no way needed\" for the foundation to achieve its goals.\nMr Buffett is a co-founder of the Giving Pledge, along with Bill and Melinda Gates, which is a campaign that encourages billionaire philanthropy.\nIn a note to Gates Foundation staff on Tuesday, it was announced that the couple would be donating another $15bn (\u00a310.9bn) of their personal wealth to the foundation.\nBoth Mr and Ms Gates do, however, have other charitable funds, focused on green energy and women's causes respectively.
