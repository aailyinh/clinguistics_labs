      "title": "Call for five-year delay in all-lane smart motorways",
      "tags": "Highways England,Department for Transport,Road safety",
      "text": "The introduction of \"all-lane\" smart motorways should be halted until their safety can be ensured, MPs have warned.\nThe schemes use the hard shoulder as a permanent live traffic lane to increase capacity - but critics say this has contributed to deaths on the roads. \nIn a report, the Commons' Transport Select Committee said there was not enough safety and economic data to justify continuing with the plans. \nThe Department for Transport said it would consider the recommendations. \nHowever, the report did not recommend reinstating hard shoulders where they have been removed.\nClaire Mercer, whose husband Jason was killed on a stretch of smart motorway near Sheffield in 2019, wants that to happen and said the report's recommendations did not \"go far enough\".\nSmart motorways, which use technology to maintain the flow of traffic and give information on overhead displays, have existed in England since 2002.\nThere are three types - the all-lane-running version, which involves opening the hard shoulder permanently to drivers, began in 2014.\nThe other types are controlled motorways, which have three or more lanes, variable speed limits and a hard shoulder for emergency use, and dynamic hard shoulder motorways, which have variable speed limits and a hard shoulder that can be opened up to traffic at busy times.\nThere are about 375 miles of smart motorway in England, including 235 miles without a hard shoulder. \nAccording to government figures obtained by Panorama in 2020, 38 people were killed on smart motorways between 2014 and 2019.\nMrs Mercer's husband Jason was killed when he and another driver stopped in a live lane of an all lane running motorway following a minor collision and were hit by a lorry. \nMrs Mercer said: \"We need the hard shoulder because everything that they have tried to substitute it with doesn't work.\n\"The hard shoulder was just there, it didn't rely on software, it didn't rely on humans, it was just there and you could use it when you needed it.\"\nIn a nutshell, this report is saying wait, don't get rid of more hard shoulders, but don't put them back either. \nThe argument has been intensifying between campaigners and the government. \nThe Transport Select Committee argues that the existing data can be cut both ways so the best option is to improve safety on the ones already built and wait for five years so the data is more reliable. \nThat hasn't been well received by campaigners who argue that any delay could lead to more deaths. \nThere are currently plenty of works under way to convert the hard shoulder on other motorways too and the government is under no obligation to follow these recommendations. \nBut the hope from the committee is that they've offered a pragmatic approach that might be more appealing to the government. \nThe committee's report said: \"The government and National Highways should pause the rollout of new all-lane running schemes until five years of safety and economic data is available for every all-lane running scheme introduced before 2020 and the implementation of the safety improvements in the government's action plan has been independently evaluated.\"\nIt described the government's decision in March 2020 that all future smart motorways would be all-lane-running versions as \"premature\".\nDemonstrators protesting against smart motorways marched with coffins to the Houses of Parliament on Monday. \nRelatives of those killed on smart motorways have called for the hard shoulder to be permanently reinstalled after a number of incidents in which broken-down vehicles were hit from behind. \nHowever, the committee said it was \"not convinced\" that such a policy would boost safety. \nIt concluded: \"The evidence suggests that doing so could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury\" as motorway capacity would be reduced.\nIt said: \"If that traffic were diverted on to A-roads, it might result in an extra 25 deaths and 224 serious casualties per year.\"\nThe committee pointed out that controlled motorways, which retain the hard shoulder and have technology to regulate traffic, have the lowest casualty rates of all types of motorway on the network. \nIt said: \"The Department and National Highways should revisit the case for controlled motorways.\"\nResponding to the report, Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said the government must listen to victims' families.\n\"We know smart motorways in their current form, coupled with inadequate safety systems, are not fit for purpose and are putting lives at risk,\" he said.\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We're pleased that the TSC (Transport Select Committee) recognises that reinstating the hard shoulder on all all-lane running motorways could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury and that we're right to focus on upgrading their safety.\""

      "tags": "China,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. \nExperts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change.\nIn 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. \nHis statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow.\nBut China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  \nWhile all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. \nPer person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. \nChina became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. \nAlong with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C.\nChina strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".  \nGetting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift.\nCoal has been the country's main source of energy for decades.\nPresident Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will not build new coal-fired projects abroad - but some governments and campaigners say the plans are not going far enough. \nResearchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing say China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. \nAnd far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant.\nNew stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   \nIt may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. \nChina argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty.\nIn the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to increase production to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks.\nTsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050.\nIn moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. \nChina first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. \nBut the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas.\n\"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\" \nChina generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading.\nChina's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020.\nChina says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. \nChina ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. \nCurrently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered.\nBy 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid.\nWorking out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. \nBut studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. \nThis matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with road vehicles being the largest emitters. \nChina will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined.\nObservers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale.\nGetting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions.\nIt means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches.\nIncreasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide.\nHere again, there is encouraging news. China is getting greener at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution.\nIt is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. \nThe world needs China to succeed. \n\"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre.\nChina has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  \nThe Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important."

      "text": "A four-year-old girl missing for 18 days in a remote part of Western Australia has been found alive and well in a locked house, police have said.\nCleo Smith disappeared from her family's tent at a campsite near the town of Carnarvon on 16 October, triggering a massive search.\nA 36-year-old man is in custody and being questioned by detectives.\nPolice smashed their way into a home in Carnarvon in the early hours of Wednesday, following forensic clues.\n\"They found little Cleo in one of the rooms,\" Deputy Commissioner Col Blanch from WA Police said in a statement.\n\"One of the officers picked her up into his arms and asked her, 'What's your name?' She said 'My name is Cleo'.\"\nThe girl has been reunited with her parents, who had made desperate pleas for Cleo's return.\n\"Our family is whole again,\" her mother, Ellie Smith, wrote on Instagram.\nPolice footage of Cleo's rescue showed her \"smiling\" and \"as well as we could expect in the circumstances\", said Commissioner Chris Dawson, who added she was receiving medical care.\nAuthorities say the man in custody has no connection to the Smith family. No charges have been laid.\nThe house where Cleo was found is about six minutes' drive from her family home in Carnarvon, which has about 5,000 residents.\nAustralian PM Scott Morrison tweeted it was \"wonderful, relieving news\". Commissioner Dawson said: \"I think Australia is rejoicing.\"\n\"To find a little girl - a vulnerable little girl - after 18 days. You know, obviously people think the worst, but importantly hope was never lost,\" the commissioner added.\nCleo's family were on the first night of their holiday at the Quobba Blowholes camping ground when she went missing between 01:30 and 06:00 on 16 October.\nThe remote site in Macleod is about 900km (560 miles) north of Perth, and is a local attraction on the state's Coral Coast - known for its windswept ocean scenery, sea caves and lagoons.\nCleo had been sleeping on an air mattress next to her younger sister's cot. When her mother, who had been sleeping in the second room of the tent, got up in the morning, Cleo was gone and the tent door was open.\nPolice said this raised fears of an abduction. Ms Smith was adamant Cleo could not have left the tent on her own.\nA taskforce of 100 officers were sent in from the state capital, Perth, to join a massive air, land and sea search. Reconnaissance planes were used to comb sparsely populated areas.\nAuthorities offered a A$1m ($750,000; \u00a3540,000) reward for information on Cleo's whereabouts.\nThe case drew international attention, and there were reports that bounty hunters had travelled to the region once the cash reward had been offered.\nDeputy Commissioner Blanch said they scoured thousands of pieces of information looking for a \"needle in a haystack\".\n\"Late last night they found that needle that led them to that address and rescued Cleo,\" he told Network Seven.\nPolice said it involved information about a car, but would not elaborate.\nABC News reported a man who lived at the house had been recently spotted by a neighbour buying nappies.\n\"We didn't click who\u2026 he was buying them for,\" the neighbour was quoted as saying.\nNews that Cleo has been found sparked a sense of huge relief in the local community.\n\"For 18 days we've been filled with anxiety and concern,\" Carnarvon Shire president Eddie Smith told Australia's 2GB radio.\nDeputy Commissioner Blanch told 6PR radio that it had been \"incredible to see seasoned detectives openly crying with relief\".\nPolice said they did not expect the reward to be claimed."

      "text": "Roblox has issued an apology to the millions of fans who were unable to get online over the last three days. \nThe game platform and creation system suffered a blackout after the outage, which began on Thursday. \nOn Sunday the company said the outage had been caused by a \"bug\".\nRoblox said the issue took longer to fix than \"any of us would have liked\", echoing complaints from millions of its players who took to social media during the lengthy downtime.\n\"We are sorry for the length of time it took us to restore service,\" David Baszucki, Roblox's founder and CEO, said in a blog post.\nMr Baszucki said \"a subtle bug\" - while systems were under heavy load - was responsible. \n\"This was not due to any peak in external traffic or any particular experience,\" he said, but rather a growth in the number of servers the company uses.\nSome players had initially speculated the problems had been caused by a spike in traffic due to the popularity of a burrito promotion from a fast-food chain, which had encouraged players to visit its in-game restaurant. That theory was dismissed when Roblox said the problems were not down to a surge in traffic.\nOn Sunday, the restaurant tweeted an image of a cashier at the in-game eatery with a sign reading: \"Pls don't yell at me. The burrito is innocent\".\nRoblox said it first noticed users were having trouble connecting to the game on 28 October: \"This immediately became our highest priority\", it said.\n\"Teams began working around the clock to identify the source of the problem and get things back to normal.\"\nThe problem persisted for nearly three days. The company said it will conduct a post-mortem to help avoid a similar situation in the future.\nSince the coronavirus pandemic closed schools and kept children at home, the popularity of the platform surged. Since March 2020, 50 million new users joined the game, and there are now more than 42 million active daily users. The majority of them are under 16. \nThe entire platform is made up of user-generated games, many of them created by teenagers, some of whom have made significant sums of money from the platform."

      "text": "The Queen has urged world leaders at the COP26 climate summit to \"achieve true statesmanship\" and create a \"safer, stabler future\" for the planet.\nIn a video message, she said many people hoped the \"time for words has now moved to the time for action\". \nShe urged them to act \"for our children and our children's children\" and \"rise above the politics of the moment\".\nThe Queen added she took \"great pride\" in how her \"dear late husband\" Prince Philip promoted environmental issues.\nThe 95-year-old monarch had been scheduled to attend the United Nations conference in Glasgow. But she pre-recorded her address last week at Windsor Castle after being advised to rest following medical checks.\nThe Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge are both attending the COP26 conference, which is seen as a crucial gathering if temperature increases and climate changes are to be limited.\nIn her address, the Queen recalled how the \"impact of the environment on human progress was a subject close to the heart\" of the Duke of Edinburgh. She referred to his warning at a 1969 academic gathering of the dangers of failing to address pollution.\nThe Queen said: \"It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William.  \n\"I could not be more proud of them.\"\nEven though not there in person, this was a surprisingly personal message from the Queen.\nShe mentions how the environment was a subject close to the heart of \"my dear late husband\" Prince Philip and says she \"could not be more proud\" that it was an interest sustained by her son Charles and grandson William.\nShe also seems to make reference to her own mortality: \"None of us will live forever.\"\nBut there is also the authoritative voice of someone looking back after almost 70 years as head of state, telling world leaders to take the long view and \"rise above the politics of the moment\".\nThe Queen says \"statesmanship\" means serving the future rather than short-term political rewards.\nShe might be on the video screen but she was telling world leaders to focus on the big picture.\nThe Queen said she also drew \"great comfort and inspiration from the relentless enthusiasm of people of all ages - especially the young - in calling for everyone to play their part\".\nShe said: \"In the coming days, the world has the chance to join in the shared objective of creating a safer, stabler future for our people and for the planet on which we depend. \n\"None of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope.\"\nIn other developments at COP26:\nThe Queen said she hoped the leaders at COP26 would \"rise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship\".  \nShe added: \"It is the hope of many that the legacy of this summit - written in history books yet to be printed - will describe you as the leaders who did not pass up the opportunity; and that you answered the call of those future generations.\n\"That you left this conference as a community of nations with a determination, a desire, and a plan, to address the impact of climate change; and to recognise that the time for words has now moved to the time for action.\n\"Of course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: we none of us will live forever. \n\"But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, and those who will follow in their footsteps.\" \nAhead of COP26, the Queen was overheard appearing to suggest she was irritated by people who \"talk\" but \"don't do\", when it comes to climate issues.\nAddressing the opening of the conference earlier in the day, the Prince of Wales urged world leaders into action, saying he understood that many countries could not afford to \"go green\".\nInstead, he said, there needs to be a \"vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector\", which had trillions of dollars at its disposal.\n\"The scale and scope of the threat we face call for a global, systems-level solution, based on radically transforming our current fossil fuel-based economy to one that is genuinely renewable and sustainable,\" he said.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

He died and one of the people he hit was fatally injured.\nThe third person was left with non-life threatening injuries and was taken to hospital.\nNone of the victims have been named by police but the man who fell was said by police to be in his 80s and the other man in his 60s.\n\"We received a call about someone having either jumped or fallen from a high altitude,\" police spokesman Magnus Jansson Klarin told the AFP news agency. \nHe said officers were working to establish what exactly had happened, adding that it was too early to say whether a crime had occurred.\nThe concert hall was initially closed by police so witnesses at the scene could be questioned.\nMTLive, the events company that organised the show, wrote on their Facebook page that \"everyone is in shock\".\n\"Unfortunately, we have to announce that a terrible event has happened. What we know is that someone jumped [or] fell high in the arena and hit other people,\" the company said. \n\"Right now we don't know much more, everyone is in shock,\" it added.\nThe tragic incident comes just days before Abba are due to release their first new album in more than 40 years on Friday.

      "tags": "Highways England,Department for Transport,Road safety",
      "text": "The introduction of \"all-lane\" smart motorways should be halted until their safety can be ensured, MPs have warned.\nThe schemes use the hard shoulder as a permanent live traffic lane to increase capacity - but critics say this has contributed to deaths on the roads. \nIn a report, the Commons' Transport Select Committee said there was not enough safety and economic data to justify continuing with the plans. \nThe Department for Transport said it would consider the recommendations. \nHowever, the report did not recommend reinstating hard shoulders where they have been removed.\nClaire Mercer, whose husband Jason was killed on a stretch of smart motorway near Sheffield in 2019, wants that to happen and said the report's recommendations did not \"go far enough\".\nSmart motorways, which use technology to maintain the flow of traffic and give information on overhead displays, have existed in England since 2002.\nThere are three types - the all-lane-running version, which involves opening the hard shoulder permanently to drivers, began in 2014.\nThe other types are controlled motorways, which have three or more lanes, variable speed limits and a hard shoulder for emergency use, and dynamic hard shoulder motorways, which have variable speed limits and a hard shoulder that can be opened up to traffic at busy times.\nThere are about 375 miles of smart motorway in England, including 235 miles without a hard shoulder. \nAccording to government figures obtained by Panorama in 2020, 38 people were killed on smart motorways between 2014 and 2019.\nMrs Mercer's husband Jason was killed when he and another driver stopped in a live lane of an all lane running motorway following a minor collision and were hit by a lorry. \nMrs Mercer said: \"We need the hard shoulder because everything that they have tried to substitute it with doesn't work.\n\"The hard shoulder was just there, it didn't rely on software, it didn't rely on humans, it was just there and you could use it when you needed it.\"\nIn a nutshell, this report is saying wait, don't get rid of more hard shoulders, but don't put them back either. \nThe argument has been intensifying between campaigners and the government. \nThe Transport Select Committee argues that the existing data can be cut both ways so the best option is to improve safety on the ones already built and wait for five years so the data is more reliable. \nThat hasn't been well received by campaigners who argue that any delay could lead to more deaths. \nThere are currently plenty of works under way to convert the hard shoulder on other motorways too and the government is under no obligation to follow these recommendations. \nBut the hope from the committee is that they've offered a pragmatic approach that might be more appealing to the government. \nThe committee's report said: \"The government and National Highways should pause the rollout of new all-lane running schemes until five years of safety and economic data is available for every all-lane running scheme introduced before 2020 and the implementation of the safety improvements in the government's action plan has been independently evaluated.\"\nIt described the government's decision in March 2020 that all future smart motorways would be all-lane-running versions as \"premature\".\nDemonstrators protesting against smart motorways marched with coffins to the Houses of Parliament on Monday. \nRelatives of those killed on smart motorways have called for the hard shoulder to be permanently reinstalled after a number of incidents in which broken-down vehicles were hit from behind. \nHowever, the committee said it was \"not convinced\" that such a policy would boost safety. \nIt concluded: \"The evidence suggests that doing so could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury\" as motorway capacity would be reduced.\nIt said: \"If that traffic were diverted on to A-roads, it might result in an extra 25 deaths and 224 serious casualties per year.\"\nThe committee pointed out that controlled motorways, which retain the hard shoulder and have technology to regulate traffic, have the lowest casualty rates of all types of motorway on the network. \nIt said: \"The Department and National Highways should revisit the case for controlled motorways.\"\nResponding to the report, Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said the government must listen to victims' families.\n\"We know smart motorways in their current form, coupled with inadequate safety systems, are not fit for purpose and are putting lives at risk,\" he said.\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We're pleased that the TSC (Transport Select Committee) recognises that reinstating the hard shoulder on all all-lane running motorways could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury and that we're right to focus on upgrading their safety.\""

      "text": "A digital token inspired by the popular South Korean Netflix series Squid Game has lost almost all of its value as it was revealed to be an apparent scam.\nSquid, which marketed itself as a \"play-to-earn cryptocurrency\", had seen its price soar in recent days - surging by thousands of per cent.\nHowever, as the BBC reported, it was criticised for not allowing people to resell their tokens.\nThis kind of scam is commonly called a \"rug pull\" by crypto investors.\nThis happens when the promoter of a digital token draws in buyers, stops trading activity and makes off with the money raised from sales.\nSquid's developers have made off with an estimated $3.38m (\u00a32.48m), according to technology website Gizmodo.\n\"Play-to-earn\" cryptocurrency is where people buy tokens to use in online games and can earn more tokens which can later be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or national currencies.\nLast Tuesday, Squid was trading at just 1 cent. In less than a week its price had jumped to over $2,856.\nIts value has now plummeted by 99.99%, said cryptocurrency data website CoinMarketCap.\nSquid was billed as a token that could be used for a new online game inspired by the Netflix series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money. The game was due to go live this month.\nHowever, cryptocurrency experts had warned of several tell-tale signs that it was likely to be a scam.\nMost telling was that people who bought Squid tokens were unable to sell them.\nCritics also highlighted that its website contained many spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. The website is no longer online and social media accounts promoting the tokens have also vanished.\n\"It is one of many schemes by which na\u00efve retail investors are drawn in and exploited by malevolent crypto promoters,\" Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad told the BBC. \nProfessor Prasad said buyers need to be aware when buying cryptocurrencies as there is almost no regulatory oversight. \n\"In fact, open pump and dump schemes are rampant in the crypto world, with investors often jumping in with eyes wide open, perhaps hoping that they can ride the wave and dump their holdings for a quick profit before prices collapse,\" he said. \nSquid was available for sale on decentralised crypto exchanges including PancakeSwap and DODO, which allows for buyers to connect directly to sellers, without a central authority. \n\"Nowadays new coins can be listed on decentralised exchanges on the first day they are created, without any regulation or due diligence,\" said Jinnan Ouyang from Singapore-based crypto company Openmining. \n\"So you could be buying coins from anyone with any agenda.\""

      "tags": "Policing,Catholicism,Police Service of Northern Ireland",
      "text": "New figures have revealed the ongoing problems the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has in hiring more officers from a Catholic background.\nOf 193 officers recruited in 2020, 75% (144) were Protestant and 24% (46) were Catholic.\nIt comes as the PSNI launches a new recruitment drive in the week that marks 20 years since it was established.\nOne of its priorities has been increasing Catholic officer numbers.\nThe PSNI is hoping to hire 400 student officers from its latest recruitment campaign.\nIn 2001, under policing reforms, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), which was overwhelmingly Protestant, was renamed the PSNI.\nOne of the aims was to build broader community support and increase Catholic officers.\nFor that reason, it regularly publishes figures on the perceived religious background of applicants and officers.\nLegislation, which ran for a decade until 2011, saw Catholic officer numbers increase fourfold - they now make up 32% of the service's 7,000 officers.\nBut since the legislation ended the increase has stalled and there have been warnings numbers could begin to fall back.\nUnionist parties do not support its re-introduction.\nWhen the 2020 recruitment campaign launched, Sinn F\u00e9in politicians attended for the first time.\nIn terms of applications, 66% were from those of a perceived Protestant background, 31% Catholic and the remainder were undetermined.\nBut when it came to appointees, 75% were Protestant and 24% Catholic - though recruitment is said to be \"ongoing\".\nThe PSNI has remarked upon this issue previously and pointed out that Catholic applicants can drop out as a result, for example, of the prospect of having to leave the community they grew up in.\nSinn F\u00e9in's policing board member Gerry Kelly said there had been change within the PSNI.\n\"People have come to me for assistance to join the PSNI and I have given them every assistance I possibly can,\" said the North Belfast assembly member.\nHowever, Mr Kelly said he could not tie himself \"to every act the PSNI do\", adding the \"biggest issue\" facing the force was how to deal with legacy.\nMervyn Storey, chair of Stormont's justice committee, said he believed people \"from all sections of our community\" should be encouraged to join the police service.\n\"What we want to see is not political interference, it is effective, efficient policing so that whether you're in a loyalist community or a nationalist republican community, or whatever community you're in, you'll know that if you break the law there'll be a police service that will do all in their power to apprehend you,\" said the DUP assembly member.\nSDLP policing board member Dolores Kelly said her party had \"always encouraged Catholics to consider a career in the PSNI\".\n\"Despite attempts from some narrow-minded elements in our communities to dissuade Catholics from considering a career in policing it is a vocation to be proud of,\" said the Upper Bann MLA.\nLord Patten, who was chair of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland which delivered the recommendations on police reform, said that in \"structural terms\" the proposal of 50-50 recruitment, which ran until 2011, was probably the most innovative.\n\"It was difficult as we sold our vision of policing to persuade some elements in both cultures, in both sides of the community, to accept that they had to change as well - it wasn't just a question of policing change,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.\n\"It was important to persuade for example people in the republican/nationalist community that if they wanted to be police officers they should be doing their policing in Northern Ireland, not elsewhere, because there was no shortage of Northern Ireland recruits in policing in Glasgow, London, Birmingham, Manchester - they just weren't joining the police service in Northern Ireland.\n\"We thought that was something that had to change and it was important that the Catholic Church was as open as possible to the idea, as well as the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association).\"\nDeputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told Good Morning Ulster \"there are still issues in communities about how people feel about the police in both sides\".\nHowever, Mr Hamilton said there are \"huge differences\" between the RUC and the PSNI.\n\"There are so many things that are different for constables joining now, we are more visible, whenever I was a constable we very rarely drove around in a marked police car, now most of our police cars are marked,\" he said.\nAhead of the new recruitment campaign, Acting Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton said: \"There is a role for wider society in terms of showing support to people who want to take that step and serve their communities.\n\"We want policing to be a career for everybody. We want it to be a reflection of our society.\"\nThe dissident republican threat against PSNI officers and how the organisation handles troubles legacy issues are both seen as factors which can affect Catholic recruitment.\nThe PSNI also faces challenges improving the number of officers from an ethnic minority background (currently below 1%) and the number of women in senior positions."

      "tags": "Companies,Global supply chain management,COP26,Climate change,Shipping industry,Freight transport",
      "text": "Christmas trading will be safe from supply chain problems, the boss of shipping firm Maersk has told the BBC - adding, \"at least that's what I'm hearing from our customers\".\nThe company handles almost 20% of the world's shipping containers.\nChief executive Soren Skou, said the firm is chartering more ships, keeping ports open longer and has opened more warehouses to help.\nThe firm is doing \"everything\" it can to alleviate the problems, he said. \nThere have been recent warnings in the UK and the US that logjams at ports will lead to shortages at Christmas.\nMr Skou said that a shortage of workers in the ports to unload ships and a lack of truckers was behind the problems. \nA Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. There are also shortages across Europe and the US.\nMr Skou estimated that approximately 300 large container ships around the world are sitting waiting outside ports. Almost 80 of these, he added, were in Los Angeles, with a \"few\" outside Felixstowe and others stuck by Chinese ports including Shanghai and Ningbo.\nThis widespread congestion was triggered by a collapse in demand during the early stages of the pandemic. That was followed by a period of frantic activity, as people who were forced to stay at home rather than travel or socialise, ordered large quantities of consumer goods.\nMr Skou, who runs the world's biggest shipping firm, said this shows no sign of easing: \"The reality is that consumer demand is strong and at the same time our customers inventories are low.\"\n\"They both need to serve the consumer here and now, but also rebuild inventories and that's why we have an unprecedented demand situation\".\nThe demand has meant Maersk and other shipping companies have been able to charge record prices. The Danish company's pre-tax profits rose fivefold to $5.9bn for the July to September period.\nLast week Japanese cargo line Ocean Network Express reported a more than eight fold jump in profits for the same period, to $4.2bn. \nOne of UK's biggest toy retailers, The Entertainer, recently warned delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. \nIn the US, the port of Los Angeles has started operating 24 hours a day to clear a backlog of cargo ships which has led to shortages. White House officials warned that there \"will be things that people can't get\" during the holiday season, despite President Biden appointing a bottlenecks Czar. \nSimon Heaney of the maritime research firm Drewry, said Maersk's mitigations might not be enough. Mr Heaney explained that \"port congestion is worsening while the number of ships waiting outside major ports around the world is increasing\".\nThe brief closure of some big container terminals due to China's coronavirus restrictions, extreme weather events and a rise in the Delta variant of coronavirus, are each playing a part Mr Heaney said. \nMr Heaney added that opening ports for longer won't help if there aren't enough staff to run them.\n90% of global trade is moved by sea and with demand having shown no sign of easing, the shipping industry is looking to tackle its impact on climate change.\nIt's responsible for about 2% of carbon emissions, meaning that if the industry was a country it would be the sixth biggest polluter, above Germany.\nThe UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is aiming for a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.\nAs world leaders meet to tackle climate change in Glasgow Mr Skou was critical of the targets set by the UN body that oversees his industry: \"The ambition level at the IMO so far has been quite limited\". \n\"We as Maersk certainly are pushing hard for that to be reducing by 100% in 2050 and we believe it can be done\".\nOn Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"We urge the IMO to take action to set ambitious targets to achieve zero emission shipping by 2050\". \n\"Carbon-neutral shipping is vital to reaching our climate goals,\" he added. Shipping was not included in the Paris climate agreement.\nThe International Chamber of Shipping has backed a $5bn fund to develop carbon free shipping and overcome a lack of investment in the technology required. Maersk plans to launch the world's first carbon neutral cargo ship in 2023.\nHowever, Mr Skou said the slow progress doesn't mean we need to move fewer goods around the world to tackle climate change. \n\"I think we just have to get to the point that we can use different fuels,\" he added.

      "text": "Investigators say \"low adhesion\" between the track and train wheels was the most likely cause of the crash between two trains in Salisbury.\nThe trains collided on the approach to a tunnel near Salisbury station at about 18:45 GMT on Sunday.\nOne of the drivers is believed to have suffered \"life-changing\" injuries. \nInvestigators say the GWR train was \"protected by a red signal\" before being hit by a South Western train.\nAndrew Hall, from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, said the South Western train was \"required to stop\" but \"it did not stop\".\nInitial evidence was that the driver did attempt to brake at a red signal before the train suffered \"wheel slide\".\n\"Unfortunately, it did not stop and struck the side of the Great Western train at an angle such that both trains derailed and ran alongside each other into the tunnel.\n\"We are continuing to pursue this as a line of investigation amongst others,\" he added.\nThe Rail Delivery Group said low adhesion can be caused by \"moisture on the rail mixing with the film produced by 'leaves on the line' or other contaminants, such as rust or grease.\"\nThey add the problem can be worse in autumn and that \"it can also cause safety risks, such as signals passed at danger and station overruns\".\nMr Hall said the initial results of the investigation would be made public later in the week.\nThe crash has caused major disruption, with lines through the city expected to remain closed until at least the end of Monday.\nOf the 92 passengers on board the two trains, 14 required hospital treatment for minor injuries. \nThe South Western Railway (SWR) train was running from London to Honiton, Devon, while the Great Western Railway (GWR) service was travelling from from Southampton to Cardiff as they both collided at Fisherton Tunnel.\nBoth trains had passed a Y-shaped junction, close to the entrance of the tunnel, before the collision.\nMartin Frobisher, Network Rail's safety and engineering director, said: \"Sunday's accident was incredibly frightening for everyone involved and our thoughts are with everyone injured or affected in any way.\n\"Initial findings suggest that low adhesion played a key part in causing the collision.\n\"It's an issue that affects railways across the world and is something that we, and our train operator colleagues, work hard to combat - so that we can run trains safely and reliably throughout autumn, and why incidents such as the one in Salisbury at the weekend are incredibly rare.\"\nTransport minister Chris Heaton-Harris paid tribute to those injured in the crash.\n\"There are plenty of lessons I am sure that will be learned but we are at the very early stages of the investigation,\" he added.\nWiltshire Police deputy chief constable Paul Mills said: \"Although thankfully no-one lost their lives, it is hard to imagine the shock and distress this incident would have had caused those onboard both trains.\"\nSWR and GWR are offering alternative train services and rail replacement buses, but people are being advised not to travel on that part of the network until the lines have fully reopened.\nSalisbury MP John Glen said the closure of the line was \"hugely disruptive\" and his thoughts were with the driver and all those affected.\n\"It was obviously a shocking event and one doesn't expect this sort of thing to happen. \n\"It's a key line and there's a significant commuting population, and this disruption is hugely damaging to people's lives.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "The life of a teenager who can have hundreds of epileptic seizures a day \"hangs in the balance\" without cannabis treatment, his parents say.\nBailey Williams' parents say getting the \u00a31,200 needed each month has become harder during the pandemic.\nWithout the drug they fear the 19-year-old's body may need to be \"shut down\" in hospital to control his condition.\nThe Welsh government said doctors must take account of evidence and guidelines before prescribing.\nBailey's parents Craig Williams and Rachel Rankmore are part of a group presenting a petition to Downing Street later, which is calling for an emergency compassionate fund for patients like Bailey.\nThey want both UK and Welsh governments to act.\nCampaigners say they have gathered more than 600,000 signatures.\nThe UK government changed the law in 2018 to make prescribing medical cannabis legal.\nBut pressure group End Our Pain says only three such prescriptions have since been made on the NHS, with many families forced to go private.\nMr Williams and Ms Rankmore, from Cardiff, said they had encountered reluctance to prescribe on the NHS and have had to use a doctor in London who is willing to do so privately.\n\"If Bailey had to come off his medication now because we could not afford it, the only other treatment available to him would be palliative care,\" said Ms Rankmore.\n\"They would take him into hospital and shut down his body to try and stop the seizures.\n\"He has tried every other drug.\"\nMr Williams explained the cannabis-based medicine had been life-changing and prevented his son from having hundreds of seizures a day.\n\"Bailey has been on this medicine now for five-and-a-half years, and in five-and-a-half years we have not had an ambulance visit,\" he said.\n\"In five-and-a-half years we have not had an overnight stay in hospital, and yet they seem to say, for whatever reason, that there is no proof that it is working.\"\nSome doctors still have doubts about the effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based medicine, despite it now being legal.\nIn March 2021, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clarified its guidance to say health professionals could consider the products \"where clinically appropriate in an individual case\".\nCardiff and Vale health board passed on queries about its policies to the Welsh government.\nThe Welsh government said cannabis-based Epidyolex was routinely available for \"some forms of severe refractory epilepsy\". \nA spokesman said: \"We expect healthcare professionals to take account of all evidence and recognised guidelines before prescribing.\n\"The decision to prescribe unlicensed cannabis-based medicinal products is for individual prescribers in consultation with the patient, their families, carers or guardian; the primary concern of doctors will always be to ensure the safety of their patients. \n\"Where an NHS healthcare professional wishes to prescribe these products arrangements are in place for the NHS to consider and where appropriate meet their cost.\""

      "text": "Morrisons has backed down after customers complained about its labelling of a chicken meat product as containing \"non-EU salt and pepper\".\nThe supermarket chain's salt-and-pepper chicken crown features the Union Flag on its label, which says that it is \"made from British chicken\".\nThe label provoked an angry reaction on Twitter, including one accusation of stoking \"anti-EU hatred\".\nIn response, the firm said the wording was \"an error for which we apologise\".\n\"We are changing the packaging immediately,\" its tweet added.\nA spokesman for Morrisons said: \"It is adhering to packaging regulations rather than making any political point.\"\nThe supermarket said it would change the packaging and de-emphasise the mention of non-EU salt and pepper, but said it would still have to be included somewhere on the wrapping because of packaging laws.\nAccording to government guidance on food labelling, the term \"non-EU\" must be used on meat packaging when full country information is unavailable.\nFrom October next year, following post-Brexit rule changes, this will be replaced by \"non-UK\".\nAmong the reactions from customers, some pointed out the irony of a soon-to-be US-owned supermarket displaying its British credentials.\nLast month, Morrisons shareholders approved a multi-billion pound takeover offer from US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R).\nOthers poked fun at the wording in other ways, with one person tweeting: \"I've just had a look at my salt and pepper and it has no country of origin on it. It's from Aldi... \n\"Does that mean it's non-EU or not? Is it safe to put it on an English chicken? Asking for Morrisons...\"\nOne customer raised the issue of food miles, saying: \"In other words, they get their S&P from somewhere further away, creating more impact on the climate.\"\nAnother queried how useful such information was for shoppers, tweeting: \"Aside from anything else, I'd have thought most normal people want to know where foodstuff IS from, not where it isn't.\"\nThe move comes in the midst of a debate in the food retailing industry about firms' increasing tendency to use patriotic imagery on packaging, with trade publication The Grocer identifying it as part of a post-Brexit \"culture war\".\nHowever, those who support the trend see the \"made in the UK\" tag as a sign of quality rather than a political statement."

      "text": "Facebook has announced it will no longer use facial recognition software to identify faces in photographs and videos.\nThere have been growing concerns about the ethics of facial recognition technology, with questions raised over privacy, racial bias, and accuracy.\nRegulators had not yet provided a clear set of rules over how it should be used, the company said.\nIt has faced a barrage of criticism over its impact on its users.\nUntil now, users of the social media app could choose to opt in to the feature which would scan their face in pictures and notify them if someone else on the platform had posted a picture of them.\nIn a blog post, Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at the firm said: \"Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.\"\nIn 2019, a US government study suggested facial recognition algorithms were far less accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces. \nAfrican-American women were even more likely to be misidentified, according to the study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nLast year, Facebook also settled a long-running legal dispute about the way it scans and tags photos. \nThe case has been ongoing since 2015, and it was agreed the firm would pay $550m (\u00a3421m) to a group of users in Illinois who argued its facial recognition tool was in violation of the state's privacy laws.\nOther tech firms such as Amazon and Microsoft have both suspended facial recognition product sales to police as the uses for the technology have become more controversial. \nFacebook, which as well as running the world's largest social media network also owns Instagram and the messaging service Whatsapp, has come under growing pressure from regulators and politicians.\nIt is facing increased scrutiny from regulators including the US the Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.\nAnd last month, a former employee accused the company of unethical behaviour. Frances Haugen released a cache of internal documents which she said showed Facebook had put profit before user safety.\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerburg said Ms Haugen's claims were part of a co-ordinated effort to \"paint a false picture\" of the company.\nThe firm recently announced a new name, Meta, for the broader parent company following a series of negative stories about Facebook.\nMr Zuckerberg said the existing brand could not \"possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future\" and needed to change."

      "text": "Tributes have been paid to one of three paddleboarders who died after a group of nine got into difficulty in a river.\nPaul O'Dwyer was described as \"the life and soul of the party\" who devoted much of his time to charities.\nHe and two women died, and another woman is critically ill, after the group got into difficulty on the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, on Saturday morning.\nPolice said the river was high and fast after heavy rain just beforehand.\nThe other five adults on the paddleboarding excursion were rescued uninjured. A member of the public who went into the water to help was also unhurt.\nDyfed-Powys Police are carrying out a \"thorough investigation\", and urged other paddleboarders to ensure they understand the weather and water conditions before going out.\nNone of those who died or were involved have been officially named yet.\nBut Neath Port Talbot councillor Matthew Crowley knew Mr O'Dwyer for most of his life, and said he had always been a sports lover, and was the \"life and soul of the party, from a real young age\".\n\"He immersed himself into surfing, paddleboarding, skiing, anything to do with water.\n\"He comes from a great family background. A real good moral compass.\"\nMr Crowley is also the president of Aberavon Green Stars rugby club, which Mr O'Dwyer, from Port Talbot, also joined.\n\"He became a formidable player. He played for eight or 10 seasons at a pretty good level. He was a great player and embraced the club.\"\nHe added: \"Paul immersed so much of his time and energy into charities. Whenever there was a charity event Paul would be the first one in fancy dress, he'd be the first one with a ra-ra skirt on. \n\"He loved all that... helping people and raising a few pound for good, worthwhile causes in the community.\" \nThose involved are said to have been a part of the South Wales Paddle Boarders and Salty Dog Co, an organisation based in Port Talbot, according to PA Media.\nOne woman told the news agency that she had pulled out of the paddle on the morning of the incident as she was concerned about the weather conditions.\nVickie Mckinven, from Milford Haven, said the incident was \"absolutely heart-breaking\" and she was \"good friends\" with the group, which \"did so much to raise money for charities\".\nTown councillor Thomas Tudor said he had been told the incident followed an \"out of the blue downpour\".\n\"It would appear that, unfortunately, the paddleboarders were caught up in that downpour which led to this tragedy,\" he said.\nThe incident happened following a Met Office yellow warning for heavy rain that was in place until Saturday morning. But flood alerts remain in place on rivers in Pembrokeshire, including the eastern and western Cleddau catchment areas, following days of heavy rain.\nDet Ch Insp Jonathan Rees said: \"Recent weather conditions and weather warnings have meant that the river was flowing high and fast and the conditions of the river will form part of the investigation to understand the precise conditions that the paddleboarders found themselves in.\"\n\"Every aspect of the investigation will consider the flow rate of the river, the weather conditions \u2026 and the rainfall which was high immediately before the incident.\"\nHe added: \"Paddleboarding is a growing leisure pursuit and we would encourage those engaged in the activity to ensure they understand the weather and water conditions\".\nMore than 20 police officers, as well as 30 firefighters from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, including specialist water rescue technicians, were involved in the rescue.\nTwo fire service boats helped with bank and river searches, which also involved coastguard teams and helicopters.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service also sent several ambulances to the scene and took the injured woman to nearby Withybush Hospital.\nThe coroner and the Health and Safety Executive have been informed and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has sent a team of inspectors to the area to undertake a preliminary assessment.\n\"The aim of the MAIB's preliminary assessment is to help with determining the way forward,\" said a spokesman.\nPembrokeshire council leader David Simpson said: \"The outcome on Saturday was tragic and I'm sure like me our thoughts go out to all those involved and our deepest sympathy goes out to the families and friends of those who sadly have lost their lives.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say he was \"deeply saddened\" and his thoughts were with those who had lost loved ones in this \"heart-breaking tragedy\"."

      "tags": "Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest,COP26,Brazil,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal. \nBrazil - where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories on Tuesday.\nThe pledge includes almost \u00a314bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.\nExperts welcomed the move, but warned a previous deal in 2014 had \"failed to slow deforestation at all\" and commitments needed to be delivered on.\nFelling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the global meeting in Glasgow, said \"more leaders than ever before\" - a total of 110 - had made the \"landmark\" commitment.\n\"We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,\" he said - and \"end the role of humanity as nature's conqueror, and instead become nature's custodian\".\nThe two-week summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. \nThe countries who have signed the pledge - including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the US and the UK (the full list is here) - cover around 85% of the world's forests.\nSome of the funding will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities.\nGovernments of 28 countries also committed to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa.\nThese industries drive forest loss by cutting down trees to make space for animals to graze or crops to grow.\nMore than 30 of the world's biggest financial companies - including Aviva, Schroders and Axa - have also promised to end investment in activities linked to deforestation. \nAnd a \u00a31.1bn fund will be established to protect the world's second largest tropical rainforest - in the Congo Basin.\nProf Simon Lewis, an expert on climate and forests at University College London, said: \"It is good news to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and significant funding to move forward on that journey.\"\nBut he told the BBC the world \"has been here before\" with a declaration in 2014 in New York \"which failed to slow deforestation at all\". \nThere are reasons to be cheerful about the proposed plan to limit deforestation, specifically the scale of the funding, and the key countries that are supporting the pledge.\nIt is also very positive that it will try to reinforce the role of indigenous people in protecting their trees. Studies have shown that protecting the rights of native communities is one of the best ways of saving forested lands.\nBut there are significant challenges.\nMany previous plans haven't achieved their goals. In fact, deforestation has increased since a similar pledge was launched in 2014. \nThere are often disputes between donors and recipients - Norway suspended funding for an Amazon fund in 2019 in an argument with Brazil's president.\nThere are also major questions over how a major financial pledge could be effectively policed. \nHow can funders verify that forests are actually being protected without spying from satellites or challenging national sovereignty in some way?\nAnd question marks also hang over a key plank of the new plan, which is to try to remove the link to deforestation from consumer goods sold in developed countries. \nOne aspect is eating meat from animals, raised on imported soy grown on cleared lands. Will governments push companies and consumers to eat less meat to save the world's most important forests?\nEcologist Dr Nigel Sizer called the agreement \"a big deal\" - but that some will find the target of 2030 disappointing. \n\"We're facing a climate emergency so giving ourselves another 10 years to address this problem doesn't quite seem consistent with that,\" said Dr Sizer, a former president of the Rainforest Alliance. \n\"But maybe this is realistic and the best that they can achieve.\" \nThe deal's signatories include a number of key countries. \nIndonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil, a product found in everything from shampoo to biscuits. Production is driving tree destruction and territory loss for indigenous people.\nMeanwhile, Russia's huge natural forests, with more than one fifth of the planet's trees, capture more than 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon annually. \nIn the planet's biggest rainforest, the Amazon, deforestation accelerated to a 12-year high in 2020 under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\nAsked whether leaders like Brazil's Mr Bolsonaro could be trusted to abide by the pledge, the UK's Environment Secretary George Eustice said \"we should be really positive when countries engage\".\n\"Last time there was an attempt at getting such a commitment on forests [in 2014], Brazil didn't take part, neither did Russia, neither did China.\n\"Brazil, they've really engaged with us on this agenda. It's a big step for them.\"\nBut pressed on whether the agreement will be enforceable, Mr Eustice said: \"It doesn't go as far into talking about enforcement mechanisms and so forth, that's not the nature of these agreements.\"\nHe said what was different about this pledge in particular is that there is \"the finance to back [it] up\".\nUS President Joe Biden said he was \"confident\" the global pledge could be met, telling world leaders: \"All we need to do is summon the will and do what we know is right. We can do this.\"\nHe said the US would lead by example, and announced it would spend $9bn (\u00a36.6bn) to conserve and restore forests.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nAna Yang, executive director at Chatham House Sustainability Accelerator, who co-wrote the report Rethinking the Brazilian Amazon, said: \"This deal involves more countries, more players and more money. But the devil is in the detail which we still need to see.\"\nBut many people living in the Amazon, including in its urban areas, depend on the forest for their livelihoods and they need support in finding new incomes, she added. \nPrince Charles told COP26 delegates that nations had to \"honour\" the rights of indigenous people as they were \"experienced custodians\" of their habitats. And speaking to members of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities - representing 24 countries with tropical rainforests - he said: \"We've got to work harder to save your forests, for all our sakes.\" \nTuntiak Katan, from the Coordination of Indigenous Communities of the Amazon Basin, welcomed the deal, saying that funds should be invested in supporting indigenous communities who are able to manage and protect forests.\nMr Katan, an indigenous Shuar from Ecuador, told the BBC indigenous communities globally protected 80% of the world's biodiversity but faced threats and violence.\n\"For years we have protected our way of life and that has protected ecosystems and forests. Without us, no money or policy can stop climate change,\" he said. \nOne of the biggest causes of forest loss in Brazil is to grow soy beans, much of which goes to China and Europe for animal feed for pigs and chickens, said Dr Sizer. \n\"We all end up consuming that, unless we're strict vegetarians and we don't eat soy. It's a very serious problem that we're all connected with.\"\nTrees are one of our major defences in a warming world. They suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, acting as so-called carbon sinks. They absorb around one third of global CO2 emitted each year.  \nUnder present targets, the world is on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in climate catastrophe.\nCurrently an area of forest the size of 27 football pitches is lost every minute.\nDepleted forests can also start to release CO2. If too many trees are cut down, scientists are worried that the planet will reach a tipping point that will set off abrupt and unpredictable climatic change.\nAlso on the second day of the two-week climate summit:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

They have led us nowhere.\"\n\"Inside COP there are just politicians and people in power pretending to take our future seriously, pretending to take the present seriously of the people who are being affected already today by the climate crisis. \n\"Change is not going to come from inside there.

They have an opportunity now to turn their warm words we've heard today into action.\n\"We cannot allow them to leave Glasgow without making sure that we are somehow closer to making sure the planet does not burn, and does not warm above 1.5C.\"\nProtesters from Extinction Rebellion made this point directly at Glasgow Central Station, where a small group welcomed conference delegates arriving by train.\nThe group held up large eyes with signs warning the delegates that they represented the \"world's eyes on you\".\nThe Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior travelled up the Firth of Clyde, carrying youth climate activists from Mexico, Uganda, Bangladesh and Namibia.\nThe Erskine Bridge was closed at short notice, stopping traffic for 90 minutes, to allow the vessel to pass. \nAfter uncertainty over whether it would be allowed to enter the city, Greenpeace said the vessel was given permission to dock at Govan.\nIt eventually moored at the King George V docks at Shieldhall, downriver from the summit venue.\nAssistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie of Police Scotland said it was outside of the exclusion zone, and the ship had not breached any COP26 restrictions.\nActivists travelling on the ship, including Edwin Namakanga from Uganda, hope to send a message to world leaders.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland: \"We have had a lot of UN climate summits but they have all failed.\n\"We believe if this COP includes more people from the most affected nations of the world, there will be more hope for change, with leaders not just speaking but at least taking some action before it is too late.\"     \nIn Royal Exchange Square, UK charity Oxfam organised a Scottish pipe band protest, with participants dressing up as 10 leaders from the world's \"highest-emitting\" countries.\nAngela Merkel, Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Joe Biden were all caricatured in the band which Oxfam said was guaranteed to produce a \"lot of hot air\".\nJacobo Ocharan, from the group's global climate initiative, said: \"I'm here because we are trying to convince world leaders that this is one of the last opportunities to change the track of the climate crisis.\"\nBack in June, the police said they'd identified four groups of people who might protest at COP26.\nThe first was the general public. People of all ages who want to make their voices heard. We can expect to see them in their tens of thousands when the COP26 Coalition holds its march and rally in Glasgow.\nThen there's the seasoned activists of groups like Extinction Rebellion who use what they call \"non-violence direct action\" to highlight their cause.\nThe police said it was possible there could be disorder - that a very small minority of protesters would become violent. Thousands of officers have been given public order training just in case.\nAnd the last group was people who would come to COP26 to protest against the presence of some of the world leaders.  So far, it's their voices that have been the loudest.\nA large demonstration has been taking place on the other side of the Clyde opposite the conference venue, with members of the UK's Tamil community protesting against Sri Lanka's prime minister.\nA demonstration organised by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), calling for regime change in Iran, was being held in George Square.\nHossein Abedini, the NCRI's UK deputy director, said he was in Glasgow to protest against Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials who had \"committed crimes against humanity\".\nHe added: \"The families of victims of executions are here today to ask the world leaders to stand on the side of the Iranian people and prosecute Ebrahim Raisi and other officials in the Iranian regime.\"\nIn Finnieston, a group of Ugandan campaigners gathered to hold a protest against the country's president, Yoweri Museveni.\nAlong the southern edge of the conference campus, protests were also held by French and Tamil groups.\nTamil activists lined the south side of the River Clyde directly across the from COP26, waving flags to protest against Sri Lanka's prime minister.\nAnd French demonstrators gathered on the Clyde Arc to accuse the French president of supporting the fossil fuel industry.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "A Red Arrows pilot ejected from a plane just before it crashed and burst into a \"ball of flames\", killing an engineer colleague, an inquest heard.\nCpl Jonathan Bayliss, 41, from Ingham, Lincolnshire, was an engineer in the Hawk 1 jet which crashed on the RAF Valley runway on Anglesey.\nPilot Flt Lt David Stark was carrying out a practised engine failure on take-off on 20 March 2018 at the time.\nThe inquest heard the pilot ejected safely.\n\"Sadly, Cpl Bayliss did not,\" said Katie Sutherland, acting senior coroner for north west Wales, as she opened the hearing.\nShortly after taking off, the practised manoeuvre had gone wrong.\nThe coroner said after reviewing the evidence, she \"won't just consider how, but how and in what circumstances\" the death happened.\nThe inquest heard Cpl Bayliss, who was born in Dartford in Kent, died from smoke inhalation and a low grade head injury.\nIn 2019, a Service Inquiry Panel (SIP) investigation found that the pilot was almost certainly fatigued and distracted during the incident.\nSqn Ldr Steve Morris, who was an instructor at RAF Valley at time, and a former member of the Red Arrows team, was on the runway about to take off with a student when he saw the jet piloted by Fl Lieut Stark take off ahead of him before going down.\n\"The rate of descent was significant. It caught my attention,\" he told the inquest, adding the crash happened about 12 to 15 seconds later. \nHe said he saw the canopy of the jet shatter and the pilot ejecting just a fraction of a second before seeing the aircraft explode in a ball of flames.\nSqn Ldr Morris told the hearing the best engineers were chosen to accompany pilots on certain sorties. \nHe added pilots had to regularly perform certain manoeuvres, such as a practised engine failure on take-off, and such manoeuvres had to be cleared before flights.\nHe also said the sortie in which Cpl Bayliss died would not happen any more.\nThe coroner asked Sqn Ldr Morris what training Cpl Bayliss and other non-pilots would have received in how to operate the ejector seat in the jet.\nHe said he could not talk about what the practice was in 2018 but now anyone flying in a jet would be taken to a hangar, put in practice seat, shown how to strap themselves in \"and then you show them how to pull the handle\". \nHe said once in the air, the pilot could not operate the ejector seat for the other person.\nCharlotte Law, representing Fl Lieut Stark, asked whether the volume and tempo of work for new members of the Red Arrows was intense, to which Sqn Ldr Morris replied: \"The pressure you put yourself under can be intense.\"\n\"Particularly during the spring months when you start to develop the formations... There will probably be moments when you question your own ability to do the job. \n\"It's a job you go into whole-heartedly and with 100% commitment,\" he added.\nHe also said that members of the Red Arrows have a range of other duties, including dealing with the press and members of the public.\n\"It's all part of being part of the Red Arrows,\" he said.\nSqn Ldr Morris confirmed he had instructed Flt Lt Stark before he joined the Red Arrows in 2017 and, when asked if he had any concerns about his abilities as a pilot, said: \"Not any at all.\"\nHe said there was no way for the pilot, in the front seat of the plane, to eject the rear seat passenger.\nThe hearing, which is expected to last up to four days, is continuing.

This causes global warming by trapping the sun's energy. "

      "text": "A man who admits strangling a 16-year-old girl to death said he wanted revenge on her mother.\nWenjing Lin died at her family's Chinese takeaway in Ynyswen, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 5 March.\nChun Xu, 32, denies murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\nWhen questioned by a psychologist, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mr Xu replied: \"I didn't mean to hurt the little girl. I wanted revenge on her mother.\"\nHe added: \"She upset me on many times and didn't listen to what I say.\"\nMr Xu also denies attempting to murder Wenjing's stepfather Yongquan Jiang at the Blue Sky Chinese takeaway, near Treorchy.\nHe admitted attacking 38-year-old Mr Jiang with two knives, but denied intending to kill him or cause him serious harm.\nProsecutor Michael Jones QC told the court Mr Xu had cut his own throat after the attack.\nThe jury heard an hour before Wenjing was killed, Mr Xu had used a search engine to ask \"can fingerprints be destroyed by fire?\"\nThe court was also shown body-worn camera footage of emergency services arriving at the scene, which included firearms officers moving around the building and the defendant receiving treatment for his self-inflicted injuries.\nMr Xu was a heavy gambler and owed Wenjing's family about \u00a314,000, the court heard.\nAlthough they were not blood relations, he was described as being seen as like a nephew to Wenjing's mother, Meifang Xu, but there had been disagreements between their families.\nIn December 2020, the family entrusted Mr Xu with \u00a320,000 that he said he would send back to China for them to pay a friend who had loaned them money to start their business in the UK.\nHowever, Mr Xu only sent some of the money back and gambled away \u00a314,000, which he had then begun paying back.\nOn 4 March, the jury heard Mr Xu travelled from the Pontypridd area where he was living and working in a different Chinese restaurant. \nHe brought with him one of the knives used to attack Mr Jiang. \nThe court heard he had asked for no-one to be told about his visit, during which he ate with the family and stayed the night.\nThe following morning, Wenjing was getting ready for school and messaging friends on Snapchat.\nMr Jones told the court she sent her last message just before 09:30 and did not respond to messages after that because \"she had by now been killed by the defendant\".\nLater, at about 11:00, Mr Jiang heard someone pacing around downstairs and found Mr Xu who invited him into the basement for a cigarette and to get some fish from the freezer, the court heard.\nAs Mr Jiang opened the freezer, the jury heard Mr Xu attacked him with two knives, stabbing him in the neck and body.\nDuring the struggle, Mr Jiang asked Mr Xu why he was attacking him, to which he replied: \"Money, money, money\".\nMs Xu then came down the basement stairs and saw the two fighting. She tried to ring a friend, and Mr Xu bit her.\nMr Jiang managed to get back onto the ground floor where he found his stepdaughter lifeless on a black mat by the takeaway counter.\nDespite attempts made by the emergency services, she could not be revived.\nThe jury was told that the defendant was found in the kitchen with a self-inflicted injury to his throat, which was later treated at University Hospital of Wales.\nMr Jones described how \u00a3900 was found in Mr Xu's pockets, as well as Wenjing's mobile phone and keys.\nWhen he was interviewed by police, he gave no explanation for his actions.\nMr Jones told the jury: \"We do not accept he had no intention to kill or cause serious harm\".\nA statement from Rhiannon Davies, the deputy headmistress at Treorchy Comprehensive school, where Wenjing was a pupil, said she was an \"exceptional student\". \nMs Davies said that on the day of her death, Wenjing had logged on for a Maths lesson, adding she would be \"sorely missed\".\nThe trial continues."

      "text": "Netflix is launching its first games worldwide as it seeks to break into the game subscription market.\nStarting Tuesday, the company will roll out updates to its Netflix app on Android smartphones, showing what games are available for download.\nTo begin with, five mobile games are included for Netflix subscribers.\nThe company is promising more to come - with no adverts in the game and no in-app purchases like those common in other mobile games.\nOf the five games launching with the service, two are linked to the streaming giant's popular Stranger Things series:\n\"While this is just the beginning of a long journey, we're excited to provide a gaming experience that is differentiated from what is available today -  exclusive mobile games with no ads, no in-app payments, included with your Netflix membership,\" the company said.\nWhile the initial games have relatively simple graphics and casual gameplay, Netflix says it is in very early stages, but plans to eventually create games \"for every kind of player\".\n\"Whether you're craving a casual game you can start from scratch, or an immersive experience that lets you dig deeper into your favourite stories, we want to begin to build a library of games that offers something for everyone,\" wrote Mike Verdu, the company's head of game development.\nMr Verdu was a major hire for Netflix, having worked at games giant EA and later at Facebook, where he worked on augmented and virtual reality. \nThis week's release is only for Android phones and tablets. Netflix said that games would come to iOS devices \"in the coming months\".\nApple has previously resisted attempts by other companies to put \"stores inside stores\" - particularly around gaming.\nWhen Microsoft initially launched its Game Pass streaming service in 2020, Apple blocked the app from appearing in the iPhone App Store, arguing that the roughly 100 games included should all be listed in its store individually. Microsoft eventually resorted to streaming through Apple's mobile Safari browser instead.\nNetflix did not say it was facing any similar issues with Netflix Games, saying that Android arriving first was down to the launch being \"still in its early stages\".\nDespite the delay in reaching Apple customers, Microsoft has become the dominant figure in the game subscription market to date.\nIts Xbox Game Pass service includes most of Microsoft's own game studio releases on the day they go on sale, many of which can be played on an Xbox, a gaming computer, or streamed over the internet to phones and tablets.\nIt is estimated to have tens of millions of subscribers paying between \u00a37.99 and \u00a310.99 a month, depending on the features they need."

      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "Former Fifa officials Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini have been charged with fraud and other offences in Switzerland.\nSwiss prosecutors say Mr Blatter unlawfully arranged a transfer of two million Swiss francs ($2.19m; \u00a31.6m) to Mr Platini in 2011.\nProsecutors say the payment \"damaged Fifa's assets and unlawfully enriched Platini\".\nMr Blatter and Mr Platini now face trial at a court in Bellinzona.\nIf found guilty of the charges, the pair could receive prison sentences of several years or fines.\nThe case was opened in September 2015 after Fifa, football's world governing body, was dogged by accusations of widespread corruption.\nFifa's ethics committee launched an investigation which saw both men banned from the game and forced to leave their positions.\nThe affair ended Mr Blatter's 17-year spell in charge of Fifa and Mr Platini's campaign to succeed his former mentor. \nA year later Mr Platini was forced to resign as president of Uefa, Europe's football governing body, after losing an appeal against his ban.\nBoth Mr Blatter, 85, and Mr Platini, 66, have denied any wrongdoing.\nThe Swiss case centres on a request for payment for advisory work Mr Platini did for the then-Fifa president Mr Blatter between 1998 and 2002.\nProsecutors said Mr Platini demanded the payment \"over eight years after the termination of his advisory activity\". \"With Blatter's involvement, Fifa made a payment to Platini in said amount at the beginning of 2011,\" the prosecutors said.\nThey said Mr Blatter and Mr Plantini have both been accused of fraud, misappropriation, criminal mismanagement and forgery of a document.\nOn Tuesday Mr Platini's Swiss lawyer, Dominic Nellen, told the BBC his client \"categorically denies the untrue accusations\".\nMr Nellen said it was \"clear that the investigation should have been discontinued long ago\". \n\"There are enough witness reports and documents in the case files that prove my client's innocence,\" the lawyer said. \"I am 100% confident that we will be able to prove my client's innocence in court.\"\nIn his own statement, Mr Blatter said he looked forward to the trial and hoped \"this story will come to an end\".\nHe said the payment to Mr Platini was based on a verbal agreement and had been delayed because Fifa was not able to pay the entire amount at the time.\nMr Blatter said the payment had been approved by \"all responsible Fifa bodies\" and that Mr Platini had paid tax on the amount \"at his Swiss place of residence\".\nMr Blatter and Mr Platini were two of the most powerful figures in world football. Their roles at the top of the sport's governing bodies gave them enormous influence in the game.\nA successful football player for club and country, Mr Platini was widely tipped to succeed Mr Blatter following his resignation in 2015, after US prosecutors charged several top Fifa executives with corruption following a major inquiry by the FBI.\nThe charges came after a dramatic raid on a luxury hotel in Zurich and the arrest of seven Fifa executives.\nWhen Mr Platini himself became embroiled in the investigation, he withdrew his candidacy for the Fifa presidency.\nThe FIFA ethics committee then suspended Mr Blatter and Mr Platini, before initially banning each from football for eight years. Those bans have since been reduced to six in Mr Blatter's case and four in Mr Platini's.\nLast year, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) rejected an appeal against Mr Platini's ban, which it said \"was justified\"."

      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "Welsh pensioner Jane Lansfield has come to COP26 in Glasgow for her grandchildren.\nThe softly-spoken, almost whispering, grandmother is perhaps not what you would imagine a typical Extinction Rebellion protester to look like.\nBut Jane entered activism after watching her community suffer a battering from floods and changing weather patterns.\nFor her, COP26 is about fighting for her grandchildren's futures.\nWhile Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Greta Thunberg are making the headlines, tens of thousands of delegates and visitors are all trying to achieve their own outcomes from the summit.\nFor some it's making their voices heard, for others it's about making contacts that could help their countries secure help as they adapt to climate change.\nPeter Weldon has cycled through wind and rain, all the way from Wales, to bring a letter to Alok Sharma.\nThe letter, from the mayor and town council of Cardigan, will be passed on and on until it gets into the hands of the COP president. \nHe told the BBC: \"It says 'please make the decisions necessary to limit global heating to 1.5'. Get your finger out, basically.\"\nHe added: \"The people running our country have got to be brave and make the correct decisions to make a difference, stop greenwashing and cling onto their authority.\"\nAnna Munro is also here to make the case for communities like Cardigan. \"We have had some serious flooding,\" she said. \n\"It has badly, badly affected a lot of people in Cardigan and in the local Welsh area and also we have lots of farmers who are already worried about crop failures. Everybody is already starting to see the signs of climate catastrophe.\"\nPeter and Anna have joined Jane in the ranks of XR to try to convince leaders that profit should no longer come before people and planet.\nJane said: \"Profit is a mirage if you can't live in the future and give your children and grandchildren what they deserve - a world which is habitable, which can produce reliable crops for them to eat, for them to breathe clean air. Anything else is a nonsense.\n\"I just feel this really matters and it has to be now and that's why I am here to help them to witness that, \" said Jane. \"Because I don't want to look my grandchildren in the eye and say I haven't tried.\"\nThe stakes are high for delegates attending from developing countries.\nMany are expected to return from COP26 with tangible results. \nAlfeus Vatilifa Shekunyenge is in Scotland on behalf of the Namibian government. He is hoping to return with some real money. He feels the pressure.\n\"We are hoping to meet with different climate financing institutions hoping to secure some funds to go back home and implement our climate related activities,\" he says.\n\"Climate change is affecting us very badly - Namibia is already a dry country. We have unpredictable climate variability and the majority of people depend on climate sensitive sectors for their livelihood. We have experienced a lot of droughts and flooding and outbreaks of diseases so climate change is already very real for us.\n\"I hope that we get solutions here, that the developed countries pledge more money towards climate financing and we get financial and technical assistance to implement the activities we need to mitigate climate change.\"\nBrian Mounde Ondieki feels the weight of his country on his shoulders as COP26 begins in earnest. \nHe is a climate change officer in the ministry of environment and forestry in Nairobi, Kenya.\nHe says he feels under pressure to bring home a good result from Glasgow for his country.\nHe says: \"Yes, I feel like everyone back in my country is looking upon us to make sure we get a good outcome out of this COP26. I cannot think about failing. I am putting my hopes high.\"\nMr Ondieke is here to follow the mitigation agenda.\nHe tells the BBC: \"I'm hoping that we will get a good outcome - the goal towards net zero and a good conclusion in going to achieving 1.5C\n\"The challenges we face in Kenya are that the developed countries have not yet achieved what they promised. It is very frustrating.\n\"If I could meet President Biden today I would urge him to ensure that the promise that was made to achieve the goal of $100bn by 2020, that this is achieved, so that developing countries can have the funding to make adaptations.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "What is historically the UK's longest lasting patch of snow has disappeared for \"only the eighth time in 300 years\".\nDubbed the Sphinx, the patch on remote Braeriach in the Cairngorms has melted away more frequently in the last 18 years.\nSnow patch expert Iain Cameron said climate change was a likely factor.\nAccording to records, the Sphinx previously melted fully in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017 and 2018.\nBefore 1933, it is thought to have last melted completely in the 1700s.\nThe Sphinx had shrunk to the size of an A4 piece of paper in recent weeks before finally disappearing in mild weather.\nStirling-based Mr Cameron has been studying snow patches in Scotland for 25 years and is author of the book The Vanishing Ice, which he describes as a \"lament\" to snow and ice that lingers high in Scotland's hills.\nHe worked alongside the late Dr Adam Watson, a biologist dubbed Mr Cairngorms because of his many years studying the mountains.\nSome of Dr Watson's research on the Sphinx drew on information handed down by generations of people who worked and visited the Cairngorms, which suggests the patch may have only melted a few times in the last 300 years.\nFrom the 1840s the Scottish Mountaineering Club began noting the fortunes of the patch, and more recently scientists and ecologists have gathered information. \nMr Cameron told BBC Scotland that historically the Sphinx was the UK's \"most durable\" snow patch.\nBut he said: \"That is being challenged because it is disappearing more often.\"\nMr Cameron said warmer weather due to climate change \"seemed to be the logical\" explanation for the increased rate of melting.\nHe added that the conditions were affecting snowy areas high on other Scottish mountains including in the Ben Nevis range in Lochaber.\nAonach Beag, near Ben Nevis, also has a patch of snow that has often survived from one winter to another.\nBut Mr Cameron said: \"What we are seeing from research are smaller and fewer patches of snow.\n\"Less snow is falling now in winter than in the 1980s and even the 1990s.\"\nSeparately from Mr Cameron's research, a report commissioned by Cairngorms National Park Authority and published last year said declining snow cover, and fewer days when it snowed had been observed on Cairngorm mountain since the winter of 1983-84.\nResearchers also noted a trend for increasingly warmer weather since the 1960s, and suggested that by the 2080s there would be some years with very little or no snow at all on Cairngorm.\nLauren McCallum, of international climate change campaign group Protect Our Winters, said the Cairngorms - and wider world - needed to be protected from further rises in temperature.\nShe said: \"We have to maintain a healthy temperature for our ecosystems and communities to survive.\"\nThe Sphinx lies in Garbh Choire Mor, a hollow known as a corrie formed by ice or a glacier during the last ice age, on 1,296m (4,252ft) Braeriach - Britain's third highest mountain.\nGarbh Choire Mor is described as Scotland's snowiest corrie because of the amount of snow it can hold even through summer months.\nThe Sphinx is the name of a climbing route near the snow patch.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Methane,COP26,United States,Oil & Gas industry,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US is set to announce measures to prevent millions of tonnes of the greenhouse gas methane from entering the atmosphere.\nThe measures will target methane leaking from oil and gas rigs across the US.\nIt is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities.\nA global partnership to cut methane is to be announced at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow on Tuesday.\nDozens of countries have joined the initiative led by the US and the EU to cut emissions of the gas by at least 30% by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. However, China, Russia and India - some of the world's top methane emitters - are not among them.\nThe main focus of efforts to curb global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is emitted as a result of human activities such as generating power and clearing forests.\nBut there has been a growing focus on methane as a way of buying extra time to tackle climate change. Although there's more CO2 in the atmosphere and it sticks around for longer, individual methane molecules have a more powerful warming effect on the atmosphere than single CO2 molecules.\nMr Biden will announce his plan at the conference in Glasgow, where countries are trying to hammer out plans to limit global warming in order to avoid a climate catastrophe by the end of this century.\nIn the US, the oil and gas industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions, responsible for approximately 30% of total emissions of the gas, the White House says.\nUnder the Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will propose new regulations that will broaden and strengthen methane emissions reduction for new oil and gas facilities. \nBut it will also propose regulations to require states develop plans that will reduce methane emissions from existing sources across America, including some 300,000 oil and gas well sites. \nAn \"aggressive\" programme would plug abandoned orphan oil and gas wells, including many that are still venting methane.\nThere would be new safety regulations to tighten requirements over methane leaks from the country's 3m miles (4.8m km) of pipelines, and the burning of methane waste at drilling sites on public land would be curbed.\nOne way to reduce methane emissions from agriculture would be through \"alternative manure management systems\", the White House says.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change\n\"The timing of this is critical,\" EPA Administrator Michael Regan told Reuters news agency. \n\"As we speak, world leaders are gathering right now in Glasgow and they are looking to the United States for true leadership. This proposal is absolutely bold, aggressive and comprehensive.\"\nAccording to Reuters, the new rules are most likely to take effect in 2023.\nPresident Biden's plan was welcomed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US-based non-governmental organisation which advocates for the environment.\n\"This step is critical to meet President Biden's pledge to cut America's climate pollution in half by 2030,\" said senior strategic director David Doniger. \n\"This EPA action will also bolster the growing international efforts - led by the United States and the European Union - to significantly reduce methane pollution at the global climate talks in Glasgow.\"\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API), the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, has said it supports direct regulation of methane emissions from new and existing sources but opposes efforts in Congress to impose fees on methane leaks, calling them punitive and unnecessary. \nIt argues that leaks of methane have decreased even as natural gas production has gone up as a result of the ongoing fracking boom, and says technological advancements in recent years have made finding and repairing natural gas leaks cheaper and easier, the Associated Press reports.\n\"Thanks to innovation and industry actions, U.S. methane emissions rates in the largest producing regions have declined 70 percent in the past decade, even as America produces more affordable, reliable and cleaner natural gas,\" the API says.\nAround 40% of CH4 comes from natural sources such as wetlands but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities, ranging from agriculture such as cattle and rice production to rubbish dumps.\nOne of the biggest sources is from the production, transport and use of natural gas and since 2008 there has been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US.\nIn 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era.\nWhat worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2.\nOver a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide.\nHowever, there is much more CO2 than methane in the atmosphere and individual molecules of it can remain there for hundreds of years."

She and her four children were living in a makeshift shelter perched on a high narrow ridge, the only safe ground for about 5,000 people.\nAt every high tide, seawater poured through gaps in a series of earth embankments meant to hold back the sea. Whenever they could, the men of the village formed human chains to pass along handfuls of mud to fill the holes - mud was all they had, and it never really did the job.\n'Hopenhagen'\nTo highlight the plight of the village - and the needs of all developing countries suffering from climate change - Oxfam offered Shorbanu the chance to make her case on a global stage. \nShe made the long journey to Denmark in December 2009 to the COP15 climate conference, the equivalent of the meeting under way in Glasgow now.\nWhen I saw her there, I asked what she made of the giant event - it was given the optimistic billing of \"Hopenhagen\".\n\"It's good to be with all these big people,\" she told me, and she seemed upbeat about the chances of them listening.\nAnd as it happens, while Shorbanu was in Copenhagen, the richest nations made a promise to the poorest countries - that by 2020 they would give them $100bn a year to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nAt the time, this was seen as a breakthrough offer because it signalled to developing nations that their needs and losses were being taken seriously.\nBut 12 years later, that target has not been met and, as things stand, it won't be until 2023.\nSo what does this mean for Shorbanu and the people of Gabura?\nA trickle of aid has reached them, but not remotely on the scale promised in Copenhagen, and much of the assistance that has got through was raised within Bangladesh. \nIt has paid for sandbags to reinforce some of the mud embankments, though the biggest storms still break through.\nA new school has been built and, when cyclones strike, the concrete structure serves as a storm shelter.\nBut all the time the rise of the sea, millimetre by millimetre, fuelled by the melting of the distant polar ice, contaminates local wells and keeps reducing supplies of drinking water.\n\"There is water everywhere around us,\" Shorbanu says, \"but it doesn't have any use. We have a serious crisis.\"\nThe nearest safe source is more than a mile away, at a solar-powered desalination plant built by the charity Oxfam, but reaching it involves walking in punishing heat and then carrying a heavy container back again, every day.\nMany people try to rely on water that's closer at hand, but find it causes skin diseases because of the high salt content and - for women in particular - washing in dirty water increases the likelihood of infections. \nResearchers are also investigating whether an increase in the amount of salt that women are drinking could explain the relatively high number of miscarriages in the region.\nShorbanu, now aged 44, sounds more worried and desperate than ever.\n\"We have no idea what we can do,\" she says. \"If people help us, then something can change. \n\"We don't have the money to move to other places. I have nothing that I can give to my children.\"\nOne of her sons now has a job on a shrimp farm. It's a growing industry as fields are turned into ponds, but it creates shortages of locally grown food, exacerbating problems of malnutrition.\nWhat does Shorbanu most want from anyone who might read her story, especially the leaders deciding the outcome of the talks in Glasgow?\nShe wants a strong embankment, which will not be destroyed so easily, and easy access to drinking water.\nBut most of all, she says, she wants action: \"We have suffered a lot - we do not want our children and grandchildren to suffer more.\" \nDavid Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit."

      "tags": "France,Nuclear submarines,Aukus,Australia",
      "text": "Australian PM Scott Morrison has escalated a row with France over a scrapped submarine deal, saying his nation will not accept \"sledging\" and \"slurs\".\nOn Sunday French President Emmanuel Macron said he knew Mr Morrison had lied to him about his intentions to renege on the deal.\nMr Morrison denies he lied.\nThe row deepened on Tuesday when a text message sent to him by President Macron was leaked to Australian media.\nThe animosity dates back to September when Australia cancelled the $37bn (\u00a327bn) deal with France to build 12 diesel-powered submarines, and instead negotiated a defence pact with the US and the UK - the so-called Aukus.\nThe agreement will see Australia gain access to US nuclear submarine technology - a move seen as a strategic counter to China. But it infuriated France, which said it was blindsided. Paris temporarily recalled its ambassadors to Australia and the US.\n\"I've got broad shoulders, I can deal with that [the accusations],\" Mr Morrison told reporters at the COP26 climate summit, in response to the French president's assertion that he had lied.\n\"But those slurs - I'm not going to cop sledging off Australia. I'm not going to cop that on behalf of Australians.\"\nThe Australian leader's remarks led to accusations that he had twisted Mr Macron's words as a rebuke to Australians rather than to him personally.\nMr Macron and Mr Morrison met at the G20 summit in Rome on the weekend - their first meeting since the row.\nBut asked later whether he thought Mr Morrison had been untruthful, Mr Macron said: \"I don't think, I know.\"\nHe told Australian journalists in Rome: \"I have a lot of respect for your country. I just say when we have respect, you have to be true and you have to behave in line and consistently with this value.\"\nSpeaking in Glasgow, Mr Morrison maintained he did not wish to \"personalise\" the row, acknowledging France had taken offence.\nBut he said he had explained concerns about the contract to Mr Macron in June. \nAustralian media then reported that Mr Morrison's office had leaked a text message from the French president sent two days before the Aukus deal was announced in which he purportedly wrote: \"Should I expect good or bad news for our joint submarine ambitions?\"\nThe implication was that President Macron was already aware of a potential threat to France's submarine contract. \nThe French leader's entourage accused the Australians of adopting \"very ungainly methods\". The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace pointed out that the SMS merely showed that Mr Macron \"did not know at one point where discussions were\", according to Le Parisien website.\nAustralian commentators have accused Mr Morrison and his advisers of trying to blunt the row's impact domestically.\n\"Imagine the jetlagged brainstorming on the midnight flight to Glasgow. Let's accuse Macron of sledging. Aussies will get that. And let's say he was having a go at Australia, not me. Australia,\" wrote Barrie Cassidy.\nOn Friday, US President Joe Biden also held his first face-to-face meeting with Mr Macron since the Aukus pact was agreed.\nDuring the seemingly awkward exchange, Mr Biden admitted that the US was \"clumsy\" over the negotiations.

      "tags": "Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest,COP26,Brazil,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal. \nBrazil - where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories on Tuesday.\nThe pledge includes almost \u00a314bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.\nExperts welcomed the move, but warned a previous deal in 2014 had \"failed to slow deforestation at all\" and commitments needed to be delivered on.\nFelling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the global meeting in Glasgow, said \"more leaders than ever before\" - a total of 110 - had made the \"landmark\" commitment.\n\"We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,\" he said - and \"end the role of humanity as nature's conqueror, and instead become nature's custodian\".\nThe two-week summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. \nThe countries who have signed the pledge - including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the US and the UK (the full list is here) - cover around 85% of the world's forests.\nSome of the funding will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities.\nGovernments of 28 countries also committed to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa.\nThese industries drive forest loss by cutting down trees to make space for animals to graze or crops to grow.\nMore than 30 of the world's biggest financial companies - including Aviva, Schroders and Axa - have also promised to end investment in activities linked to deforestation. \nAnd a \u00a31.1bn fund will be established to protect the world's second largest tropical rainforest - in the Congo Basin.\nProf Simon Lewis, an expert on climate and forests at University College London, said: \"It is good news to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and significant funding to move forward on that journey.\"\nBut he told the BBC the world \"has been here before\" with a declaration in 2014 in New York \"which failed to slow deforestation at all\". \nThere are reasons to be cheerful about the proposed plan to limit deforestation, specifically the scale of the funding, and the key countries that are supporting the pledge.\nIt is also very positive that it will try to reinforce the role of indigenous people in protecting their trees. Studies have shown that protecting the rights of native communities is one of the best ways of saving forested lands.\nBut there are significant challenges.\nMany previous plans haven't achieved their goals. In fact, deforestation has increased since a similar pledge was launched in 2014. \nThere are often disputes between donors and recipients - Norway suspended funding for an Amazon fund in 2019 in an argument with Brazil's president.\nThere are also major questions over how a major financial pledge could be effectively policed. \nHow can funders verify that forests are actually being protected without spying from satellites or challenging national sovereignty in some way?\nAnd question marks also hang over a key plank of the new plan, which is to try to remove the link to deforestation from consumer goods sold in developed countries. \nOne aspect is eating meat from animals, raised on imported soy grown on cleared lands. Will governments push companies and consumers to eat less meat to save the world's most important forests?\nEcologist Dr Nigel Sizer called the agreement \"a big deal\" - but that some will find the target of 2030 disappointing. \n\"We're facing a climate emergency so giving ourselves another 10 years to address this problem doesn't quite seem consistent with that,\" said Dr Sizer, a former president of the Rainforest Alliance. \n\"But maybe this is realistic and the best that they can achieve.\" \nThe deal's signatories include a number of key countries. \nIndonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil, a product found in everything from shampoo to biscuits. Production is driving tree destruction and territory loss for indigenous people.\nMeanwhile, Russia's huge natural forests, with more than one fifth of the planet's trees, capture more than 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon annually. \nIn the planet's biggest rainforest, the Amazon, deforestation accelerated to a 12-year high in 2020 under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\nAsked whether leaders like Brazil's Mr Bolsonaro could be trusted to abide by the pledge, the UK's Environment Secretary George Eustice said \"we should be really positive when countries engage\".\n\"Last time there was an attempt at getting such a commitment on forests [in 2014], Brazil didn't take part, neither did Russia, neither did China.\n\"Brazil, they've really engaged with us on this agenda. It's a big step for them.\"\nBut pressed on whether the agreement will be enforceable, Mr Eustice said: \"It doesn't go as far into talking about enforcement mechanisms and so forth, that's not the nature of these agreements.\"\nHe said what was different about this pledge in particular is that there is \"the finance to back [it] up\".\nUS President Joe Biden said he was \"confident\" the global pledge could be met, telling world leaders: \"All we need to do is summon the will and do what we know is right. We can do this.\"\nHe said the US would lead by example, and announced it would spend $9bn (\u00a36.6bn) to conserve and restore forests.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nAna Yang, executive director at Chatham House Sustainability Accelerator, who co-wrote the report Rethinking the Brazilian Amazon, said: \"This deal involves more countries, more players and more money. But the devil is in the detail which we still need to see.\"\nBut many people living in the Amazon, including in its urban areas, depend on the forest for their livelihoods and they need support in finding new incomes, she added. \nPrince Charles told COP26 delegates that nations had to \"honour\" the rights of indigenous people as they were \"experienced custodians\" of their habitats. And speaking to members of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities - representing 24 countries with tropical rainforests - he said: \"We've got to work harder to save your forests, for all our sakes.\" \nTuntiak Katan, from the Coordination of Indigenous Communities of the Amazon Basin, welcomed the deal, saying that funds should be invested in supporting indigenous communities who are able to manage and protect forests.\nMr Katan, an indigenous Shuar from Ecuador, told the BBC indigenous communities globally protected 80% of the world's biodiversity but faced threats and violence.\n\"For years we have protected our way of life and that has protected ecosystems and forests. Without us, no money or policy can stop climate change,\" he said. \nOne of the biggest causes of forest loss in Brazil is to grow soy beans, much of which goes to China and Europe for animal feed for pigs and chickens, said Dr Sizer. \n\"We all end up consuming that, unless we're strict vegetarians and we don't eat soy. It's a very serious problem that we're all connected with.\"\nTrees are one of our major defences in a warming world. They suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, acting as so-called carbon sinks. They absorb around one third of global CO2 emitted each year.  \nUnder present targets, the world is on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in climate catastrophe.\nCurrently an area of forest the size of 27 football pitches is lost every minute.\nDepleted forests can also start to release CO2. If too many trees are cut down, scientists are worried that the planet will reach a tipping point that will set off abrupt and unpredictable climatic change.\nAlso on the second day of the two-week climate summit:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A \"significant increase\" in the number of people receiving a Covid booster jab is expected in the coming days and weeks, the health minister has said.\nRobin Swann reiterated the importance of an accelerated booster jab rollout and said it would provide people with \"vital and timely protection\". \nNorthern Ireland's rollout of the booster jab is considerably lower than the rest of the UK.\nOnly 28% of those eligible have received a booster.\nElsewhere in the UK that figure is more than 50%, with Wales close to 60%.\nThe figures were revealed following a weekend when the health service experienced another weekend of severe pressures, with long waits for some patients at emergency departments.\nMr Swann met with senior health officials on Monday for an update on the booster programme.\n\"I expect to see a rapidly increasing number of people getting these jabs,\" he said, adding that he had been assured 210,000 doses had already been ordered by GP practices. \nHe said anyone who was 50 or older and who had their second jab at least six months ago could contact a community pharmacy to book a booster jab, if they did not want to wait to hear from their GP.\nIt is understood a number of meetings involving the chief medical officer took place last week exploring ways of improving booster delivery.    \nAmong those prioritised were care home residents and staff as well as other healthcare staff.\nThe breakdown of those vaccinated has not been published.\nRollout of the jab seems to vary from one area to another depending on how individual general practices are calling patients.\nWhile some GPs are separating the flu and booster jabs, others are organising patients to come in for both together.\nThat might depend on what staff they have available and the size of the practice.\nHowever, the variation is causing some confusion, even frustration, among some members of the public who say they are afraid of missing out.\nThe message from GPs has been \"don't ring us - wait until you are called\".\nThe chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland's GP committee said he was confident that over the next week \"vast waves of booster vaccines\" would be given alongside the flu jab. \nDr Alan Stout said that it comes as people hit their six-month mark, after having received their second dose of the vaccine. \nHe added that practices are continuing to prioritise patients, which is the right course of action, and the rollout lag is not a concern.\n\"Whenever you are given the booster, you are boosting from an already high level of immunity,\" he said.\n\"People, at this stage, haven't fallen off a cliff in terms of their immunity. We are giving it at a good time - in winter when they need a boost and which will protect them through to the spring.\"\nCommunity pharmacies are offering the Moderna Covid-19 booster to those who are eligible.\nA list of pharmacies across Northern Ireland who are offering the booster jab is available here.\nIn order to keep one step ahead of Covid - according to experts - vaccine uptake is crucial.\nCurrently 89.73% of the Northern Ireland population aged 18 or older is vaccinated - the aim is 90%.\nThere is evidence that immunity of the vaccine is waning, especially in the over 50s and 60s where there has been a noticeable increase in hospital admissions.\nThat is why health officials would like to see the pace quicken around administering boosters.    \nWhile the rollout of the booster jab has created \"additional\" work for GPs, this system has proved to work best as they can contact the public directly.\nSome are still coming forward for their first vaccine.       \nAccording to the Covid dashboard, over the past week 4,000 people under the age of 30 received their first dose.  \nDuring the Halloween break pop-up clinics for 12 to 15-year-olds got under way - data on this group is expected to go live this week.\nBut it was one of the busiest weekends of the year for hospitals and the ambulance service.\nAs of Sunday morning, 500 people were waiting in emergency departments - almost 200 for more than 12 hours.\nA source at the ambulance service said Saturday was one of the \"hardest and busiest shifts\" they had ever worked.\nAbout 90% of ambulance turnaround times were longer than the standard 30-minute wait.  \nA spokesperson said NIAS continued to work with colleagues in the health service \"to find a sustainable solution to the issue of ambulance turnaround times\", but current pressures are \"such that the current situation is likely to continue\".\nNIAS said it would seek to ensure that the most seriously ill or injured \"receive the quickest and most appropriate response\", but that would mean those with \"less urgent clinical needs may face longer waits for ambulance response, for which we would apologise in advance\". \nIn the Republic of Ireland, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has authorised the use of booster jabs for healthcare workers.\nThey will begin to be administered at the weekend.\nHe said this followed advice he had received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC)."

      "text": "A man who admitted killing two women in 1987 abused female corpses in two hospital morgues, a court has been told. \nDavid Fuller, 67, of Heathfield, East Sussex, attacked Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce in Tunbridge Wells.\nMr Fuller previously admitted killing them subject to \"diminished responsibility\", but denied murder.\nA jury at Maidstone Crown Court heard he had \"depraved sexual predilections\".\nWarning: this article contains information some people may find distressing.\nMr Fuller worked as an electrician at the Kent and Sussex Hospital from 1989, before moving to the Tunbridge Wells Hospital in 2010.\nDuncan Atkinson QC for the prosecution said he used the access his job gave him to enter both hospital mortuaries and \"carry out acts of sexual penetration of female corpses\".\nHis \"clear sexual interest in such bizarre and grossly repellent activity provides a unique and terrible link between him\" and the deaths of the two women, Mr Atkinson said.\nDuring Mr Fuller's arrest for the two killings, police searched his home and found \"a number of hard drives and hard copy images, carefully concealed and stored at his home\" which catalogued the abuse carried out at the mortuaries.\nThe footage, which Mr Fuller filmed himself, showed him moving the bodies into positions, onto and off gurneys, and performing sexual acts on \"females of significantly varying ages\", the court heard.\nMr Atkinson said the footage, filmed on a small digital camera, amounted to \"library of unimaginable sexual depravity\".\nThe court was told the offences were committed on days when Mr Fuller was working and had legitimate access to the mortuary with a swipe card.\nMr Atkinson said Mr Fuller had then gone back to name his images using ledgers from the mortuary and identification tags on the bodies.  \n\"He admitted to searching for them on the internet, including on Facebook,\" Mr Atkinson said, \"he claimed that this would be after the offending, rather than research before offending.\"\nMr Atkinson told the jury: \"The defendant was interviewed about this conduct in January 2021. He accepted committing the offences.\"\n\"He said he wanted to admit the offences, but that he did not want to go into detail.\"\n\"He said he did not know on how many occasions it had taken place, didn't know why he had started, and couldn't remember the first time he did it, but he accepted that he had sexually interfered with the corpses, and had recorded himself doing it.\"\nHis sexual gratification from the dead, Mr Atkinson said, \"provides a reason for the killings, however deviant and repellent, that does not depend on an explanation of mental illness that deprived the defendant of his self-control.\"\nBoth Ms Knell and Ms Pierce were also sexually abused at the time of, or after their deaths, the jury heard.\nNeither assault on the women was \"frenzied\", the court heard.\nMs Knell, 25, was killed in her home in Guildford Road on 23 June 1987 after being dropped off by her boyfriend.\nShe was found the following day, after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up to work.\nShe had been struck to the head with a blunt heavy object and strangled, possibly \"by an arm lock\", the court heard.\nMs Pierce, 20 was abducted from outside her home in Grosvenor Park on 24 November.\nNeighbours reported hearing screaming, but it was three weeks before her almost naked body was found more than 40 miles away in Romney Marsh.\nShe had almost identical injuries to Ms Knell.\nIt was not until 2021, when the techniques of forensic science had improved, that it was possible to compare the DNA found on and around the women with the DNA profile of Mr Fuller.\nHis saliva and other DNA was found on Ms Knell's bedding, a towel and intimate samples.\nHis semen was also found on Ms Pierce's tights, the only item of clothing she was wearing when her body was found in a water-filled dyke.\nA shoeprint in Ms Knell's blood is also a match for a pair of Clarks Sportstrek trainers Mr Fuller owned.\nThe evidence \"irrefutably links David Fuller, his fingerprints and his DNA, to the bodies\", Mr Atkinson said.\nAddressing the jury, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said they should focus \"not on whether he did what is alleged, but if he should be held responsible for it\".\nAt the time of the women's deaths, there had been numerous reports of \"prowlers and voyeurs\" in the area, with a similar description to Mr Fuller, the jury was told.\nOne report was made on the night Ms Knell died, and Ms Pierce also reported a prowler outside her home in October.\nMr Fuller had \"a history of such behaviour, looking through people's windows\", Mr Atkinson said, and had entered people's homes through insecure windows before, which saw him convicted for burglary in the 1970s.\nItems under Ms Knell's bedsit window, through which entry had been made to her home, had not been disturbed, and none of the other occupants of the building had heard any disturbance.\nHe later spied on a woman in a bathroom using a camera hidden in a pen.\nHe told police he \"knew that it was voyeurism and that it wasn't allowed\" but \"wanted to see her naked\", the jury was told.\nLike the files from the mortuary, he systematically labelled the videos and stored them in a digital library.\nMr Atkinson said Mr Fuller's mindset was \"methodical, ordered, controlled\".\nHe said Mr Fuller was \"a killer thinking about his actions, taking precautions and taking care. Put another way, a killer who had his wits about him, rather than being mentally unfit\".\nIn a police interview, Mr Fuller said he had been sexually traumatised when he was four or five years old and other events in his life had made him depressed, the court heard.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "A member of the group of scientists advising the government on coronavirus has stepped down from the role.\nSir Jeremy Farrar has been part of the independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) since the start of the pandemic.\nHe said he had left at the end of October so he could focus on his work as director of medical charity the Wellcome Trust.\nBut in a statement, he warned the crisis was \"a long way from over\". \nSir Jeremy also said Sage scientists had often had to work \"under huge pressure\" to provide \"vital evidence, and independent, expert, transparent advice\". \nIn his statement confirming he had left Sage, he said: \"The Covid-19 crisis is a long way from over, with the global situation deeply troubling. \n\"The high levels of transmission seen in the UK remain concerning, but I stepped down as a participant of Sage knowing ministers had been provided with most of the key science advice needed over the winter months.\" \nThe UK recorded 33,865 Covid cases on Tuesday, with the total number of cases in the past seven days down 10.4% on the previous week. \nDeaths are still rising, with 293 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. \nSir Jeremy said his focus now had to be on Wellcome, adding: \"This includes supporting the international research effort to end the pandemic, ensuring the world is better prepared for inevitable future infectious disease threats, and making the case so the full potential of science is realised to inform and drive change against all the urgent health threats we face globally.\"  \nHe said it had been \"an honour to have joined the hundreds of scientists who have contributed\" and thanked Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, and Chris Whitty, chief medical adviser, for their \"outstanding leadership\".\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"To lose a heavyweight figure like Sir Jeremy from Sage is a serious blow that reveals the level of concern about the government's mishandling of the pandemic.\" \nSir Jeremy expressed frustration with the government last year, writing in his book that he had considered resigning from Sage in September 2020 as cases were rising in part due to the newly-opened economy, and the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme. \nHe wrote in Spike: The Virus vs The People that he felt in summer 2020 that not enough had been done to plan for the coming winter.  \nHe also lamented the delay in introducing a further lockdown until November 2020, saying: \"The absence of a decision is a decision in itself.\"\nA government Office for Science spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that Sir Jeremy has stood down from the Covid Sage activation, and thank him for his contribution from the very start of the activation. Sage continues to provide government with independent expert scientific and technical advice.\""

      "text": "Rescuers are searching for survivors in the wreckage of a 22-storey block that collapsed under construction in Nigeria's largest city, Lagos.\nAuthorities say at least 15 people have died and dozens more are missing.\nRescue workers at the site say they have heard more voices from under the rubble. Nine people have been pulled out alive so far.\nThe partially built block of luxury apartments came down on Monday but what caused the collapse remains unclear.\nOvernight, despite the heavy rain, people used floodlights to continue the search digging through debris and twisted metal.\nIbrahim Farinloye of Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency told the Agence France-Presse news agency that rescue workers have been communicating with several survivors still trapped in the rubble. \nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari urged workers at the scene \"to step up\" rescue efforts in a statement on Monday night. \nMany relatives are now anxiously waiting near the site to hear whether their loved ones have survived. \n\"Our sister is inside,\" Fawas Sanni told AFP.\nHis sister, Zainab, was working at the construction site as part of the National Youth Service Corps.\n\"I was the last one who to spoke to her before she went to work yesterday morning,\" Mr Sanni is quoted as saying.\nMayeni Jones, BBC West Africa correspondent, Lagos\nHundreds of onlookers stand by in the crushing heat, waiting for news of survivors. \nGerrard Road, one of the area's main thoroughfares, has been blocked off to traffic. \nRows of women sit in the middle of the road, praying in Yoruba for survivors to be found. \nThe area directly around the site has been cordoned off to give rescue workers the space to get to those still missing. \nBut there's simmering anger in the crowd, frustrated at the slow pace of the rescue. \nWhile it remains too early to say what caused the collapse, Lagos emergency management agency manager, Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, suggested that some building infractions may have been committed during construction.  \nLocal authorities have ordered an investigation into the collapse and pledged to make the final report public.\nFemi Adesina, a special adviser to President Buhari, said the president \"commiserates with families who have lost loved ones\".\nThe building came down at around 14:45 local time (13:45 GMT) in the upmarket district of Ikoyi.\nIt was part of a complex named 360 Degrees Towers, which was intended to house luxury apartments, town houses and penthouses, according to the development's website, which has since been taken offline.\nThe housing scheme is being developed by Fourscore Homes Limited, which has a portfolio of projects in the UK, US, South Africa, and other areas of Nigeria.\nConstruction worker Ade John told BBC Igbo that he was on the ground floor when the building started caving in.\n\"There were 40 bricklayers who came to work, including some engineers on the first floor,\" he said, fearing that they had not escaped.\nA witness who was working in an office building opposite told the BBC's Outside Source that he heard a sound, looked out of his window and \"saw the building literally going down floor by floor\".\nAccording to the AP news agency, visiting Lagos' deputy governor Femi Hamzat was met by crowds of angry people on Monday who accused authorities of not starting rescue efforts soon enough.\nSome reports say the building was several floors higher than originally intended. \nBuilding collapses are common across Nigeria.\nBetween 2005 and 2020, 152 buildings fell down in Lagos, according to research by planning expert Dr Okunola Olasunkanmi.\nMore than three-quarters were residential properties, many multi-storey.\nOne of the worst incidents, in 2014, saw a six-storey building collapse during a service by celebrity televangelist TB Joshua, killing 116 people. \nIn many cases, unqualified or unskilled builders were used along with substandard building materials, Dr Olasunkanmi says in an article in the Conversation."

      "text": "Bird flu has been confirmed in poultry and wild birds at a premises in north Wales, the Welsh government has said.\nThe Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales confirmed the presence of the H5N1 strain at a premises in Wrexham county.\nThe Welsh government said temporary control zones had been immediately imposed around the site.\nA veterinary investigation is under way, but dead wild birds found in the area have tested positive for the virus and are believed to be the source.\nThis is the first confirmation of the disease in Wales since it was discovered among pheasants at a property on Anglesey in January.\nIt follows the announcement of similar discoveries of avian influenza in the UK and Europe.\nThe risk to public health from the virus is considered to be very low and these cases do not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers, the government said.\nChirk in Wrexham county is at the centre of the two temporary control zones currently in place.\nPeople are encouraged to avoid picking up or touching any sick or dead birds, while bird keepers are strongly advised to be vigilant for signs of the disease.\nThe Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales, Christianne Glossop, said: \"This is further evidence of the need for all keepers of poultry and captive birds to ensure they have the very highest levels of biosecurity in place.\n\"Public Health Wales has said the risk to the health of the public from avian influenza is very low and the Food Standards Agency has made clear it does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, Ms Glossop said it is believed that this infection arose from wild birds and there is evidence that H5 N1 flu virus is present in wild birds in Wales and other parts of Great Britain.\n\"I think it's really disappointing that we're back in bird flu season, so early this year,\" she said.\n\"We've dealt with the outbreak and we are monitoring very carefully the situation with wild birds.\n\"If you look at that map... you'll see that Chirk is at the heart of that zone.\"\nBird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. \nThe NHS says it can affect humans - but only in very rare cases. \nTo date there have been no cases of humans being infected with avian influenza in the UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said. \nBird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird, whether it is dead or alive.\nThere are two forms of the virus - high pathogenicity (HPAI) and low pathogenicity (LPAI), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says.\nPathogenicity indicates the severity of the disease if the bird contracts the virus."

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Will COP26 be a climate \"turning point\" as Boris Johnson wants, or more \"blah blah blah\" of the kind Greta Thunberg condemns? \nAt face value, things do not look promising, for a simple reason: the previous 25 of these giant conferences failed to turn off the tap of the greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures.\nDespite three decades of talking, the planet is now at least 1.1C hotter than the pre-industrial level - and rising. \nEven if everyone sticks to their current promises to reduce emissions, we'll still be on course for a dangerous increase of 2.7C by the end of the century.\nFor this conference, however, expectations for real progress are higher than usual.\nThat's partly because the risks are hitting home. This year floods killed 200 people in Germany, heatwaves struck chilly Canada and even the Siberian Arctic was burning. \nAnd scientists now have the evidence to say it's unequivocal that human activity is behind climate change and that's making violent extremes more likely. \nThey're also clearer than ever that avoiding the most damaging temperatures means halving global carbon emissions by 2030 - a deadline looming close enough to focus minds.\nAnd we are seeing something unimaginable even a few years ago: an unprecedented flurry of countries and businesses, some more plausibly than others, pledging to go net zero by mid-century.  \nThat means any greenhouse gases they're still releasing by then should be balanced by an equivalent amount absorbed from the atmosphere, through tree-planting for example.\nSo will Glasgow be the venue where the world shifts towards a zero-carbon future? \nIn truth, it's never likely that a single meeting could ever achieve that.\nCOPs were set up specifically for governments to tackle climate change, and the annual round of conferences does remain the only forum to tackle the problem collectively. \nBut they operate by consensus between nearly 200 countries that all have very different perspectives. \n\"Try herding 200 cats,\" one official once told me.  \nMany of the nations that are rich in oil or coal have been downright hostile to the whole climate agenda, and have tried everything to slow it down. \nOthers that are poor and vulnerable see rising temperatures threatening their very existence and are desperate for help. \nAt the first COP I reported from, in the deep freeze of a Montreal winter in 2005, the pace of talks matched the glacial weather. \nNegotiators were arguing overnight over 'square brackets' that marked unresolved and impenetrable points in a text that was never destined to leave much of a trace.\nWhen they finally reached agreement at dawn - and I spotted the then UK environment secretary Margaret Beckett with tears in her eyes - I asked a veteran observer what was being celebrated.\n\"They've agreed to keep talking,\" he said, without irony. \"So the process continues.\" \nAnd the conferences have rolled on, more or less productively, and at the nine I've witnessed so far, there have been some painful scenes.   \nIn Nairobi in 2006, I heard a frustrated German minister ask why anyone bothered to turn up.\nIn Bali in 2007, the top UN official, exhausted and exasperated, started weeping openly.\nAnd in Copenhagen in 2009, clumsy hosting triggered walkouts that nearly led the talks to collapse.\nYet one former UK government adviser, who was at the heart of those negotiations in Denmark, believes that COPs, for all their faults, are an essential mechanism.\nWithout them, according to Prof Mike Jacobs - now of the University of Sheffield - \"emissions would have risen even higher than they are now\".\nHe says having \"a simultaneous and collective commitment\" forces governments to stay focused on the problem. \nAnd that led to the COP that stands out as a rare example of success - Paris in 2015.\nThe French government, supported by a carefully cultivated alliance, ushered in the Paris Agreement, the first accord of its kind to tackle climate change.\nThis was a landmark moment because never before had every country agreed to act together to limit the rise in temperatures to 2C or, if possible, a lower target of 1.5C. \nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nYes, the most difficult small print was left unresolved and the accord is entirely voluntary - no country is obliged to cut its emissions faster than it wants to. \nBut Prof Jacobs reckons that setting up a global framework generated a sense of momentum, which in itself has proved significant. \nThat's because more and more of the world's governments are now setting their own targets for renewable energy or phasing out petrol and diesel cars, and that sends a message to businesses that the agenda is serious. \nSo investments in wind and solar power have recently been so vast that their costs have tumbled, which in turn makes a zero-carbon transition more feasible.\nAnd provided the Glasgow talks don't collapse in acrimony, that signal of a greener direction should get even more attention. \nIt could be a 'tipping-point' where big investors start to shift their trillions of dollars out of fossil fuels - a few days ago Europe's largest pension fund announced it would do just that. \nAlready the giant carmakers are having to gear up to go electric, and shipping companies - long accused of dragging their feet - are under pressure to clean up too.\nPlans to decarbonise even the most polluting industries - with so-called 'green cement' and 'green steel' - are becoming more mainstream. \nBut the speed of this response is the key question for COP26.  \nAs things stand, given all the pledges made so far, greenhouse gas emissions are actually set to rise by 16% by 2030, rather than fall by 45% as the science demands. \nAnd if the picture remains unchanged after a fortnight of talking, the accusations of failure will come thick and fast.\nA second challenge is finance for the poorest countries, hit hardest by rising sea levels, floods and droughts, and needing help to go green. \nThey've long felt let down, seeing promises unfulfilled, including a key pledge that was seen as a fundamental issue of trust, for assistance worth $100bn a year to be delivered by now.\nProf Saleemul Huq, an adviser to the prime minister of Bangladesh, is among those cynical about the whole process.\n\"This annual shindig is redundant - it's not as if climate change is an issue just once a year.\n\"It's happening now for everyone, every day, not some time in the future - it needs attention all the time.\" \nSo what is Prof Huq expecting? \n\"I presume they'll manage to pull a rabbit out of the hat in the end but you journalists must check the details of what's announced - is it really what they say it is?\"\nUltimately, the conferences provide a focus for climate action but they can never lead to a transformation overnight. \nThe observer in Montreal was right: it's about a process. \nAnd in a sign of managed expectations for Glasgow, there's talk of the next gatherings: COP27 in Egypt, and COP28, maybe in Qatar. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

Russia is the fifth largest after the EU and India. \nMore than 120 leaders turned up at the conference in Scotland's largest city. \nCountries have already announced major deals, including a global pledge to slash methane levels by 2030 as well as to end and reverse deforestation by the same year. \nBoth China and Russia are signatories of the pledge to reverse deforestation. Before Mr Biden's speech, Mr Putin virtually addressed a meeting on forest management at the COP26 summit on Tuesday, saying that Russia takes the \"strongest and most vigorous measures to conserve\" woodlands, according to a Kremlin press release.\nThe US president made his comments when asked about the role that other countries - including China, Russia and Saudi Arabia - had played in talks so far. \n\"The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader - not showing up, come on,\" Mr Biden said, adding that Xi Jinping's absence was a \"big mistake\".\nHe said the same about Mr Putin, saying that Russia's wilderness was burning and their president \"stays mum\" about the issue. \nMr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov gave no reason why the Russian leader would not attend when they announced the decision in October, although he said climate change was an \"important\" priority for Russia. \nThe same month officials warned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson that China's President Xi Jinping was not expected to attend. It is thought that President Xi has not left China since early 2020.\nIn September Mr Xi announced China will aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030.\nPresident Putin said Russia would also strive to reach carbon neutrality \"no later than 2060\" in an international energy forum speech on 13 October. \nNet zero, or becoming carbon neutral, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nRead more about the COP26 summit here\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change"

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. \nBBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions.\nYou can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page.\nHow is the average family going to find the extra \u00a320,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London\nYou don't necessarily need an extra \u00a320,000 to buy an electric vehicle. \nOverall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. \nThe average cost of an electric car in the UK is about \u00a344,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than \u00a320,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. \nAt the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. \nExperts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. \nThe UK government currently offers a grant of up to \u00a32,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles including some electric models. \nYou can also claim a grant of up to \u00a3350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint at your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. \nSeparately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buy brand new or used electric vehicles. \nHow will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden\nThe decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. \nThe cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. \nThere are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. \nThen there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. \nWhy are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia\nThe year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. \nThat's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050.\nMany of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. \nAt the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26.\nIf scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam\nQuite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. \nThe Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So \"well below 2C\" is already written into law as a secondary target. \nThere's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. \nThe challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change.\nHow can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain\nChecking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. \nAt the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. \nThe role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. But a recent investigation by The Washington Post found multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate.\nLast month, a UN-backed body launched a scheme to verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised.\nIs there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala\nOnly a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. \nIt would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. \nIt's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries.\nIn any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. \nThe damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change.\nAre there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands\nThe trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly.  \nIn 2020, for example, the UK allocated \u00a31bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. \nThat target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019.\nGovernment investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively.  \nHow do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore\nMost forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another.  \nBeef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. \nOne study estimates that rice, for example, produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world.  \nThe best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice.\nWould enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva\nMeat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. \nEating one or two hamburgers a week for a year creates the same amount of greenhouse gases as heating a UK home for 95 days.\nAnd a return economy flight from London to New York emits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2. That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK.\nIn theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. \nThe UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. \nUsing taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. \nWhy can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington\nThat is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. \nIn 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (\u00a373bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. \nPoorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions.   \nIf it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia\nOverpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. \nIt is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nIs the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter\nMatt McGrath writes:\nAccording to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. \nThis is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment.\nGlobal efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted.\nMeanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand.\nBut there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work.\nDoes COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham\nMatt McGrath writes:\nThe pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks.\nUnfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off.\nAs a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection.\nThey also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand.\nThere's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "A teenager who shot a boy in the face has been sentenced to 24 years in custody for attempted murder.\nJacob Talbot-Lummis, 16, wounded his victim, who was aged 15 at the time, as he was leaving home for school in Kesgrave, Suffolk, on 7 September 2020.\nJudge Martyn Levett said Talbot-Lummis, who was obsessed with violent computer games, \"ambushed\" his victim and \"didn't show any mercy or restraint\".\nThe boy was left partially paralysed from the attack.\nDuring the six-week trial at Ipswich Crown Court, jurors heard how Talbot-Lummis used a double-barrelled shotgun to attack the boy who he had been friends with since primary school.\nJudge Levett said Talbot-Lummis had played a virtual reality computer game called Blood Trail the day before the close-range shooting.\nA friend of the defendant said the game was \"hyper-realistic in its violence\", and that Talbot-Lummis \"adores it\".\nJudge Levett told the defendant: \"You had this obsessive interest in all kinds of firearms and had become entrenched in watching computer games online.\"\nHe said that playing such games \"was a factor for the onset of violent fantasies you had\".\nThe court heard Talbot-Lummis lay in wait for more than an hour before attacking the boy as he made his way to school for the first day back after the summer holidays.\nHe had driven his father's car to Grange Farm and shot the victim with his grandad's over-and-under Beretta from a distance of less than 1.5m (5ft).\nThe defendant had denied attempted murder and four other charges, but admitted to possession of a shotgun with intent to cause fear of injury.\nIt was heard he wanted to \"scare\" the boy, who he claimed had been bullying him and had caused him \"humiliation and fear\", but he said he fired the gun unintentionally.\nAfter the shooting, police arrested Talbot-Lummis later that morning in Westwood Avenue in Ipswich.\nPolice said they had to smash the car window to get him out and he then made admissions of guilt to the arresting officers.\nThe judge said Talbot-Lummis had \"ruthlessly executed\" his plan to attack his victim, who suffered \"unimaginably serious injuries\", still had flashbacks and continued to be \"reliant on his family\".\n\"The intention to kill wasn't formed on the spur of the moment,\" the judge said.\n\"This was all pre-planned and pre-meditated.\"\nThe judge said the defendant did not report his bullying claims to the school, and added: \"I don't accept there was bullying of the scale or the degree suggested.\"\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Det Supt David Henderson, from Suffolk Police, said: \"There is no doubt in my mind that Jacob Talbot-Lummis intended to kill the victim.\"\nThe court had heard Talbot-Lummis had a \"haul\" of lawfully-held BB guns in his bedroom, and Det Supt Henderson said the boy \"had experience of using shotguns, so his claim that the gun fired accidentally seems extremely unlikely\".\n\"The witness descriptions of his cold and calm manner following the shooting appear to reaffirm that firing the shotgun was indeed planned,\" he said.\n\"He did not check upon the victim or try to raise help - he simply coolly drove away, his plan fulfilled. \n\"Throughout the trial he continued this brazen and unfazed manner and has never once displayed remorse or concern for the victim.\"\nTalbot-Lummis was told that on his release from custody he would spend a further five years on licence.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The world is at \"one minute to midnight\", having run down the clock on waiting to combat climate change, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nHe was speaking as world leaders arrived for the landmark COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson said leaders needed to move from \"aspiration to action\" to slow global warming.\nHe added the summit was a \"critical\" moment for him, and said an ambitious outcome was still \"in the balance\".\nFor the first time, Mr Johnson also confirmed he did not want to see a controversial proposed coal mine in Cumbria go ahead.\n\"I'm not in favour of more coal,\" said the prime minister. \"But it is not a decision for me, it is a decision for the planning authorities.\"\nThe government has been criticised for not stopping the mine project going ahead. \nThis is the strongest statement the prime minister has yet made on the subject - and could help negotiations, because persuading nations to phase out coal is one of the central goals the UK government has set for the crucial UN conference.\nThe UK is hosting the summit amid mounting concern among scientists that countries are not doing enough to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases, which have caused average global temperatures to rise.\nThe 2015 Paris climate conference called for average temperatures to rise by well below 2C, and preferably only 1.5C, when compared to pre-industrial averages.\nWorld leaders arrived at the venue in Glasgow - which has officially become United Nations territory - for the official opening on Monday. Later, they will make statements setting out what their countries are doing on climate change.\nAs UN territory, the venue is being patrolled by armed UN officers and Police Scotland is only allowed to enter if they are invited by the UN secretary general - or if they believe there is a threat to life.\nOn BBC Breakfast on Monday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was asked whether it was necessary for world leaders to fly to the conference - as estimates suggested 400 private planes had flown into Glasgow.\nShe replied that it was \"fantastic\" that world leaders were there in person. \"When you really get into crunch negotiations, when you want to look somebody in the eye and talk to them face to face, you do need to meet in person,\" she said.\n\"World leaders are going to have to make some tough decisions\u2026 they're going to have to commit to things they didn't necessarily want to when they arrived at the conference. That's why it's really important we do have people face to face.\"\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she understood that the air travel involved may send a \"mixed message\" - but agreed that more progress is made when leaders meet in person.\n\"Given all of the travel required to get here, it even further increases the pressure on the shoulders of world leaders to make sure it's worth it,\" she said.\nMs Sturgeon added that the goal of the conference was to increase countries' ambitions to reduce emissions. \"Right now, the commitments countries have made wouldn't even limit [global warming] to 2C, let alone 1.5.\"\nThe COP26 summit immediately followed a G20 meeting in Rome - made up of leaders of 20 of the world's biggest economies - which ended on a downbeat note from Mr Johnson, after only 12 of the 20 committed to be carbon neutral by 2050. \nSpeaking to the BBC separately, Mr Johnson promised to add \u00a31bn to the money the government has earmarked over the next four years to help developing countries.\nThe government has already conceded that the developed world would not deliver in full on a promise made in 2009 to pay poorer countries $100bn a year to help tackle climate change - roughly equivalent to \u00a373bn based on current exchange rates. \nThe government has also been criticised for cutting foreign aid this year.\nMr Johnson urged other developed nations to commit more cash.\nHe said the other two central goals of the conference would be persuading world leaders to commit to accelerating the transition away from petrol and diesel cars and to stop deforestation.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nMr Johnson also defended the decision in last week's Budget to cut the duty on short-haul internal flights by 50%.\nHe described it as a difficult decision, adding: \"Even the distinguished Scottish politicians who are beating me up about this don't actually themselves come to London by any other means.\"\nThe comment appears to be a criticism of the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. \nMr Blackford branded the cut in passenger duty a \"disgrace\" and claimed it was evidence the government did \"not understand the climate challenge\".\nMr Johnson told the BBC that drawing more private finance into low carbon investments would be crucial to ensuring a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \nGovernments can bring billions to the table, he said, but the market has \"hundreds of trillions\".\nWhen asked what the Johnson household was doing to cut its carbon footprint, the prime minister joked that he had \"totally abolished commuting\" when he moved into No 10 and started living above his place of work.\nHe declined to say whether he had cut beef out of his diet, adding he had \"got to start eating a lot less of all kinds of things\".\nMr Johnson would not confirm whether he now regarded himself as an environmentalist, but insisted he was \"not the black sheep of my family\" on green issues. Boris Johnson's wife Carrie, his father Stanley and his brother Leo are all very keen environmentalists.\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury said climate change was \"absolutely a moral issue\".\n\"This is our neighbours all around the world, those who are already suffering catastrophic impacts,\" Justin Welby told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"This is life or death.\" \nMr Welby - who used to work in an oil executive - said he did not regret working in the industry as he \"learnt a huge amount from it\", and added the vast majority of people in the industry are \"pretty passionate about changing\".\nAdditional reporting by Francesca Gillett\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "The government has been defeated in the House of Lords over its one-year suspension of the \"triple lock\" formula to increase the state pension.\nMinisters plan to temporarily break the link between pensions and the rise in earnings, breaching a manifesto pledge.\nIt followed concern that a post-pandemic rise in average wages would have meant pensions increasing by 8%.\nPeers voted to restore a link with earnings. But MPs could still go on to reject their amendment.\nThe House of Lords backed an amendment by former Tory pensions minister Baroness Altmann to the law required to suspend the triple lock, by 220 votes to 178.\nIt will set up a vote in the House of Commons, where the government will have to decide whether to order its MPs to oppose her plan. \nUnder the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater.\nHowever, the government announced plans to suspend this for one year from April 2022, before restoring it. \nInstead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%, whichever is higher.\nIt came after the exceptional circumstances of the Covid pandemic meant earnings between May and July were set to rise by more than 8%.\nAnnouncing the move in September, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said it would ensure pensioners did not \"unfairly\" benefit from a \"statistical anomaly\".\nShe argued that \"would not be fair\" during a period when the government had taken \"difficult decisions\" such as freezing public sector pay.\nUnder Lady Altmann's amendment, the government would have to continue to link pensions to an adjusted version of the official earnings figure. She has said this would be around 5%. \nAhead of the vote on her plan, she said the government's plan to suspend the triple lock would set a \"seriously dangerous precedent\".\n\"Pensioners are not a cash machine for chancellors to take money from when wanting to fund other projects or tax cuts elsewhere, especially not in the eye of a cost-of-living storm,\" she said.\n\"Yes, this is for one year only, but what a year to choose to do this, while older people are facing a cost of living crisis and the protection they rely on is being removed.\"\nIn response, Work and Pensions minister Baroness Stedman-Scott said the suspension was for one year only, and the commitment to restore the triple lock after that \"remains in place\".\nMPs endorsed the government's suspension of the triple lock, when they voted on the bill to enforce it in September. \nLabour and SNP MPs put forward amendments requiring the government to review its impact on pensioner policy, but these were defeated.\nMPs could reject the Lords' amendment on the grounds of financial privilege, which gives the Commons primacy on issues relating to tax and spending.

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Tuesday.\nIn the COP26 summit's first major deal, more than 100 world leaders will promise to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The commitment, with almost \u00a314bn pledged in public and private backing, is supported by nations covering about 85% of the world's forests, including Canada, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But analysts warn a deal struck in 2014 \"failed to slow deforestation at all\". Felling trees contributes to climate change because forests absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. \nIn a video message to the summit in Glasgow, the Queen urged world leaders to create a \"safer, stabler future\" for the planet. She told them to take the long view and \"rise above the politics of the moment\". Among Monday's other key developments:\nThe arrival of world leaders has triggered a series of demos across Glasgow, with environmental campaign Greenpeace sailing its Rainbow Warrior ship up the Clyde and Extinction Rebellion protesters welcoming delegates at Central station. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg told an event near the COP26 campus by the Fridays for Future youth movement that politicians were merely \"pretending to take our future seriously\".\nA lot of big-hitters might be in Glasgow but if anything positive is to come out of the summit, there's a good chance it will be thanks to the hard work of people whose name you might never have heard. Environment correspondent Matt McGrath runs through five dealmakers whose efforts will be crucial during negotiations.\n\"It felt great to be heard,\" Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, says after addressing world leaders at the opening of COP26. \"The words I shared didn't just belong to me - they belong to my community, they belong to every single Pacific island.\" Brianna has been campaigning since a teacher at primary school told her climate change might cause islands such as Samoa, Tutuila in American Samoa and Tonga to \"drown\".

The rapid climate change we are seeing now is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) - that trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.

      "text": "Dr Aaron Beck, an American psychiatrist considered the father of cognitive behavioural therapy, has died aged 100.\nCBT, which was originally developed to manage depression, aims to help change the way people think to improve how they feel and alter their behaviour. \nDr Beck's work is considered hugely influential. He published hundreds of articles and 25 books in his career.\nA statement from his daughter said he had \"transformed the field of mental health\" with his life's work.\nDr Beck died peacefully at home on Monday morning, according to a statement from the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy that he and his daughter co-founded. \nAaron Beck was born in July 1921 in Providence, Rhode Island to parents who were Russian Jewish immigrants. He studied at Brown University and later graduated with a medical degree from Yale. \nAfter his initial training, Dr Beck began to question the basis of typical Freudian psychoanalysis which focused on uncovering conflicts buried within people's pasts. \nInstead of focusing on a person's unconscious, he sought to counter negative thoughts within his patients.\nPeople who undergo CBT are encouraged to question their own self-disparaging assumptions and thought processes to change how they see themselves and the world around them. Unlike other talking therapies, it focuses on a patient's current problems to improve their daily outlook.\nThe technique grew steadily in popularity and became widespread from the 1990s.\nIt is now commonly used to manage anxiety and depression, but it can also be used for other mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorders. \nA statement by Dr Judith Beck, his daughter, said she and her father had \"succeeded beyond our expectations\" with their institute's work. \n\"We now honour my father's legacy as we continue his work and further his mission of helping individuals live healthier, happier and more meaningful lives,\" her statement said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Wednesday.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid has warned the public should not \"let down their guard\" on coronavirus, insisting that \"we have got to keep working\" at making progress against the virus. In his first appearance before the Health and Social Care committee, he told MPs there were a \"lot more defences today\" including vaccines, to deal with any new variant, but that people must not assume the pandemic was \"almost all over or... all over\".\nMore than 120 members of the armed forces are to be sent to help 11 Scottish health boards with their Covid and flu vaccine programmes. There will be 100 vaccinators, 15 nurses and six command and support staff - with NHS Grampian and NHS Lanarkshire due to receive the largest share of the reinforcements. It comes as NHS Lothian and NHS Ayrshire and Arran last week warned of services being under severe pressure and urged patients to think twice before heading to emergency departments.\nMPs and peers have been told to wear face masks in Parliament amid a rise in Covid cases in the building. Until now, MPs could choose whether or not to wear a mask as per the latest advice for England, which says people should cover their face around \"people you don't normally meet\". Tours and banquet events have been cancelled and people in Parliament have been urged to follow social distancing. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the rules would be reviewed in two weeks' time. \nChina's government has urged families to stock up on essential supplies in case of emergencies, amid ongoing coronavirus lockdowns and concerns over vegetable supplies. Food prices traditionally rise in China as winter nears, but the price of vegetables has surged in recent weeks after unusually heavy rain damaged crops. On Monday, the country recorded 92 new cases of the virus. State media later sought to quell concerns amid reports of panic buying. \nAfter being cancelled last year due to the pandemic, street celebrations to mark the festival of Diwali are set to happen in Leicester on Thursday and will feature a strolling \"elephant\" and a laser rainbow visible for miles around. The city's Golden Mile usually plays host to one of the biggest celebrations of Diwali outside India, with Hindus, Sikhs and Jains who observe the festival dressing up, cooking feasts and exchanging gifts. Leicester City Council said the events would be different to previous years, with a firework display replaced by a fire garden, to reduce the risk of Covid transmission.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe morning coronavirus briefing is being paused for two weeks to tell you five things you need to know about the COP26 climate summit.\nThe UK is rolling out booster jabs for some people - find out who is eligible here.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "South Western Railway,Salisbury",
      "text": "The driver of one of two trains involved in a crash has suffered injuries believed to be \"life-changing\", police have said.\nPassengers described being thrown from their seats when the Great Western and South Western Railway services crashed in Salisbury on Sunday evening. \nThirteen people were taken to hospital with minor injures, while a passenger said a three-week-old baby was rescued.\nThe injured driver remains in hospital, along with one other person.\nRail services continue to be disrupted, with more cancellations going ahead in the next few days.\nThe crash involved the Great Western Railway (GWR) service from Southampton to Cardiff and the South Western Railway (SWR) train running from London to Honiton, Devon, British Transport Police (BTP) said.\nIt happened as the trains entered the Fisherton Tunnel, close to London Road, at 18:46 GMT as many families were out trick or treating nearby.\nThe trains were travelling in the same direction on different tracks but collided at a Y-shaped junction approaching the tunnel, with one hitting the side of the other causing it to derail, BTP said.\nA carriage was initially thought to have derailed after hitting something, and the second train then crashed into it, but Supt Lisa Garrett, of BTP, told a press conference \"there was nothing to suggest\" the train had struck an object.\nShe said of the 92 passengers on board the two trains, 30 people attended a casualty centre set up in a nearby church, with the majority \"walking wounded\".\n\"Unfortunately the driver of the train was more seriously injured and his injuries are believed to be life-changing,\" Supt Garrett said.\nPassenger Angela Mattingley said there was some panic in the carriages when everything went black and people were thrown forwards and hit their heads.\nLucy Gregory, who was also onboard, said she was launched across a table by the impact and ended up on the floor.\n\"They smashed the windows and we got out of the window. It was really scary,\" she said. \nCorinna Anderson, 51, from Derby, described being thrown against a wall and said a three-week-old baby was rescued.\nCameron Thrower, who was taken to hospital for treatment after injuring his arm and shoulder, said he was preparing to get off the train when there was a huge amount of shaking and noise.\n\"We were being tossed around and I turned around behind me to see a huge whoosh of fire and sparks. It was this huge calamitous moment when you go 'oh no' and you can barely put a thought together until you get off the floor and realise something has gone terribly wrong,\" he said.\n\"First moment was bewilderment when you get up, look around and realise you're at a 45 degree angle but then it was good to see everyone trying to see if others around them were ok.\n\"We were trying to pull open doors to get people out. It was a crazy moment you never expect to happen in your life.\"\nTamar Vellacott, 25, said she was walking outside with her young children, around a kilometre (0.62 miles) from the scene. \n\"It was a noise we've never heard before... my young ones started panicking thinking it was a bomb and we said maybe a lorry had crashed on the London Road and not to panic.\n\"There was no screeching like brakes, just a long rumbling sound like thunder hitting the railway line.\"\nMartin Frobisher, Network Rail's safety and engineering director, said it was too early to say what had caused the collision.\nHe said: \"Passengers must have had a really scary experience and we're very sorry for that. \n\"A detailed forensic investigation into what happened is now taking place.\"\nSalisbury mayor Caroline Corbin thanked the emergency services for their response and all the people in the area who offered their help throughout the night. \n\"I am hugely relieved that there were no fatalities and wish those who were injured in the collision a speedy recovery,\" she said.\nThe city's MP John Glen said he was thankful everyone was safe but there were \"many questions to be answered\" over what happened.\nDowning Street said \"the prime minister's thoughts remain with those who were affected by the incident\".\nThe disruption to journeys is likely to last at least a few days, with a senior rail source suggesting the position of the crash - half in and half out of the tunnel - meant recovering the train carriages would be more complicated and take longer. \nSWR said it was currently unable to run any services in or out of Salisbury station. A \"limited\" bus replacement service will operate but the firm asked people to avoid \"all but essential travel\" in the area.\nGWR said it was unable to call at stations between Salisbury and Romsey, in Hampshire, and buses would replace trains.\nIt advised passengers that journeys from Cardiff, Bristol and Bath to Southampton and Portsmouth would \"likely\" be faster via Reading. \nWere you personally affected by the crash?

      "tags": "Methane,Ursula von der Leyen,COP26,Climate change,United States,Oil & Gas industry,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US and the EU have announced a global partnership to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane by 2030.\nEU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden made the announcement at the COP26 summit on Tuesday.\nThe Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels.\nIt is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities.\nMore than 100 countries have signed up to the initiative, first proposed by the US and the EU in September. \nThe main focus of efforts to curb global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is emitted as a result of human activities such as generating power and clearing forests.\nBut there has been a growing focus on methane as a way of buying extra time to tackle climate change. Although there's more CO2 in the atmosphere and it sticks around for longer, individual methane molecules have a more powerful warming effect on the atmosphere than single CO2 molecules.\nAnd while one of the key goals of COP26 is to get countries to commit to achieving net zero by 2050 - meaning not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - both leaders stressed that they needed to act now. \n\"We cannot wait for 2050,\" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the summit. \"We have to cut emissions fast.\"\nShe said cutting methane was \"one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near-term global warming\", calling it \"the lowest hanging fruit\".\nUS President Joe Biden echoed her words, calling methane \"one of the most potent greenhouse gases there is\".\nThe pledge covers countries which emit nearly half of all methane, and make up 70% of global GDP, the US president said. \nThe speed with which the world has moved to tackle methane emissions gives real hope that the world is finally waking up to the massive threat posed by warming gases.\nJust last August the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that methane was responsible for a significant proportion of the 1C of warming the world has already experienced.\nIn September, the EU and the US brought the global pledge into being, and have persuaded some significant emitters to join the club.\nThe thrust is to cut emissions by 30% by 2030. The main focus in the short-term will be the fossil fuel industry. Most of the curbs can be achieved at little or no cost.\nThe potential benefits are huge - scientists believe it could help the world avoid 0.3C of warming by 2040.\nAt a time where every fraction of a degree matters, that is a major saving that could help keep the 1.5C threshold in play.\nBut there are some significant clouds on the horizon.\nMajor emitters like Russia, China and India are not part of the pledge.\nAll the commitments are voluntary - there is no big stick.\nDespite this, most observers see the pledge as a good step for the world and a boost for the conference.\nAround 40% of CH4 comes from natural sources such as wetlands but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities, ranging from agriculture such as cattle and rice production to rubbish dumps.\nOne of the biggest sources is from the production, transport and use of natural gas and since 2008 there has been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US.\nIn 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era.\nWhat worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2.\nOver a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide.\nHowever, there is much more CO2 than methane in the atmosphere and individual molecules of it can remain there for hundreds of years.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change"

      "tags": "NI Health,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new app which allows users to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination status within Northern Ireland has been launched by the health department.\nThe Covid Cert Check NI app will facilitate \"voluntary use\" of vaccine checks in hospitality and entertainment venues.\nThe department has also updated its COVIDCert NI app which allows people travelling abroad to prove vaccination. \nIt can now be updated to show the \"domestic use\" certificate. \nThe apps are free to download and can be used on smartphones and tablet computers.\nCurrently people in Northern Ireland are not required to prove their vaccination status in order to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.\nHowever Stormont ministers recently published a contingency plan which referred to the \"potential\" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in \"higher risk settings\".\nIt is one of a number of contingency measures which could be introduced over the winter if ministers feel such checks are necessary. \n\"Decisions on whether domestic certification would be introduced on a compulsory basis in Northern Ireland settings will rest with the Northern Ireland Executive,\" the department said in a statement. \nIt added that the new Cert Check NI app would be \"more user-friendly and reliable than using the printed vaccination cards to prove you have had both jabs\".\nThe earlier COVIDCert NI app was launched in July, in response to changes in international travel rules.\nSince then, more than 228,500 vaccine certificates have been issued to its Northern Ireland users.\nNow, people who have already downloaded the existing COVIDCert NI app for international travel will be given an option to activate their \"domestic certificate\".\nTo use this new feature, they will have to take a selfie photo with their phone or tablet computer which is then \"locked into the app\".\nThe purpose of adding the selfie is to prevent abuse of the system and it also avoids users having to present separate photo ID when they use the COVIDCert NI app as proof of vaccination status.\nThe department said users' selfie photos will stay on their device within the app but the image is \"not shared with or collected by anyone else\". \n\"Citizens are encouraged to download the app, and ensure that they have the necessary certificates downloaded, should they wish to present them,\" the statement said. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the app showed \"just how easy it would be to introduce mandatory vaccination certification across all our hospitality and entertainment businesses\".\nHe said while many businesses may choose to use the app, the decision should have been made at Stormont to protect the health service.\n\"The SDLP will continue to push for vaccine certification,\" he added.\nWhile it is not mandatory, Northern Ireland now has a Covid-19 certificate which can be used in domestic and social settings. \nIt looks a lot more professional than the current blue card that hardly resembles anything official. \nIt is available and good to go, but only on a voluntary basis. \nHowever, it does pave the way for the Northern Ireland Executive to introduce compulsory checks at the flick of a switch if and when it is required, for instance post-Christmas when health officials might need to call for greater control over the hospitality industry. \nThat might need to happen if the health service becomes overwhelmed, and by making vaccine certification checks mandatory it could mean avoiding another lockdown. \nThe new app was developed to assist Northern Ireland-based organisations to check their customers' vaccination status and can be scanned by participating venues."

      "tags": "Emmanuel Macron,Brexit,Fishing industry",
      "text": "France will delay retaliatory measures against the UK while talks over post-Brexit fishing rights continue, Emmanuel Macron has said.\nFrance had threatened to stop British boats offloading catches at its ports from midnight over the row.\nBut the French president told reporters the sanctions would be put off as talks between officials continued. \nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said there had been a \"big de-escalation\" of the row. \nThere had been \"constructive talks\" with France on Monday, he added. \n\"We very much welcome the fact that France has decided not to go ahead with its threats and we'll continue to have those constructive discussions.\"\nBrexit minister Lord Frost will meet France's European affairs minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune on Thursday to discuss a range of Brexit issues. \nThe French government said its measures would now not come into effect before this meeting took place. \nIn a statement, the president's office added that it expected the UK to respond to France's latest proposals on licensing by Wednesday. \nThe row flared up last month, after the UK and Jersey denied permits to dozens of French boats to operate in waters near their coastline.\nFrance had threatened to take a series of measures against the UK unless more licences were granted by midnight on Monday into Tuesday.\nRepresentatives from the EU Commission, France, the UK and the Channel Islands began talks on Monday, seeking to defuse the row. \nFrench media quoted Mr Macron telling reporters at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow these would now continue on Tuesday. \n\"It's not while we're negotiating that we're going to impose sanctions,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\"We'll see where we are tomorrow [Tuesday] at the end of the day, to see if things have really changed,\" he added. \nUnder the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years.\nBut there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed, leading to anger from France when applications were denied by the UK and Jersey.\nBig trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using things like data from Automatic Identification Systems.\nSmaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, would find it harder to provide this kind of proof.\nThe retaliatory measures threatened by France include preventing British fishing boats from offloading catches at its ports, and stepping up border checks on UK goods. \nOfficials in Paris have also threatened to tighten security checks on British boats, and increase checks on trucks going to and from the UK.\nLast week, a British trawler was seized by France while fishing in French waters.\nMr Eustice told the BBC there had been some \"administrative confusion\" but that he did not think the vessel was still being held by the French.\nBut Macduff Shellfish, the owners of the seized Cornelis Gert Jan have told the BBC they are \"not aware\" that their trawler has been released by French authorities.\nAndrew Brown, the company's director of sustainability and public affairs, said: \"Right now we are tied up seeking to secure the release of the vessel.  We are not aware that the vessel has been released.  Our understanding is that the vessel remains held at Le Havre at least until the hearing takes place tomorrow (Wednesday).\"\nSources at the environment department have told the BBC that contrary to Mr Eustice's previous assertion, the British fishing boat is still impounded by the French authorities in Le Havre.\nThey add that the boat's impoundment is seen as a \"routine enforcement action\" by the French and is not connected to the wider fishing row, so is unlikely to be raised as part of negotiations on licences.\nFor some, it seems, President Macron could never have won.\nPressing ahead with trade disruptions over \"a few dozen\" fishing licences risked looking stroppy.\nBacking down has been seen by some UK figures - and French fishermen - as capitulation.\nOf course, this row isn't just about fishing licences.  And a wider lack of trust between French and British politicians is feeding the fire.\nIn France, the deadlock is often explained by Boris Johnson's wish to blame someone else for the impact of Brexit.  \nIf the French are disrupting trade, the argument goes, any problems can be blamed on them.\nIn the UK, Emmanuel Macron - irritated by Britain's behaviour and months ahead of a presidential race - is seen as vindictive, needing to prove to his own electorate that leaving the EU is a mistake.\nThe UK government has said it welcomes the new round of discussions, saying it's \"ready to consider any new evidence\" to support the remaining licence applications.  In other words: its core position on issuing licences hasn't changed. \nThe two men who will meet in Paris on Thursday - France's Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, and Britain's Brexit Minister, David Frost - have been among the most outspoken critics on either side.\nMr Beaune said last week that the UK only understood \"the language of force\".\nThreats are one thing, but a real escalation could get messy for both sides. \nWill the language of diplomacy work any better now?\nBarrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said it was important that licences \"aren't just handed out like confetti\" to EU vessels. \nHe told BBC Breakfast there needed to be a way found to identify the vessels that had historically fished in the waters. \n\"I think it's the intervention of probably domestic politics in France that have escalated this out of all recognition from a fisheries issue.\"\nSpeaking earlier, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss accused France of \"unfairly\" setting a deadline for issuing more fishing permits.\nShe rejected a French accusation that the UK had breached the Brexit trade deal over the way it had issued licences.\nAnd she had warned the UK would be prepared to take legal action under the deal, unless France withdrew its threats.\nEmilie Devogel, who sells fish in Boulogne-sur-Mer that are caught by her husband J\u00e9r\u00e9my, told the BBC some of the fishermen are getting worried.\n\"We are starting to lose hope. We only want, while respecting fish resources, to be able to work just like before. \n\"It's very tense. We don't know any more where we stand and on top of that, some boats have licences, others don't, it creates conflicts.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC on Monday, Matt, a fisherman from Dover, said: \"We're only asking them [the French] that if they are going to fish in our waters to abide by the same rules and produce evidence to say they have been fishing in our waters.\n\"We have been completely fair, completely open and completely honest - the French are acting very irresponsibly.\""

      "title": "COP26: Four numbers to remember ahead of the climate change summit",
      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Glasgow",
      "text": "This week has seen a series of hard-hitting reports on climate change, timed for the days before the COP26 summit starts in Glasgow.\nThe conference, which starts on Sunday, is where world leaders are being asked to promise more ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases to prevent greater temperature rises.\nHere, we focus on four key numbers to remember from the reports, as we head into two weeks of big speeches and backroom meetings.\nThat's one Queen Elizabeth, who announced on Tuesday that she would not attend COP26 in person after her doctors advised her to rest. Wasn't her role just ceremonial, you might ask? Yes, but the 95-year-old is also an experienced diplomat and her absence is a blow for UK ambitions to bring some of her lustre to the global stage.\nBut it also gets to something bigger - COP26's guest list could affect its chances of success. If the diplomatic heavyweights don't show up, the agreements risk being less powerful.\nLeaders from 120 countries will be there, but Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and Jair Bolsonaro from Brazil are not coming, pending last-minute changes of heart. Those three countries are among the biggest polluters and the world needs them to commit to action.\nAnd then there's the impact of Covid-19. Travel restrictions and concerns over access to Covid vaccines for representatives from some poorer nations means some delegates from islands threatened by rising sea levels can't come. \nThey don't have the clout to make the big decisions, but they are the soul of COPs. They bring the lived experience of climate change to the conference - decisions made here are critical to their lives and their words carry that weight.\nThe year when the world will finally meet its target to give $100bn to the developing world to help it absorb the impacts of climate change - three years behind the original target of 2020.\nSome of that money pays for adaptation - from something as simple as shelters for people to run to in storms, to massive improvements to sea defences or weather forecast systems.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nThe delay is a serious blow to trust, and could make it harder to get significant progress at the summit. For years richer countries promised to hand the money over, and have kept missing the target. Will developing countries believe that other promises will be kept?\nBut the delegations may also decide that the money is so close to being delivered, and that action is so urgent, they are willing to put aside their anger.\nThe amount by which global average temperature will rise compared with pre-industrial times, if no further cuts in emissions are agreed, according to a UN report released on Tuesday.\nThat's significantly above the commitments in the 2015 Paris agreement to keep to any rise to 1.5C and \"well below 2C\".\nThis figure is not a surprise and it doesn't mean that negotiators will abandon hope of keeping 1.5C alive, but it underlines the urgency behind the summit.\nThere is a lot to play for. We've seen some significant progress on promises to reach net zero by 2050 - that would be when we stop adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than we can take out of it.\nIn all likelihood, the conference  will see some progress on reining in emissions from various sectors, but will they be fast enough or deep enough to see cuts of 55% by 2030 which is what scientists say needs to happen to keep 1.5C alive?\nThe finer details of the deals negotiated will make a difference. There will be questions about the common time frames - the schedules that countries agree to keep for their climate promises - and governments being transparent about successes and failures.\nThat's how much carbon dioxide there is in our atmosphere, according to the latest figures from the World Meteorological Organization.\nThis is a record high, and it is a problem because CO2 is the most significant of the warming gases pushing up global temperatures.\nThis is another warning bell ahead of COP26. One of the reasons that CO2 concentrations rose, despite the pandemic, is because trees and oceans have stopped absorbing as much carbon after deforestation and sea temperature increases.\nScientists are worried about runaway climate change as these so-called carbon sinks reduce their gas absorption.\nIf nature is kind to us, keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C is more achievable. But if planetary changes cause trees, oceans and other areas like wetlands to emit more greenhouse gases, our climate change problem becomes far more of an existential crisis than it is now.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there is \"a long way to go\" in the fight to curb climate change - but he is \"cautiously optimistic\". \nSpeaking at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, he said the doomsday clock \"is still ticking\", but \"we've got a bomb disposal team on site\". \nWorld leaders are leaving the summit, with negotiators for each nation taking over to agree on climate pledges.\nMore than 100 countries agreed on Tuesday to cut emissions of methane. \nThe US-EU global partnership aims to limit the emissions by 30%, compared with 2020 levels. \nAs the second full day of the pivotal summit concluded:\nDespite some notable absences, senior figures championed the breakthroughs made as world leaders began to depart Glasgow, leaving behind teams of country negotiators for the next 10 days.\nMr Johnson said a pledge by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to switch half the country's power grid to renewable sources by 2030 was a \"massive commitment\".\n\"I've seen more energy and more commitment and more urgency than I've ever seen and I've been doing this since 1988,\" US climate envoy John Kerry said.\nBut there is some way to go if leaders are to get an agreement that would keep alive the prospect set out in the Paris Agreement of restricting global temperature rises to 1.5C, according to the prime minister. \nChina is said to be one of those pushing back against a focus on limiting warming to 1.5C.\nMr Johnson told a news conference \"one thing that gives me optimism - for the countries who find it most difficult to transition from fossil fuels, we're starting to form those coalitions to help them\". \nBut he added that \"if we don't fix our climate, it will be an economic catastrophe as well as a environmental catastrophe\". \nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nHe said the public \"may not listen to me, but they certainly listen to Sir David Attenborough (who spoke at the summit on Monday) and they look at what's actually happening around the world\", referring to natural disasters in recent years.\nAhead of the summit, hosted by the UK, he had compared the fight against further climate change to a football match - suggesting humanity was 5-1 down at half-time. \nWith the world already experiencing dangerous heating, it's vital for this conference to produce more than what the activist Greta Thunberg calls \"blah blah blah\". \nToday world leaders have announced initiatives of some significance.\nIn one declaration, more than 100 countries promised to reverse deforestation by 2030. The pledge includes almost \u00a314bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.\nAnother major announcement is a pact to cut emissions of methane by 30% by 2030.\nThe third eye-catching action was an agreement between 40 nations, including the UK, China, India and the US, to work together to create standards and incentives for new technologies.\nAnd in a fourth announcement, the governments of France, Germany, the UK, the US, and the EU, have outlined a partnership to get South Africa off coal, with an initial funding of \u00a36bn ($8.5bn).\nThese actions together won't solve the climate problem. But they do demonstrate some valuable new thinking. \nThe prime minister said: \"We've pulled back a goal, or perhaps even two, and I think we are going to be able to take this thing to extra-time, because there's no doubt that some progress has been made.\"\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband responded by saying: \"The score that really matters is whether we cut carbon emissions by half this decade.\"\nMr Johnson also said that while the \"doomsday clock was still ticking\" - having previously said it is at a minute to midnight - there was now a bomb disposal team on site and \"they're starting to snip the wires - I hope some of the right wires\".\nAs he prepared to return to London, Mr Johnson told the teams remaining in Glasgow: \"The eyes of the world are on you - the eyes of the British government and all the other governments that care about this - and we have got your numbers.\" \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "COP26,Accessibility",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has apologised to an Israeli minister who was unable to access COP26 in her wheelchair.  \nKarine Elharrar was forced to return to her hotel 50 miles away on Monday after waiting outside for two hours.\nThe UK prime minister told her he was sorry for the \"confusion\" when the energy minister joined a meeting with him and Israel's PM, Naftali Bennett.\nMr Bennett thanked his British counterpart for his \"quick intervention on this unfortunate incident\".\nAnd he called it a \"learning opportunity for all of us in the importance of accessibility for all\", a statement backed by Mr Johnson.  \nMs Elharrar - who has muscular dystrophy - told BBC News she had gone into the climate summit on Tuesday \"very easily\" and it was \"quite a different experience\".\nBut she said Monday's incident had been \"a good experience to make sure the next UN conference will be accessible\".\nThe minister added: \"We can talk about accessibility and the rights of people with disabilities, but in life we need to implement all the conventions and all the regulations and that was an experience that showed that we need to pay attention to all the details everywhere.\n\"I am sure it will be different in the future.\" \nEarlier, the UK's Environment Secretary, George Eustice, said the incident involving Ms Elharrar was \"deeply regrettable\" and that the UK government had apologised. \nBut disability charity Scope said it was \"inexcusable\" and the organisers \"should have seen this coming\".\nMr Johnson's apology has coincided with Purple Tuesday - an awareness day set up to make organisations improve the experience of their disabled customers. \nMr Eustice appeared to blame the Israeli delegation for the fact Ms Elharrar could not get into the venue, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What would normally happen in this situation is that Israel would have communicated that they had that particular need for their minister. \n\"There was obviously something that went wrong in this instance and they weren't aware of that so they hadn't made the right provisions at that particular entrance she was coming too.\"\nHe added: \"I know that at most of the other entrances there [is] wheelchair access there. It was because she obviously came to an entrance that didn't have that provision.\"\nBut a spokesman from the Israeli Embassy in London said the country's delegation to the summit had \"communicated over the past several weeks all the details about the minister's requirements\".\nMr Eustice faced some criticism for the remarks, with Lib Dem peer Lady Ludford tweeting: \"Not the most gracious of responses for the COP26 host to blame the guest.\"\nOn Monday, Ms Elharrar told Israel's Channel 12 that she could not get onto the grounds of the conference because the only options were to either walk or take a shuttle that was not suitable for a wheelchair. \nHer office told the Times of Israel she waited outside the venue in Glasgow for two hours, and she was eventually forced to return to her hotel in the Scottish capital Edinburgh 80km (50 miles) away.\nOn Monday, she tweeted that it was \"sad\" the UN \"does not provide accessibility to its events\".\nAnd an official in Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's delegation said they had formally complained to organisers.\nReacting to the incident, Alison Kerry of Scope said: \"It is inexcusable that the organisers of COP26 haven't made all of their venue accessible for disabled people. \n\"No one should be excluded from participating in an event that is addressing one of the biggest issues of our time.\"  \nShe added: \"The organisers should have seen this coming. With one in five of us being disabled, it should come as no surprise that a venue hosting tens of thousands of delegates will need to make a significant number of reasonable adjustments. \n\"It's high time accessibility is built in from the start and not an afterthought.\"\nThe organisers of COP26 told the BBC that the main venue was fully wheelchair accessible, while temporary structures built around it had all undergone accessibility checks and were fully compliant. \nA COP26 spokeswoman said: \"This was a genuine mistake and we have apologised to Minister Elharrar -we look forward to her attendance at COP26 today [Tuesday]. \n\"We remain committed to an inclusive event accessible to all and the venue was designed to facilitate that.\""

Jaffer has since left the force.\nMet Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick called the actions of her officers \"utterly unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply insensitive\".\nShe said: \"Our thoughts today are with the family and friends of Bibaa and Nicole. \n\"I deeply regret that at a time when they were grieving the loss of their loved ones who were taken in such awful circumstances, they faced additional distress caused by the actions of two police officers.\n\"I apologised to Bibaa and Nicole's family in June last year and, on behalf of the Met, I apologise again today.\"\nDame Cressida said the two officers would face \"an accelerated misconduct process\" to decide if they can keep their jobs.\nLast week, Danyal Hussein, 19, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 35 years for murdering Ms Henry and 27-year-old Ms Smallman.\nThe sisters had been celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday when they were repeatedly stabbed by Hussein, from Blackheath in south-east London.\nA search of his bedroom revealed he had made an apparent blood pact with a demon to \"sacrifice\" six women in six months in order to win the lottery.\nPaul Goddard, from the CPS, said: \"PC Jamie Lewis and PC Deniz Jaffer's senseless conduct fell way below that to be expected from police officers.\n\"These officers were tasked with protecting a tragic crime scene, but instead they violated it for their own purposes, with no regard to the dignity of the victims, or the harm they might do to a murder investigation.\n\"Their thoughtless and insensitive actions have no doubt caused immeasurable further distress and pain to the heartbroken family and friends of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry who were already left reeling from the loss of their loved ones.\""

      "text": "More than 20 people have been killed and at least 16 injured in a gun and bomb assault on a military hospital in the Afghan capital Kabul.\nAttackers targeted the 400-bed Sardar Daud Khan hospital starting with two massive explosions outside the building, officials said.\nGunmen then broke into the hospital grounds, witnesses said.\nAn affiliate of the Islamic State group, IS-K, later said it had carried out the attack.\nPhotographs and video footage from Kabul showed a plume of smoke over the area and recorded the sounds of gunfire. A doctor in the building told the AFP news agency he had been sent to seek shelter in a safe room during the attack and could hear guns being fired.\nSayed Ahad told broadcaster EVN that one of the blasts was a suicide attack. \n\"As an Afghan citizen, I am really tired of this war, suicide and explosions,\" he said. \"How long do we have to endure this misery?\"\nThe Taliban spokesman, Bilal Karimi, told the BBC that fighters from IS-K had entered the compound after detonating the first explosion at the entrance gate. \nMr Karimi said Taliban fighters shot and killed four IS-K attackers and captured one alive. \nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid meanwhile told Reuters news agency that Taliban special forces dropped by helicopter had stopped the attackers from entering the hospital itself, killing them at the entrance or in the building's courtyard. All the assailants were killed in 15 minutes, he said.\nWitnesses quoted by Reuters said they saw two helicopters over the area during the assault. The news agency reports that this would be one of the first times Taliban forces have used aircraft captured from the previous, Western-backed government during an operation.\nThe attack is the latest to hit Afghanistan since the Taliban seized control in August, after the US withdrew its last troops from the country. \nIS-K, which stands for Islamic State Khorasan, has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks targeting civilians and Taliban fighters. \nIn August, a bombing by IS-K at Kabul international airport in August killed more than 150 civilians and 13 US soldiers. \nThe Sardar Daud Khan hospital has been targeted before. More than 30 people were killed and 50 others wounded in 2017 when gunmen dressed as doctors stormed the building. That attack was also claimed by the Islamic State group."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A \"significant increase\" in the number of people receiving a Covid booster jab is expected in the coming days and weeks, the health minister has said.\nRobin Swann reiterated the importance of an accelerated booster jab rollout and said it would provide people with \"vital and timely protection\". \nNorthern Ireland's rollout of the booster jab is considerably lower than the rest of the UK.\nOnly 28% of those eligible have received a booster.\nElsewhere in the UK that figure is more than 50%, with Wales close to 60%.\nThe figures were revealed following a weekend when the health service experienced another weekend of severe pressures, with long waits for some patients at emergency departments.\nMr Swann met with senior health officials on Monday for an update on the booster programme.\n\"I expect to see a rapidly increasing number of people getting these jabs,\" he said, adding that he had been assured 210,000 doses had already been ordered by GP practices. \nHe said anyone who was 50 or older and who had their second jab at least six months ago could contact a community pharmacy to book a booster jab, if they did not want to wait to hear from their GP.\nIt is understood a number of meetings involving the chief medical officer took place last week exploring ways of improving booster delivery.    \nAmong those prioritised were care home residents and staff as well as other healthcare staff.\nThe breakdown of those vaccinated has not been published.\nRollout of the jab seems to vary from one area to another depending on how individual general practices are calling patients.\nWhile some GPs are separating the flu and booster jabs, others are organising patients to come in for both together.\nThat might depend on what staff they have available and the size of the practice.\nHowever, the variation is causing some confusion, even frustration, among some members of the public who say they are afraid of missing out.\nThe message from GPs has been \"don't ring us - wait until you are called\".\nThe chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland's GP committee said he was confident that over the next week \"vast waves of booster vaccines\" would be given alongside the flu jab. \nDr Alan Stout said that it comes as people hit their six-month mark, after having received their second dose of the vaccine. \nHe added that practices are continuing to prioritise patients, which is the right course of action, and the rollout lag is not a concern.\n\"Whenever you are given the booster, you are boosting from an already high level of immunity,\" he said.\n\"People, at this stage, haven't fallen off a cliff in terms of their immunity. We are giving it at a good time - in winter when they need a boost and which will protect them through to the spring.\"\nCommunity pharmacies are offering the Moderna Covid-19 booster to those who are eligible.\nA list of pharmacies across Northern Ireland who are offering the booster jab is available here.\nIn order to keep one step ahead of Covid - according to experts - vaccine uptake is crucial.\nCurrently 89.73% of the Northern Ireland population aged 18 or older is vaccinated - the aim is 90%.\nThere is evidence that immunity of the vaccine is waning, especially in the over 50s and 60s where there has been a noticeable increase in hospital admissions.\nThat is why health officials would like to see the pace quicken around administering boosters.    \nWhile the rollout of the booster jab has created \"additional\" work for GPs, this system has proved to work best as they can contact the public directly.\nSome are still coming forward for their first vaccine.       \nAccording to the Covid dashboard, over the past week 4,000 people under the age of 30 received their first dose.  \nDuring the Halloween break pop-up clinics for 12 to 15-year-olds got under way - data on this group is expected to go live this week.\nBut it was one of the busiest weekends of the year for hospitals and the ambulance service.\nAs of Sunday morning, 500 people were waiting in emergency departments - almost 200 for more than 12 hours.\nA source at the ambulance service said Saturday was one of the \"hardest and busiest shifts\" they had ever worked.\nAbout 90% of ambulance turnaround times were longer than the standard 30-minute wait.  \nA spokesperson said NIAS continued to work with colleagues in the health service \"to find a sustainable solution to the issue of ambulance turnaround times\", but current pressures are \"such that the current situation is likely to continue\".\nNIAS said it would seek to ensure that the most seriously ill or injured \"receive the quickest and most appropriate response\", but that would mean those with \"less urgent clinical needs may face longer waits for ambulance response, for which we would apologise in advance\". \nIn the Republic of Ireland, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has authorised the use of booster jabs for healthcare workers.\nThey will begin to be administered at the weekend.\nHe said this followed advice he had received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC)."

      "text": "Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules.\nBy 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target.\nAn expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. \nAny commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. \nNet zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere.\nFirms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise.\nAnd although the plans will need to be published, the government said \"the aim is to increase transparency and accountability\" and the UK was not \"making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory\".\nThe market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said.\nSpeaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the \"first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre\".\nHe said the changes would mean: \"Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards.\"\nIn total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (\u00a395tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nHowever, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were \"doomed to fail\".\n\"Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. \n\"However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,\" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness.\nDavid Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still \"pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects.\"\nMark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear.\n\"None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,\" he said.\nShaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. \n\"Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,\" he said.\nHowever, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C.\nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (\u00a395trn) of private capital \"is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero\".\nIn practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes.\nBank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. \nUnder the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023.\nThe strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there.\nA taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based \"gold standard\" for the plans in order to guard against so-called \"greenwashing\" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance.\nHowever, the government said there was \"not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (\u00a3720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. \nAlison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying \"transparency was critical\".\nShe said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry \"to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers\".\nBut Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were \"real business opportunities\" in \"adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices\".\nKay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a \"valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation\". \n\"It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,\" she added.  \nAnd Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would \"spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business\".\nFollow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C.\nThis means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from \"brown holdings\" of investments in coal, oil and gas. \nBut can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. \nBy changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord."

      "tags": "Narendra Modi,COP26,Climate change,India",
      "text": "India has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070 - missing a key goal of the COP26 summit for countries to commit to reach that target by 2050.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi made the pledge, the first time India has set a net zero target, at the Glasgow summit.\nNet zero, or becoming carbon neutral, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nChina has announced plans for carbon neutrality by 2060, while the US and EU aim to hit net zero by 2050.\nThe Indian leader is one of more than 120 leaders to have gathered in Glasgow for the two-week conference. \nDozens gave speeches on Monday laying out goals to tackle the climate crisis, including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, US President Joe Biden and UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\nPresident Biden said that every day the world delayed in tackling climate change, the cost of inaction increased.\nBut he told delegates that the fight against global warming offered incredible opportunities for world economies.\nIndia is the world's fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the US and the EU.\nBut its huge population means its emissions per capita are much lower than other major world economies. India emitted 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per head of population in 2019, compared with 15.5 tonnes for the US and 12.5 tonnes for Russia that year.\nMr Modi made the pledge as one of five commitments from his country.\nThey include a promise for India to get 50% of its energy from renewable resources by 2030, and by the same year to reduce total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes.\nWhile the 2070 net zero target may have disappointed activists and experts in Glasgow, Mr Modi seems to have impressed people back home. \nIndia had \"clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world\" by announcing 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil electricity capacity, half of energy from renewables, a reduction of emissions by one billion tonnes and emissions intensity of the GDP by 45% by 2030, according to Arunabha Ghosh, Chief Executive Officer of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a leading climate think tank. \n\"This is real climate action. Now India demands $1tn (\u00a3722bn) in climate finance as soon as possible and will monitor not just climate action but also climate finance,\" Dr Ghosh said.\nThe BBC's Vikas Pandey reports that the prime minister appears to have found the middle ground for his base - he is seen as being serious about climate change but without compromising India's economic potential.\nMost headlines are using words like \"big\" and \"major\" to describe the announcement, our correspondent reports.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi used most of his time in front of his fellow world leaders to underline the need for lifestyle changes as the greatest solution to climate change. \nBut Mr Modi saved his biggest news to the last minute. \nDetailing what he termed were India's \"five elixirs\" for climate, Mr Modi announced that his country would adopt a net zero emissions target - by 2070.\nThis is quite a significant step for the world's third largest emitter, still getting more than 50% of the country's electricity from coal.\nIt has to be tempered by the fact that the date is far past the mid-century goal for carbon neutrality that scientists say is necessary to avert the most dangerous levels of warming.\nBut there has been a general welcome for the goal.\nMr Modi's address came after a strongly worded speech from UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Demanding that people stop \"treating nature like a toilet\" he sharply criticised continued use of fossil fuels, saying \"we are digging our own graves\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said future generations \"will judge us with bitterness\" if they failed at the conference, while US President Joe Biden said that \"none of us can escape the worst of what's yet to come if we fail to seize this moment\".\nBut outside the conference on the streets of Scotland's largest city, activists and protesters demanded more from global leaders. \nTeenage campaigner Greta Thunberg told a crowd of demonstrators that politicians at the summit are \"pretending to take our future seriously\".\n\"Change is not going to come from inside there. That is not leadership. This is leadership. This is what leadership looks like,\" she said to cheers."

      "text": "Elon Musk says no contract has been signed with Hertz after the rental car company announced a deal that led to Tesla's market value surpassing $1 trillion.\nLast week, shares in Tesla jumped 12.6% after Hertz said it had ordered 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2022.\nHowever, Mr Musk tweeted: \"I'd like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.\"\nYet Hertz told the BBC: \"Deliveries of the Teslas already have started.\"\nA spokeswoman said: \"As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV (electric vehicle) charging infrastructure across the company's global operations.\"\nHertz refused to confirm if a contract had or had not been signed with Tesla in light of Mr Musk's tweet, adding it did not discuss details of its business relationships or discussions.\nTesla has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.\nThe deal announced last week by Hertz with Tesla was the biggest-ever rental car order for electric vehicles.\n\"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" said Hertz interim boss Mark Fields.\nIt was reported Hertz would pay $4.2bn for 100,000 Model 3s over the next 14 months, which amounts to about a fifth of its fleet. The rental firm would also build a network of charging stations.\nHertz said that \"beginning in early November and expanding through year end\" customers would be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz airport and neighbourhood locations at certain areas in the US and Europe.  \nBut on Monday, Tesla boss Mr Musk tweeted: \"Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers.\n\"Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.\"\nTesla became the fifth company to surpass a market value of $1 trillion on 25 October, behind Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet.\nIn response to a tweet about the Hertz deal on 25 October, Mr Musk said it was \"strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem\".\nHe later added: \"To be clear, cars sold to Hertz have no discount. Same price as to consumers.\"\nTesla shares have been trading down more than 4% in pre-market trading in the US.\nIt is not the first time that Mr Musk's tweets regarding his company have made the news.\nIn May 2020, he wiped $14bn (\u00a311bn) off the carmaker's value after tweeting its share price was too high.\nAnd two years earlier, a tweet about Tesla's future on the New York stock market led to regulators fining the company $20m and Mr Musk agreeing to have all further posts on the platform pre-screened by lawyers.\nTesla announced on Tuesday it was launching a pilot of 10 \"supercharger\" stations in the Netherlands, which will be available to all electric vehicle models.\nAs part of its charging network expansion plans, the company said opening up its charging sites to non-Telsa drivers was \"critical for large-scale EV adoption\".\nTesla has also been forced to recall 11,704 vehicles over a software problem that could cause \"false forward-collision warnings and/or automatic emergency brake  events\".\nA US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notice said it was \"not aware of any crashes or injuries\" because of this problem. Tesla is fixing the problem with a software update.\nWhy is Elon Musk playing down talk of a deal with Hertz to sell 100,000 cars? After all, it sounds positive - and appeared to send the share price soaring. \nFirstly, such a deal might actually be better news for Hertz than Tesla. \nThe car rental firm recently emerged from bankruptcy protection and wants to portray itself as a go-getting modern company. Running Teslas fits the bill. \nBut Tesla doesn't really need Hertz.  \nIt's making cars as fast as it can, and insists there is no shortage of demand. Rental firms often buy surplus stock at a discount, but Mr Musk has made it clear if Hertz wants his cars it'll have to pay full price. \nMeanwhile, the Tesla boss has an uneasy relationship with market regulators. \nHis public insistence that a deal with Hertz \"has zero effect on our economics\", and that no contract has yet been signed could be seen as a message that if Tesla's valuation is rocketing - increasing his personal wealth in the process - it isn't because of anything he has said.

      "tags": "NI Health,Long Covid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The first dedicated assessment and treatment clinics for patients with long Covid have been launched across Northern Ireland. \nPatients are to be given advice on managing the condition and referred to other services where necessary.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said establishing the clinics had been a priority.\nOn Friday, officials had warned the service would be delayed until the end of November. \nThe assessment clinics were initially meant to be in place by the end of October. \nBut on Monday morning it was announced that they would be accepting referrals immediately across all health trust areas. \nPatients must be referred to a clinic either by their GP or by a hospital consultant.\nIf a patient's GP considers their symptoms to be a result of long Covid it will not matter whether or not they have previously tested positive for the virus. \nMr Swann said people suffering from long-term effects of Covid-19 will be offered treatment including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and nursing.\n\"The clinics will allow people to have a comprehensive assessment of their condition and will help them access the services and expert advice they need to support them in their recovery,\" he said.\nThe minister said work was \"well advanced\" on further services for long Covid sufferers, including a pulmonary rehabilitation and dysfunctional breathing service for those with significant respiratory symptoms after contracting the virus. \n\"I will continue to review services on an ongoing basis to ensure the best possible help and advice is available for those suffering from post Covid-19 symptoms,\" he added. \nAbout 20,000 people in Northern Ireland have been waiting patiently for this news.\nThe figure is an estimate as there are no official statistics for the number actually affected. \nThat's a problem in itself as no one actually knows how many patient care plans need to be developed and how many specialist staff are required to treat them. \nThe service, which is only in its infancy, has a lot to live up to. \nMany with long Covid cannot return to work or live a normal life and many say they feel abandoned and that their patience has run out. \nTheir symptoms - including fatigue, joint pain and brain fog - do not come with quick-fix treatments. \nInstead rehabilitation will take time and will have to be provided by specialist staff.  \nThe problem is that this is another essential service in a system that is already stretched to the limit. \nAt this stage I am curious to know how these clinics will be staffed and just how long will people have to wait to be seen.\nThis could be another challenge for the Department of Health-  as according to some patients they've already been waiting too long.  \nLong Covid clinics were opened across England in November 2020.\nIn the UK, long Covid is broadly defined as a condition that develops during or after the initial Covid-19 infection; continues for more than 12 weeks; and its symptoms cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.\nMore than 200 symptoms have been linked to the illness but some of the main symptoms are extreme fatigue, breathlessness, brain fog (neurological and memory loss), heart problems and severe headaches."

      "tags": "Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "The man behind a global warming stripe graphic said he's going to need more colours to represent future years in a warmer world.\nFrom London Fashion Week to BBC News branding, Prof Ed Hawkins' visualisation has become an international symbol of climate change.\nEach line represents the average temperature for a year - blue for colder years and red for warmer. \nColours will just get darker, he said.\nProf Hawkins said choices made at COP26, the climate summit in Glasgow, will determine how dark the colours get.\nThe graphic was first used by the Reading University academic at the Hay Festival in 2018.\nHe said: \"I was looking for a way of very simply communicating the fact that our planet is warming and so I made a set of stripes for Hay.\n\"I could instantly see that members of the audience realised that something was happening and they could instantly visualise the fact that the planet was warming and that was affecting Hay itself.\"\nThe colourful representation of temperature changes is now available for every country around the world.\nUsing the sequence for Wales from 1884 to present day, the colours gradually change from blues, to oranges, to dark reds.\nThe hottest years were in the past 30 years. \n\"This is a signal of our warming world,\" said Prof Hawkins.\n\"This data is critical for policy-makers making decisions. It tells us that Wales has warmed about one-and-a-half times faster than the global average.\n\"So for every two degrees [Celsius] that the global temperature increases, Wales will increase by about three degrees in temperature.\"\nThe stripes' climate history plays a key role in working out what's next for global warming.\nProfessor of paleoclimatology, Joy Singarayer, said studying the past is important to understanding the future.\nSo, as temperatures and CO2 levels have been higher historically, why are there concerns this time around?\nShe said: \"It's not due to natural variations in our orbits, in solar cycles or in volcanic eruptions and so on.\"\nProf Singarayer said it's humans causing the changes.\n\"In Wales for example we can see evidence of that, from glacial valleys that have been scoured out by ice sheets to other evidence on the landscape of as warm, or warmer than present temperatures,\" she said.\nFall Bay, on the Gower, near Swansea, shows evidence higher temperatures in the past.\nThe shells of sea creatures and pebbles shows the sea level from 125,000 years ago - up to nine metres higher than it currently is.\nProf Singarayer says an extreme series of circumstances could result in water raising to similar levels in the future.\n\"We think we might see half a metre or a metre sea level rise by the end of the century, depending on our carbon emissions and most of that currently is due to ocean thermal expansion so as the world is getting warmer, the oceans are also getting warmer and so the volume of those is increasing,\" she said.\n\"But there's potential for ice melts in the future, from Greenland and Antarctica in particular and that will contribute to rising sea levels.\n\"We think that happened in the past. So that is part of the reason why we see those raised beaches there.\n\"In a kind of drastic climate change scenario where we don't reduce our carbon emissions, something like that may well be possible in several 100 years' time. And the difference from that past scenario is that climate change is undeniably being caused by us now.\"\nThere is a limited time to act if the world is to stave off the worst effects of global warming, she said.\nInterpreting the past plays a crucial role as we live through what could be a turning point in the future of the climate change."
