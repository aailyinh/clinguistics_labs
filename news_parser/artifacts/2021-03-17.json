      "text": "A \"once-in-a-generation modernisation\" of the armed forces is required to extend British influence and protect the public, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe prime minister told MPs a new four-year funding deal would protect \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs and create 40,000 new roles.\n\"I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,\" he said.\nLabour welcomed more defence spending but asked how it would be funded.\nOutlining the new package in the Commons, the PM - speaking over video link as he is self-isolating - said the benefits \"will go far beyond our armed forces\".\nMr Johnson described the increase in defence spending as being worth \u00a316.5bn in new money over four years.\nHowever economist Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said that while this represented a big rise in spending, the figure of \u00a316.5bn was a \"misleading way to present this announcement\".\nHe continued: \"It would be more accurate to say that by 2024-25, defence spending will be \u00a37bn higher than it would have been under previous plans.\"\nMr Johnson said: \"Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe.\"\nThe PM pledged to end defence budget cuts, protect shipping lanes that supply the country, press on with renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent and restore Britain as \"the foremost naval power in Europe\" with a \"renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK\".\nHe also said the funding would allow investment in new technology such as:\n\"From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year - 40,000 in total - levelling-up across our country and reinforcing our union,\" Mr Johnson added. \nThis is a big win for Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who's been fighting hard for a significant increase in defence spending and a long-term financial settlement to end what he calls a cycle of overambitious, under-funded defence reviews of the past.  \nThe Treasury had been arguing for a much smaller annual increase. But Mr Wallace found an ally in the PM, who says his first priority is defence of the realm. \nBoris Johnson also believes it'll boost Britain's place in the world and create jobs.  \nThe extra money will be used to modernise the armed forces with more spent on robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber. \nDespite the palpable relief inside the MoD it still has to fill a \u00a313bn black hole in its equipment budget. Difficult decisions about cutting old equipment to fund the new are still to be made. \nThe MoD, which doesn't have a strong track record of balancing its books, now has to prove it can spend wisely. \nAnd good news for defence might also mean bad news for other government departments - there's already speculation the international aid budget could be cut.   \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of making a \"spending announcement without a strategy\" and asked whether the money would be raised through cuts or tax rises, or both.\nMr Johnson did not respond to the question but said Sir Keir's record of support for the armed forces was \"very thin indeed\".\nFormer foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Mr Johnson \"not to listen to any voices in his ear\" saying that cutting international aid could help to fund the increase in defence spending.\nAnd Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the international development committee, asked Mr Johnson to \"quash rumours and confirm his manifesto commitment\" of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, \"now and going forwards\".\nThe PM responded by telling the Commons: \"I think we can all be proud of our record on overseas aid and that will continue.\"\nGen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said he was \"absolutely delighted\" by the announcement.\n\"But of course we're also conscious that living through this Covid crisis, the armed forces have stepped up to the plate to provide some of the resilience that the nation has needed,\" he added.\nEarlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said \"letting go\" of some older weapons would create \"headroom\" for new investment.\nHe added: \"When I looked across at the armed forces today I saw them with equipment that was out-of-date, I saw our adversaries across the world having better equipment, the ability to attack us and harm us getting wider and wider from our capabilities.\"\nThe funding announcement is part of the first conclusions of the government's Integrated Review which looks at security, defence, development and foreign policy.\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the extra money would give \"a welcome and long-overdue upgrade to Britain's defences after a decade of decline\".\nConservative MP and defence select committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said: \"This is a lot of money but ultimately there are still huge financial pressures facing our armed forces.\"\nBut he said the \"key takeaway\" for him was the \"message this sends to the British people, to the MoD as well, that we want to be back as a strong power capability\"."

      "text": "Northern Ireland Executive ministers have agreed to lift more Covid-19 public health restrictions this week, allowing theatre and concert venues to reopen.\nThe rules on live music and the number of people who are allowed to meet in a private home are also being eased.\nMinisters have been gradually lifting restrictions in the past few months, following the strict lockdown they imposed across Northern Ireland after Christmas 2020.\nHowever, a recent surge in infection rates and the resulting pressure on hospital admissions mean some restriction remain in place for now. \nBBC News NI explains the latest rules on socialising, travel, face coverings and other areas.\nYes. On Monday, ministers agreed that a total of 10 people from three households would now be allowed to meet inside a home.\nChildren under 12 do not count towards the total.\nPreviously, the limit was six people from two households (or 10 people if one household was bigger than six people).\nOvernight stays have been allowed for some time.\nYes, and the numbers allowed to enter have been gradually increasing. \nFrom Monday 26 July, a maximum of 15 people from an unlimited number of households are able to meet in a private garden.\nAgain, children aged 12 and under do not count towards this limit. \nYes, you can.\nA traffic light system for international travel came into force on 24 May, with a limited number of countries on the green list meaning people arriving in Northern Ireland from those areas were exempt from quarantine.\nWith the expanded vaccination rollout, more significant changes took effect on 19 July.\nNew rules came into force on that date which meant travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from amber countries (except France) were able to avoid quarantine if they had received both their Covid-19 vaccines in the UK. \nThese passengers still need to produce evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before departure and take a PCR test on day two after arrival.\nThere are exemptions for some including children under 18, those medically advised against vaccination and clinical trial participants.\nOn Thursday 29 July, the NI Executive announced that people who have been fully vaccinated in the EU (except France) or the US will not need to isolate when coming to Northern Ireland. \nThe move, from Monday 2 August, brings Northern Ireland in line with England, Scotland and Wales.\nThere are also no limits on travel to other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).\nOn 24 May, the Northern Ireland Executive lifted its guidance on self-isolating after travelling to another part of the CTA.\nTesting is still advised after arriving back in Northern Ireland from another part of the CTA but it is guidance only.\nYes, live music resumed from 5 July with a number of restrictions, but these rules are in the process of being eased.\nStormont ministers have now agreed that concert venues and theatres can reopen from 18:00 BST on Tuesday 27 July.\nBut the venues must sell tickets in advance of performance, they must have allocated seating and ensure social distancing of at least 1m (3ft).\nVolume restrictions on live indoor music which were in force from 5- 26 July have now been lifted.  \nHowever, dancing is not permitted and this restriction is not due to be reconsidered by ministers before 12 August.\nNightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed at present. \nAlthough Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the legal requirement to use face coverings in England from 19 July, that change did not apply in Northern Ireland.\nMasks have been mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland since July 2020 and in shops since August 2020, with a limited number of exemptions.\nBut from 26 July, people attending indoor religious services in Northern Ireland will no longer have to wear a face covering during the service.\nHowever, it is still be a legal requirement to wear face masks when entering and exiting the building, and guidance will recommend that worshipers keep their masks on during services. \nFace coverings remain compulsory in other settings, including:\nIt's a more complicated picture.\nThe executive says from 26 July, where it's still the law to socially distance - such as restaurants and workplaces - the limit will be reduced to 1m for indoors activities.\nThe 1m rule was then extended to include retail and shopping centres.\nIt will be removed for all outdoor activities from law but guidance will be that social distancing is recommended at 1m (3ft) where possible.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan recently said more significant changes were coming and that he hoped the executive could agree on 12 August to put in place a date to end social distancing in law.\nThat meeting could also see ministers discuss lifting the remaining restrictions on hospitality, such as the numbers of people allowed to sit at a table together.\nThese ceremonies have been continuing with restrictions through the latest lockdown, but from 24 May, post-wedding and civil partnership receptions were allowed to resume.\nHowever, mitigations remain in place including:\nFrom 26 July, normal services resumed at MoT centres.\nDuring MoT examinations, a vehicle can be shared by the driver and the examiner for five minutes if both wear a mask. \nCustomers will be permitted to be seated safely for eight minutes and must remaining socially-distanced and wear a mask.\nThe executive said that was to allow customers to be present in testing halls and take their vehicle through the process with examiners.\nOn the same date - 26 July - other close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons do not need clients to book ahead for appointments first and overlapping appointments will also be allowed.\nQuite possibly, but do not expect Northern Ireland's rules to directly match the timeline in other parts of the UK.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive can change the restrictions regularly in line with new public health advice and said it is conscious of the pace of change in other jurisdictions.\nIt has said its decisions have been taken in a \"local context\".\nThe executive's planned meeting on 12 August will look at the requirements for face coverings and self-isolation as well as its guidance around working from home and relaxing restrictions on meeting at home.\nThat day could see ministers agree a date to end some of the measures that have dominated lives and livelihoods since last March.\nBut as ever, putting that in place requires support from the executive's five parties.\nAchieving political consensus on how and when to end restrictions remains challenging to navigate."

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,UK defence spending,Boris Johnson,Ministry of Defence,Ben Wallace",
      "text": "The British army is already the smallest it's been in 400 years. And it's about to get even smaller.\nA cut in the number of troops is expected in a defence review, due to be published next month.\nOptions include losing up to 10,000 soldiers from the regular Army's notional strength of 82,000 in order to help fund its modernisation. \nMinisters have made clear there will still have to be painful decisions for the armed forces, despite the extra \u00a316.5bn given to the Ministry of Defence over the next four years.\nA senior Army officer has told the BBC that technology will allow the Army to become \"leaner and more agile\". \nBut it comes amid warnings that the Army is already too small, and that more cuts will worry allies and limit its ability to fight.\nOver the past year the Army has been preparing for a radical transformation. \nIt wants to embrace new technologies - from drones and robots to artificial intelligence. \nBrig John Clark, the head of Army strategy, insists no decision on troop numbers has yet been made. \nBut he says by harnessing technology \"you're able to achieve the same effect with fewer people\".\nHowever, Jack Watling, of London's Royal United Services Institute warns of \"the excitement of new capabilities coming at the expense of traditional hard military power\". \nRemember, the majority of soldiers in a modern army are there to support and sustain a fighting force. \nThe tip of the spear, the combat element, is often about a third of an army's total strength. \nThe rumours in Whitehall suggest the Army will be losing several infantry battalions, part of the fighting force.\nMr Watling says an army of just 72,000 should still be able to take and hold \"a small town\", bearing in mind the British army struggled to secure the Iraqi city of Basra, when it was 100,000 strong.\nIt might appear to be a contradiction, but the Army believes even if it's smaller, it can still have a bigger presence around the world. \nIt's embraced the government's mantra of \"global Britain\".  \nFor the Army it'll mean operating from a number of \"global hubs\" in parts of the world where it already has a presence - such as Kenya, Oman and Brunei. \nBrig Clark says: \"We see those as launchpads through which we can routinely send more of the British army out to train, develop and demonstrate.\"\nHe says by being forward-deployed the Army will be able to respond and manage threats \"more rapidly and decisively\". \nHe describes it as prevention rather than cure.\nIt signals a shift in the way the Army wants to operate. \nBrig Clark talks of \"smaller teams that can go out there and compete beneath the threshold of conflict\" - the so-called \"grey zone\" where militaries operate discreetly in the blurred lines between war and peace.\nBen Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: \"I see a clear aspiration to do more with the Army further away, but forces cannot be everywhere at once.\"\nThere are certainly questions as to whether a smaller army, spread around the world, will be able to meet its existing commitments to Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). \nIn theory, the UK can deploy a war fighting division to defend Europe.  \nMr Watling of Rusi says among the components of a division would be around 200 main battle tanks. \nThe British army is likely to have half that number.\nMr Barry, of the IISS, says allies in eastern Europe are left wondering whether the British army of the future will be sending \"armour and infantry or aggressive algorithms\" to help defend them.\nThe Army's plans do include updating increasingly obsolete armoured vehicles and the addition of more potent long-range artillery systems. \nBrig Clark insists the Army will still be able to field a warfighting division. \nBut the Army's definition of a division appears to be changing.\nThe UK already has one of the smallest armies of any major European nation. \nAnd that worries its closest military ally, the United States. \nUS General Mark Milley's plea to the British army at a London conference just a few years ago was that \"you don't get any smaller\". \nKim Darroch, the former British ambassador to Washington, recently said the message from the Pentagon was \"\u2026do not go down any further and expect to retain your current credibility\".\nThe truth is that the British Army's credibility had already been damaged in the eyes of the US. \nAmerica had to come to the rescue of the British army in both Iraq and Afghanistan. \nMr Barry and Mr Watling also question whether an army of 72,000 could do another Helmand - a long, enduring campaign.\nBrig Clark insists it could.  \nBut the British army has a recent history of biting off more than it can chew."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe, the health secretary has said, after some European nations paused its use amid concern over blood clots.\nMatt Hancock urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\" as soon as they got the opportunity.\nSome 13 countries have suspended use of the vaccine while they seek further clarification on its safety.\nBut the UK's medicines watchdog, the MHRA, has said that evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots.\nThe EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of blood clots in vaccinated people on Thursday. \nHowever, it said previously that it was still \"firmly convinced\" the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine outweighed the risks and there was \"no indication\" the jab causes blood clots. \nAbout 17 million people across the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week, the manufacturer AstraZeneca said.\nIt said the number of cases of blood clots reported was lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population.\nIn a bid to reassure the British public, Mr Hancock stressed that the MHRA, the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency all believed the vaccine was safe.\n\"We keep the effects of these vaccines under review all the time and we know that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is saving lives in the UK right now so if you get the call, get the jab,\" he said. \nAsked if there had been evidence of people declining the jab after the European suspensions, the health secretary said there were still \"huge numbers of people vaccinated every day\" and that \"enthusiasm for getting the vaccine is incredibly strong\".\nDowning Street has also defended the safety of the vaccine, with the PM's official spokesman insisting that Boris Johnson would be happy to take it when it came to his turn.\nMeanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall revealed on Tuesday that she had received the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab earlier this year.\nSpeaking during a visit to a pop-up vaccination centre in London with the Prince of Wales, Camilla joked that it \"didn't matter\" which jab she was given because \"I hate injections so much\".\nIt was announced in mid-February that Prince Charles, 72, and the duchess, 73, had received their first Covid jabs. Their ages meant they were included in the fourth priority group for the rollout of the vaccine.\nThe latest government figures show that 24,839,906 first doses of a Covid vaccine have now been given in the UK, with some 1,663,646 people receiving a second dose.\nCountries across Europe are seeking further clarity on the jab's safety, amid criticism of their decision to suspend its use.\nDenmark was first to pause its use of the vaccine, followed by Norway and Iceland. Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Spain, Latvia and Sweden are the latest to follow suit.\nGermany, France and Italy have said they are awaiting the outcome of the EMA investigation.\nThey said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the jab, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer it.\nDr Phil Bryan, vaccines safety lead at the MHRA, said that people \"should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so\".\n\"We are closely reviewing reports but given the large number of doses administered, and the frequency at which blood clots can occur naturally, the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause.\"\nThe WHO, which is also investigating the reports, says there is no evidence that the clots were linked to the vaccine and it has urged countries not to pause their vaccination programmes.\nProf Jeremy Brown, a member of the UK government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said concerns about blood clots were \"overblown\" as they were unlikely to be linked to the jab. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme pausing its use would cause more illness and deaths than would be prevented \"by the unlikely situation that there's an increased risk of a very rare event occurring as a consequence of the vaccine\". \nSir Kent Woods, former chief executive of the MHRA and former chair of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast there would have been a \"denting of public confidence because of the disorderly situation in Europe\" and by suspending the use of the jab countries were \"increasing the risk to the population\". \nDr Jess Harvey, a GP in Shropshire, said she had received several calls from patients concerned about the possibility of blood clots linked to the vaccine. \nShe said she had not had any appointments cancelled yet but was worried about no-shows. \nMeanwhile, Public Health England said on Tuesday that it was investigating a new coronavirus variant previously reported by the Philippines, after two cases were identified in England. \nIt said one case was linked with international travel, while the other was still under investigation.\nPHE also said that two cases of the P.1 variant of concern first found in Brazil had been identified in England - with one in the West Midlands and another in Haringey, London.\nThis variant has a mutation - known as E484 - that means it can escape some of the immune response, which may mean vaccines work less effectively against it.\nBoth cases were linked with international travel to Brazil, PHE said, and bring the total number of UK cases of the variant to 12."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS has warned of a \"significant reduction in the weekly supply\" of Covid vaccines in England next month in a letter to local health organisations.\nThe letter says there has been a \"reduction in national inbound vaccines supply\" and asks organisations to \"ensure no further appointments are uploaded\" to booking systems in April.\nThe health secretary said it was a \"standard\" letter.\nThe BBC understands no-one who has booked a vaccine should lose a slot. \nAsked about it during a Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said the NHS regularly sent out \"technical letters\" that explained the \"ups and downs\" of supply.\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there would be fewer AstraZeneca vaccines than expected because of issues with the company's international supply. \nBBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood that the vaccine supply issue related to a consignment from a manufacturer in India, with half of the order delayed by four weeks.\nA spokesperson for the AstraZeneca said: \"Our UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule.\" \nWe were always warned supply was fragile - and these developments are a reminder of that.\nThe UK has its own plants that are supplying one to two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine each week. \nThere are also stocks coming from Pfizer's Belgium plant - these would be the ones that would be susceptible to any restrictions on exports the EU is threatening.\nThe Indian supplies were supposed to give the UK the \"bumper\" end to March, allowing the government to push ahead with vaccination of the under-50s within weeks.\nThis has now been put on hold, given significant numbers will need their second doses from the start of next month.\nThe government is still on track to hit its target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July. \nBy late Spring the first doses of Moderna - the third vaccine to have been approved in the UK - should start arriving.\nBut the delay to the second shipment from India means rollout is going to take a little longer than hoped at the start of this week.\nThe letter from the NHS in England says that \"over this next period it is vital\" that health organisations focus on vaccinating those in the priority groups one to nine, who are most vulnerable to coronavirus. \nIt advises vaccination services to work with local authorities, voluntary community and faith organisations \"to put in place reserve lists\" of people eligible for the vaccine - as well as targeting areas of lower uptake. \nThe NHS says vaccination centres and community pharmacy-led services should close unfilled bookings from the week commencing 29 March.\nEarlier, it was announced that almost half of British adults have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - more than 25 million people.\nAround 1.7 million people have also had a second dose.\nDuring Wednesday's briefing, Mr Hancock said the UK was \"ahead of schedule\" to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April.\nHe also reiterated a commitment to ensuring that all adults in the UK are offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\nSpeaking alongside the health secretary, Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said \"every day we vaccinate more people we are preventing more deaths\".\nAnd England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was \"no evidence\" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine causes an \"increased risk\" of blood clots.\nThe EU's medicines regulator has said it remains \"firmly convinced\" that the benefits of the  jab outweigh the risks, after several leading EU states paused their rollouts.\nProf Van-Tam added that all medicines have both side effects and benefits, and listed some of the rare side effects of paracetamol as examples, pointing out that most people had no issue with taking it.\nBBC politics correspondent Jonathan Blake said the hold-up would have an impact on the momentum of the vaccine rollout and possibly the government's targets.\nLabour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that people \"across the country\" would be \"anxious and worried\" about the news of delays.\n\"Matt Hancock must explain what the issue is with supply and what efforts are being made to resolve them,\" he added.\nOn Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that if Covid vaccine supplies in Europe do not improve, the EU \"will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate\".\nThe EU and the UK have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the export of the vaccines, exacerbated by post-Brexit disagreements.\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Hancock confirmed that shielding guidance in England would end on 31 March - meaning that more than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard. A further 5,758 people have tested positive."

Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April.\nIn total, the number of people who have had one vaccine dose is:\nThe number of vaccines given this week in the UK is expected to top four million - nearly double what has been achieved per week recently - thanks to a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India.\nThis could mean all those aged 50 and over will be offered one dose by the end of March, putting the NHS rollout two weeks ahead of schedule.\nAfter that, the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated, with people prioritised by age. \nAll adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\nIt is 100 days since Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to be vaccinated against Covid outside of clinical trials.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"I'm determined no-one should miss out on the chance to protect themselves and urge everyone who is eligible to come forward.\"\nDr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS England's primary care director, said vaccine supplies would go up and down over the next few months linked to manufacturers' ability to supply their jabs.\n\"But this week and next we have larger supplies, so we want anyone in the top priority groups - people aged 50 and older as well as those working in health and care and anyone with an underlying health condition - to come forward soon to protect themselves and their loved ones,\" she said. \nTwo million text messages are being sent out to those aged 50-54 in England with a link allowing people to book an appointment through the national booking service website.\nPeople who cannot go online can call the service on 119.\nThe expansion of the Covid vaccine rollout comes after government reassurance that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - one of two being given to people in the UK - was safe, after 13 countries paused their use of it.\nExpect a surge in vaccinations in the next week or so. Extra supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine have arrived from abroad to supplement existing stocks.\nThe target to offer a vaccine to all those aged 50 and over by mid-April will almost certainly be met ahead of schedule. It will then be the turn of younger adults.\nThe progress means the UK is easing restrictions as parts of Europe face new waves of infection.\nConcerns have been raised about safety of the AstraZeneca jab - the European regulator is investigating cases of blood clots, focusing on a rare type that affects the brain.\nEvidence from 10 million doses given in the UK show there have been three cases - none fatal.\nThis is not above the level you would expect to happen normally, suggesting coincidence rather than cause. \nIn Germany the numbers are higher - but because these events are so rare, it's easy for a couple of cases to raise alarm.\nIt's understandable they are being investigated, but what has baffled experts is why some nations have paused rollout in the meantime.\nAfter all, this vaccine saves lives. That's why authorities here say it's safe and even the European regulator says vaccination should continue.  \nThe EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of rare blood clots in a tiny number of vaccinated people on Thursday.\nBut the UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, and Downing Street has said there is no evidence to suggest the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is linked to the clots.\nMr Hancock urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\" as soon as they got the opportunity.\nA vaccine safety panel of the World Health Organization said it was \"carefully assessing the latest available data\" for the vaccine but, in the meantime, recommended that vaccinations should continue.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard. A further 5,758 people tested positive."

      "text": "A woman who lost three stone (19kg) and had hallucinations while using topical steroids has called for more support for people reacting to skin treatments.\nTeacher Elin Wade, from Swansea, had bad reactions after using creams prescribed for an eczema flare-up.\nThe 29-year-old said she was made to feel like a \"fraud\" as topical steroid addiction is not recognised as an official condition by the NHS.\nThe Welsh government said serious reactions were \"uncommon\".\nAbout 10% of adults and 20% of children in the UK have eczema, with topical steroids considered a safe and effective way in most cases to manage it. \nThe creams and ointments come in various strengths, and are usually meant to be used in short courses.\nBut some people react badly to the creams, either while using them or when they stop - a condition which has become known as topical steroid addiction.\nSymptoms include hot red rashes, oozing, excessive skin shedding, cracked skin, severe itches, extremes of body temperature, swelling, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, mental health issues and insomnia.\nIn January the British Association of Dermatologists and the National Eczema Society published guidance acknowledging topical steroid withdrawal for the first time.\nIn February 2019, Ms Wade stopped using her steroid creams after she lost weight, had hallucinations and her hair fell out. \n\"I went from being a perfectly healthy 25-year-old woman to being a 29-year-old injecting incredibly potent drugs into my system just to get some sort of relief,\" she said.\nShe said it was \"exhausting\" and \"frustrating\" trying to tell doctors she believed the creams were driving her symptoms, and that she was made to feel like a \"fraud\".\n\"It's always been made very clear to me that I should be using topical steroids, that they don't cause addiction, they don't cause withdrawal and it's impossible to get addicted to them,\" she said.\n\"It's been so traumatic, the suffering is so intense, there's no way I'd put myself through this if I didn't see other people get better.\"\nMs Wade said she had been tested for HIV, lymphoma and leukaemia but she still did not have a diagnosis as the condition is not recognised.\n\"It'd just be a lot less stressful because you're suffering so much anyway, just to have somebody acknowledge that this is a condition that actually is happening,\" she added.\nLecturer Emily Banks, 30, from Cardiff, also decided to stop using topical steroids after the ointments she was prescribed stopped working.\nDesperate to find answers about why her skin was so bad, she made a \"cry for help\" on social media, sharing photos of her skin.\nShe said being disbelieved by doctors was \"really disheartening when you're in pain and you just want help\".\nGeorge Moncrieff, a GP in Oxfordshire, said he \"couldn't imagine practicing medicine\" without topical steroids.\nThe former chairman of the Dermatology Council of England believes they are so integral to the treatment of skin conditions, sometimes the medical community \"don't want to hear bad news\" about adverse reactions to them.\nDr Moncrieff said because some patients were reluctant to use topical steroids in the first place - so-called \"steroid-phobia\" - doctors can sometimes assume people with genuine concerns about bad reactions to steroid creams could be ignored.\n\"If doctors think something's uncommon they don't recognise it and they don't discuss it. It's therefore never diagnosed and it continues to be assumed to be uncommon,\" he added.\nResearch suggests the average medical school offers about two weeks of dermatology training during six years of study, while nine out of 10 patients with skin issues were not seen by a skin specialist.\nJulie Keeley from the Welsh council of the Royal College of GPs said patients should not be afraid to consult their doctor if they were worried they had signs of the condition, and to ask for the second opinion of a dermatology specialist if necessary.\nBut she also said GPs needed more specialist training on skin so they could distinguish the signs between normal skin conditions that will respond to steroid creams, and topical steroid addiction.\n\"I think it's a good way forward to have more education for dermatology based in Wales and more readily available to healthcare professionals,\" she added.\n\"And also integrating it more into the medical school curriculum so people have a better awareness of these conditions.\"\nThe author of the new guidance, Celia Moss, said labels like \"topical steroid addiction\" and \"red skin syndrome\" were not helpful for doctors because they are not recognised medical terms.\nHer work breaks down topical steroid withdrawal into recognisable and treatable diagnoses for doctors.\nShe said she hoped it would go some way to ending the \"friction\" and  \"open up channels of communication\" between doctors and patients.\nDr Moss also wants to see better labelling of steroid creams so doctors and patients understand how strong they are and how they should be used.\nThe Welsh government said topical steroids played an important role in the treatment of some conditions, but longer-term use should be monitored carefully.\n\"More significant reactions following withdrawal of topical steroids are relatively uncommon, however anyone concerned about side effects should discuss this with their doctor,\" a spokeswoman said."

      "tags": "John Magufuli,Tanzania",
      "text": "Tanzania's President John Magufuli has died aged 61, the country's vice-president has announced.\nHe died on Wednesday from heart complications at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, Samia Suluhu Hassan said in an address on state television.\nMr Magufuli had not been seen in public for more than two weeks, and rumours had been circulating about his health.\nOpposition politicians said last week that he had contracted Covid-19, but this has not been confirmed.\nMr Magufuli was one of Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptics, and called for prayers and herbal-infused steam therapy to counter the virus.\n\"It is with deep regret that I inform you that today... we lost our brave leader, the president of the Republic of Tanzania, John Pombe Magufuli,\" Vice-President Hassan said in the announcement.\nShe said there would be 14 days of national mourning and flags would fly at half mast.\nAccording to Tanzania's constitution, Ms Hassan will be sworn in as the new president within 24 hours and should serve the remainder of Mr Magufuli's five-year term which he began last year.\nMr Magufuli was last seen in public on 27 February, but Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa insisted last week that the president was \"healthy and working hard\".\nHe blamed the rumours of the president's ill-health on \"hateful\" Tanzanians living abroad.\nBut opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that his sources had told him Mr Magufuli was being treated in hospital for coronavirus in Kenya.\nWhen Covid-19 arrived in Tanzania, Mr Magufuli called on people to go to churches and mosques to pray. \"Coronavirus, which is a devil, cannot survive in the body of Christ... It will burn instantly,\" he said. \nHe declared Tanzania \"Covid-19 free\" last June, saying the virus had been eradicated by three days of national prayer. \nHe also mocked the efficacy of masks, expressed doubts about testing, and teased neighbouring countries which imposed health measures to curb the virus.\n\"Countries in Africa will be coming here to buy food in the years to come\u2026 they will be suffering because of shutting down their economy,\" he said, according to the Associated Press. \nTanzania has not published details of its coronavirus cases since May, and the government has refused to purchase vaccines.\nOn Monday, police said they had arrested four people on suspicion of spreading rumours on social media that the president was ill.\n\"To spread rumours that he's sick smacks of hate,\" Mr Majaliwa said at the time.\nAnalysis by Athuman Mtulya, BBC News, Dar es Salaam\nThe country is in a sombre mood - for the first time in its six decades of existence, Tanzania has lost a sitting president, John Pombe Magufuli.\nThe news of his death was received with shock and disbelief - although there were rumours of his illness, the authorities reassured the country that all was well with him. \nFrom his home district of Chato to the capital of Dodoma to the business hub of Dar es Salaam, most Tanzanians have been mourning Magufuli. \nThere are those with a different view, especially on social media led by exiled opposition politician Tundu Lissu, who has been speculating that President Magufuli had contracted Covid which led to his death, however the authorities have insisted the death was caused by heart complications. \nTanzanians are now turning their minds to the succession, which should see current Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan become the country's first female president. \nMr Magufuli was declared president on his 56th birthday in October 2015. He was elected for a second term following a disputed poll last year.\nHe was hailed for his anti-corruption stance during his time in office, but he was also accused of cracking down on dissent and curtailing certain freedoms.\nHis critics agree that Mr Magufuli contributed to Tanzania's development. He invested in large infrastructure projects such as a standard-gauge railway to connect the country with its neighbours, major highways, and a bus system in the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam. \nHe also increased electricity production, reducing the need for power rationing.\nBut it is his approach to Covid-19 that many analysts say will define his legacy. \nIn Tanzania, people have reacted with grief and disbelief to the news of Mr Magufuli's death.\nOne, Joseph Petro, told the BBC he thought Mr Magufuli was a \"caring\" leader, adding \"he was helping people in one way or another\".\n\"I am really pained. I am personally pained,\" he said. \nAnother, Illuminata Abel, offered similar sentiments: \"He was not my relative, but he was someone who listened to people's problems, and he was down to earth.\"\nAfrican leaders have also come out to pay tribute.\nKenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said: \"I have lost a friend, colleague and visionary ally,\" and declared a seven-day period of national mourning in Kenya.\nFormer Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called Mr Magufuli a \"partner in democracy\" and a \"patriot who loved his country\".\nBut Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that Mr Magufuli's \"politics, policies and Covid denialism\" had \"driven the country towards disaster\"."

He left the ITV programme later that day.\nThe total of 57,121 complaints is 12,600 more than those made over a race row on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007.\nThe duchess herself is among those who have complained to the watchdog.\nMorgan responded on Twitter: \"Only 57,000? I've had more people than that come up & congratulate me in the street for what I said. The vast majority of Britons are right behind me.\"\nOfcom, which has regulated British TV since 2003, has already launched an investigation into Good Morning Britain. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman said the investigation was ongoing.\nA further 4,398 complaints have been made about the Oprah interview itself, which was broadcast on ITV on 8 March. Some objected to the duke and duchess' claims about the Royal Family, some about the timing given the Duke of Edinburgh's ill health, and some about the use of allegedly misleading press headlines in the programme.\nOfcom said: \"We're assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate.\" The regulator did not say which aspect of the interview had attracted the complaints.\nIn the in-depth interview, Meghan told Oprah her mental health became so bad she \"didn't want to be alive any more\", that she did not receive the help she asked for from Buckingham Palace, and that an unnamed member of the Royal Family had queried \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\nThe day after its UK broadcast, Morgan said he did not believe her, adding that \"the fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible\". \nHe briefly walked off the programme after clashing with weather presenter Alex Beresford, and he was criticised by mental health charity Mind.\nMorgan later conceded that it was \"not for me to question if she felt suicidal\", but has defended his \"right to be allowed to have an opinion\"."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance",
      "text": "Customers who pay too much to their energy supplier through their monthly direct debit payment should receive automatic annual refunds, Ofgem says.\nFor years, customers have complained that energy firms can hoard thousands of pounds of overpayments and would only return it on request.\nNow the regulator has proposed balances are cleared once a year, claiming suppliers held a surplus of \u00a31.4bn.\nIt said some were using the money for \"unsustainable business practices\".\nEnergy UK, which represents suppliers, said direct debits evened out bills even though domestic gas and electricity use varied considerably during the year.\nFor the millions of customers paying by direct debit, energy firms set a sum to be collected each month. The amount is based on predictions of how much gas and electricity will be used, taking previous records into account.\nOften the balances go into credit in the summer, when less energy is used, before moving back closer to parity during the colder months.\nHowever, meter readings may show that direct debits have been set too high, meaning a customer has consistently overpaid.\nThis can build up, in some cases, to thousands of pounds. In 2016, the BBC reported how one customer was shocked to discover that his energy supplier owed him \u00a33,049 - with similar complaints having been made for years.\nCurrent rules state the onus is on the customer to request a refund of the money. The process can take months.\nNow, Ofgem has proposed that, from next year, companies automatically refund customers on the anniversary of the start of payments or their contract.\nThat would mean a customer who signed up with a firm in April, for example, would see their excess balance the following April automatically refunded into their bank account.\nOfgem estimates that people would receive \u00a365 on average, under the latest calculations.\n\"These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers' money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers' money,\" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem.  \n\"This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship.\" \nThe regulator said it had evidence that excess payments were being used by some suppliers to prop up parts of the business that would otherwise be unsustainable.\nTo prevent firms simply increasing direct debits during a year, the regulator is proposing a threshold for these payments. The methodology will be discussed during consultation.\nAny customers who owe money at the end of the year will, as is currently the case, receive a catch-up bill or see regular direct debits increased over the following year.\nThe Energy Ombudsman received 1,000 complaints about credit balances last year.\n\"Just as people are expected to pay their energy bills on time, we think it's fair to expect energy suppliers to do the same with refunds,\" said Ed Dodman, director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman.\n\"We know from looking at complaints that suppliers can sometimes take too long to issue refunds, which can be stressful for consumers.\"\nOn behalf of suppliers, Energy UK said: \"Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year. \n\"Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem's proposals.\""

      "text": "A rare songbird has become so threatened that it has started to lose its song, say scientists. \nThe regent honeyeater, once abundant in south-eastern Australia, is now listed as critically endangered; just 300 individuals remain in the world.\n\"They don't get the chance to hang around with other honeyeaters and learn what they're supposed to sound like,\" explained Dr Ross Crates. \nHis findings are published in the UK Royal Society journal Proceedings B.\nDr Crates, a member of the Difficult Bird Research Group at the Australian National University in Canberra, is now trying to preserve the birds' song by teaching captive honeyeaters the songs of their wild relatives. \nThe researchers had not set out to study the song of the regent honeyeater, but simply to find the birds. \n\"They're so rare and the area they could occupy is so big - probably 10 times the size of the UK - that we were looking for a needle in a haystack,\" said Dr Crates. \nDuring this painstaking search, he started to notice birds that were \"singing weird songs\". \nHe recalled: \"They didn't sound anything like a regent honeyeater - they sounded like different species.\"\nSongbirds learn their songs the same way that humans learn how to speak. \n\"As young birds, when they leave the nest and go out into the big wide world, they need to associate with other, older males so they can listen to them sing and repeat that song over time,\" said Dr Crates.  \nThe regent honeyeater, which has lost about 90% of its habitat, now has such a small, sparsely distributed population that young males are simply unable to find other males and hear their songs. \n\"So they end up learning the songs of other species,\" Dr Crates explained. \nThe natural song of the regent honeyeater has essentially \"disappeared\" in 12% of the population, the research revealed. \nDr Sue Anne Zollinger, an expert in animal communication from Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, said the research demonstrated how songbirds need the chance to listen to and learn from others, \"the same way that human children need a rich linguistic experience when young in order to speak fluently as adults\". \n\"This study shows how damaging population declines and habitat fragmentation might be to this critical process in the life of songbirds,\" she commented. \nIn a note of conservation hope, the scientists are using their recordings of wild birds to teach captive honeyeaters their own song. \nThere is already a project to release captive-bred regent honeyeaters into the wild every few years, to boost the population. \n\"But if those male birds are singing a weird song, the females might not mate with them,\" explained Dr Crates. \"So we hope that if they hear what they should be singing, they will learn to sing it themselves.\"\nThe scientist added that, in trying to conserve species, we have to think of these \"cultural traits\" like birdsong and other natural behaviours that are essential for animals to survive and thrive in the wild.\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

There has been no change to this plan.\"\nHowever, the industry is warning thousands of weddings will have to be cancelled or postponed following this \"confusion\".\n\"The roadmap indicated weddings and receptions could resume on 12th April.

      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe, the health secretary has said, after some European nations paused its use amid concern over blood clots.\nMatt Hancock urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\" as soon as they got the opportunity.\nSome 13 countries have suspended use of the vaccine while they seek further clarification on its safety.\nBut the UK's medicines watchdog, the MHRA, has said that evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots.\nThe EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of blood clots in vaccinated people on Thursday. \nHowever, it said previously that it was still \"firmly convinced\" the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine outweighed the risks and there was \"no indication\" the jab causes blood clots. \nAbout 17 million people across the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week, the manufacturer AstraZeneca said.\nIt said the number of cases of blood clots reported was lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population.\nIn a bid to reassure the British public, Mr Hancock stressed that the MHRA, the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency all believed the vaccine was safe.\n\"We keep the effects of these vaccines under review all the time and we know that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is saving lives in the UK right now so if you get the call, get the jab,\" he said. \nAsked if there had been evidence of people declining the jab after the European suspensions, the health secretary said there were still \"huge numbers of people vaccinated every day\" and that \"enthusiasm for getting the vaccine is incredibly strong\".\nDowning Street has also defended the safety of the vaccine, with the PM's official spokesman insisting that Boris Johnson would be happy to take it when it came to his turn.\nMeanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall revealed on Tuesday that she had received the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab earlier this year.\nSpeaking during a visit to a pop-up vaccination centre in London with the Prince of Wales, Camilla joked that it \"didn't matter\" which jab she was given because \"I hate injections so much\".\nIt was announced in mid-February that Prince Charles, 72, and the duchess, 73, had received their first Covid jabs. Their ages meant they were included in the fourth priority group for the rollout of the vaccine.\nThe latest government figures show that 24,839,906 first doses of a Covid vaccine have now been given in the UK, with some 1,663,646 people receiving a second dose.\nCountries across Europe are seeking further clarity on the jab's safety, amid criticism of their decision to suspend its use.\nDenmark was first to pause its use of the vaccine, followed by Norway and Iceland. Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Spain, Latvia and Sweden are the latest to follow suit.\nGermany, France and Italy have said they are awaiting the outcome of the EMA investigation.\nThey said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the jab, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer it.\nDr Phil Bryan, vaccines safety lead at the MHRA, said that people \"should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so\".\n\"We are closely reviewing reports but given the large number of doses administered, and the frequency at which blood clots can occur naturally, the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause.\"\nThe WHO, which is also investigating the reports, says there is no evidence that the clots were linked to the vaccine and it has urged countries not to pause their vaccination programmes.\nProf Jeremy Brown, a member of the UK government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said concerns about blood clots were \"overblown\" as they were unlikely to be linked to the jab. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme pausing its use would cause more illness and deaths than would be prevented \"by the unlikely situation that there's an increased risk of a very rare event occurring as a consequence of the vaccine\". \nSir Kent Woods, former chief executive of the MHRA and former chair of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast there would have been a \"denting of public confidence because of the disorderly situation in Europe\" and by suspending the use of the jab countries were \"increasing the risk to the population\". \nDr Jess Harvey, a GP in Shropshire, said she had received several calls from patients concerned about the possibility of blood clots linked to the vaccine. \nShe said she had not had any appointments cancelled yet but was worried about no-shows. \nMeanwhile, Public Health England said on Tuesday that it was investigating a new coronavirus variant previously reported by the Philippines, after two cases were identified in England. \nIt said one case was linked with international travel, while the other was still under investigation.\nPHE also said that two cases of the P.1 variant of concern first found in Brazil had been identified in England - with one in the West Midlands and another in Haringey, London.\nThis variant has a mutation - known as E484 - that means it can escape some of the immune response, which may mean vaccines work less effectively against it.\nBoth cases were linked with international travel to Brazil, PHE said, and bring the total number of UK cases of the variant to 12."

      "text": "The hospitality industry is being \"scapegoated\" by the government as it moves to ease lockdown restrictions, business owners have said.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced a plan which will see hairdressers and garden centres allowed to reopen from 5 April.\nAll shops, gyms and tourist accommodation can return from 26 April.\nBut indoor hospitality including pubs, restaurants and wedding venues will still face some restrictions.\nMs Sturgeon confirmed on Tuesday that cafes and restaurants will be able to open outdoors until 22:00 from 26 April and sell alcohol.\nHowever, indoor hospitality can only open until 20:00, alcohol will not be allowed and people must meet in groups of up to four people from two households.\nAlan Henderson, of the McGinty's group which runs pubs, restaurants and a hotel in Aberdeen, accused the government of double standards.\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:  \"It is the one industry again that has been scapegoated. There are restrictions which are unnecessary.\n\"We keep getting told it's based on data rather than dates, but when they don't have the data they still pick on our industry.\n\"The hospitality industry is happy to stick to the data - but unfortunately the Scottish government is not.\"\nUp to 50 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals under the new plans.\nHowever, Duncan McConchie of the Wedding Industry Alliance said a continued ban on alcohol sales would \"turn venue owners into police\".\nHe said: \"People will drink, but they will go to their cars and drink. They will go to the toilets and drink.\n\"Whereas, if we are allowed to sell alcohol, we are then in charge of the alcohol that those guests consume.\"\nMr McConchie said the industry was \"broadly accepting and happy\" with Tuesday's announcements, \"but the devil is in the detail that comes back to bite us\".\nJulia Eeeles, who owns The One Lounge hairdressing and beauty salon in Glasgow, said partial reopening without allowing for beauty treatments would leave her worse off.\n\"The problem for me - and I think there will be a lot of beauty salons like this - is that I've got two hairdressers but 10 other members of staff.\n\"So I am actually under financial strain having to open up just for two people.\n\"It means I have to run the salon, run reception and use all my gas and electricity. It doesn't help me as a business owner.\"\nMs Sturgeon also announced that the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted from 5 April.\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date.\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\"."

      "tags": "Schools,Holyhead,Wales education",
      "text": "A town's schools could be closed in a bid to curb \"extremely concerning\" Covid-19 infection rates.\nIn Holyhead, on Anglesey, there have been 43 positive tests in the past seven days. The town had an average case rate of 401.2 per 100,000 over that period.\nOver the past seven days, the rate for Wales was 42.5.\nAnglesey council leader Llinos Medi Huws said \"all options\" were being considered in discussions with schools. \nShe told Dros Frecwast, on Radio Cymru, that as well as the idea of closing schools discussions included whether there was a need for a local lockdown around Holyhead.\n\"We're looking at all options but we need to look at how realistic it is to enforce them because we're dependent on the local people complying with the new restrictions,\" she said.\nSpeaking to Newyddion S4C on Wednesday evening, Ms Huws said the council had decided to widen testing to include people with a wider range of symptoms.\nThe authority would also extend the opening hours of the testing centre in Holyhead and allow people to turn up without an appointment, she said.\nSo far this month, 54% of the 174 positive coronavirus cases on Anglesey - identified through the Test, Trace and Protect team - have been in and around Holyhead.\nStaff at Ysbyty Gwynedd, in Bangor, were caring for 32 patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday morning - 15 of whom had become infected in hospital, according to Alyson Constantine, acute care director at the hospital.\nShe added there were also 31 recovering patients who had had Covid.\nThe council said although some cases had links to the recent outbreak at Ysbyty Gwynedd, household, cross-household and workplace transmission in the Holyhead area were \"also increasing and a significant cause for concern\".\nPrevention and Surveillance Group chairman and deputy council chief executive Dylan Williams said: \"The situation in Holyhead and recent increase in cases is extremely concerning.\n\"We must all play our part now by following the all-important guidance - sticking to social distancing, wearing a mask when we need to and not mixing with family and friends. \n\"We understand that these measures are tough on everyone it is the only way we can return to some sort of normality.\"\nSpeaking at Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh government was \"concerned\" about growing rates of the virus in Merthyr Tydfil, Conwy and Anglesey.\nHe said in the case of Anglesey in particular, it was important to gain an understanding of why case numbers were rising.\n\"We are concerned about those three authorities in particular, because we're aware they have the most visible rise in case rates\", he said.\n\"If they'd followed the national trend overall then we would have seen a further reduction, so they do make a difference to the overall figure.\n\"In the one sense, it makes it much more visible, because the rest of Wales has been able to behave collectively together in such a way where we've been able to keep coronavirus rates low.\"\nDr Frank Atherton, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, said: \"Where you have small populations like Anglesey, like Merthyr for example, any movement in the numbers because of clusters of cases, due to household mixing or whatever, small changes in the numbers can lead to big changes in the rates because the population is quite small. So we're seeing a bit of that in Anglesey, I think.\"\nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: \"Although the rates have been falling, and falling very well, they do seem to be bottoming out - the message still has to be, whilst we get the vaccine rolled out we have to be cautious as a nation, particularly avoid mixing with households.\" \nWhen asked if we would see more local lockdowns, he said: \"The experience last year with local lockdowns wasn't very encouraging, we found that a once-for-Wales approach is more effective in bringing rates down.\n\"Local outbreaks can be managed locally - if we see spikes or occurrences in a local authority area or based on an employer then that will be managed locally. If the rates overall across Wales start to go up, then who knows - we can't rule out the fact we might have to reverse that.\"\nWhen asked about the flare-up on Anglesey, Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Janet Finch-Saunders said: \"I do not agree with local lockdowns.\"\nThe Aberconwy MS added: \"I think it's about finding out exactly how this happened, but it is fair to say that people are becoming very tired now of restricted movement.\"\nThe Welsh government said it was \"closely monitoring the situation\" and would \"consider whether further measures are needed\".

      "text": "St Patrick's Day \"must be different\" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues, First Minister Arlene Foster has warned.\nShe made the plea as she announced the first key changes to the restrictions.\nAll primary school pupils will return next Monday with all post-primary students set to return on 12 April.\nThere will also be changes to meeting up and some sports will be allowed to resume from 1 April.\nMrs Foster said decision-making capital was limited and needed to be \"spent wisely\".\n\"If we spend the capital on one easement of restrictions, it can't be spent on other things at the same time,\" she told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday.\nThe executive has regular review points every four weeks, with the next scheduled for 15 April.\nOutlining details of the executive's decisions, Mrs Foster said it was important restrictions were worked through in a \"careful and managed way\" at each review point.\n\"St Patrick's Day would normally be enjoyed by many. We need this to be different tomorrow,\" she said.\n\"Please continue to stay home. Do not socialise outside your family or your bubble, and we particularly want to say to young people that you need to follow the rules and the advice.\"\nShe said the decision to prioritise education was important for children to \"build and grow their friendship networks, to be able to socialise and grow their own interests and future potential\".\n\"The weather is improving and we have been in this current lockdown for around 80 days,\" added the first minister.\n\"That is a long time and a big ask, and we have been so grateful to everyone who has made a personal contribution to the improvement in the Covid situation.   \nMrs Foster acknowledged some people would be disappointed their sectors had not yet been given dates to reopen.\n\"We have focused on outdoor settings where the risk is relatively lower than indoor settings,\" she added.\nThe Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey also appealed for a quiet day. \nOn Tuesday she met representatives of Belfast City Council, local elected representatives, the PSNI, and Ulster and Queen's Universities, to discuss plans in place to prevent large gatherings in the Holylands area of Belfast.\n\"This year it is more important than ever that those who live in the Holylands and surrounding areas adhere to public health guidelines.  \n\"Breaches of those guidelines are completely unacceptable,\" she said.\nThe executive has also agreed to increase the provision for elite sports from March 25 March to allow a number of new competitions to begin.\nMrs Foster said the \"minor adjustment\" to the restrictions would allow two World Cup qualification matches scheduled for 25 and 31 March to take place as well as a friendly match between NI and the USA on 28 March. \nNo spectators will be permitted at any sporting event. \nStormont's health minister said it was vitally important that a \"free-for-all\" situation was avoided as restrictions eased.\nIn a paper for the Stormont Executive, Robin Swann said he continued to recommend a gradual approach.\nThere pandemic had resulted in \"increased harmful alcohol consumption, more snacking and increased sedentary behaviour\", he added.\nCommenting on the reopening of schools Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Children and Young People said she was \"pleased with a tinge of frustration\" about the move.\nKoulla Yiasouma told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that many primary school staff had been preparing for further remote learning, in the absence of clarity from the executive.\nDr Tom Black, chair of BMA Northern Ireland Council, said it was \"extremely important\" for children to return to school for their educational and social development as well as their mental health.\nHe said it was also very important that any easing of restrictions was done in a safe way.\nSport NI welcomed what it called \"the first cautious steps towards a return to outdoor sport\".\nUlster GAA said the organisation's Covid advisory group will issue updated guidance following news that groups of up to 15 people will be able to train together from 12 April.\nIt said clubs in Northern Ireland must stress to players and management teams that \"12 April is the earliest date that they may be permitted to resume activity\".\nReacting to the news about click and collect services Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was a \"much-needed lifeline to those struggling independent retailers\".\nThe chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, also called for indicative dates and clarity. \n\"At the very least, the data behind reopening decisions should be published,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, one death was reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 2,100.\nA further 164 cases of the virus were also confirmed.\nThere are 176 inpatients currently being treated for coronavirus in Northern Ireland, with 18 in intensive care.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Department of Health has reported 18 further Covid-related deaths and 349 new cases. Seventeen deaths occurred in March and one in February.\nIt brings the total number of deaths in the Republic of Ireland to 4,552 and the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases stands at 227,663.\nIn Northern Ireland, tough coronavirus restrictions were initially imposed on 26 December, in a bid to curb a rise in cases of Covid-19.\nThere have been some adjustments to the rules but households are generally still not allowed to mix indoors, pubs, cafes and restaurants remain closed except for takeaway, and most shops are shut.\nIn Northern Ireland, P1 to P3 pupils returned to the classroom last Monday, as did nursery and pre-school children.\nLast week, the executive ditched a previous plan for those pupils to go back to remote learning on 22 March when some secondary schoolchildren, year groups 12 to 14, are due to return to school.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir had been pushing for all remaining pupils to return as soon as possible and two weeks notice would have been preferable.\n\"My preference would have been that earlier decisions were taken,\" he said.\n\"That has to be weighed up against the wider public health situation and also a desire from the executive as a whole to try to take this in the context of a strategic decision in relation to that.\"\nMr Weir said it was important to get children back to school as soon as possible.\nVulnerable children and children of key workers have had access to schools for supervised learning since January, and special schools remained open as usual.\nSchools in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have all reopened on a wider basis."

      "text": "Thousands of London taxi drivers plan to sue Uber for damages alleging the ride-hailing firm operated unlawfully.\nThe planned group legal action could, if successful, hit Uber with a bill for millions of pounds.\nThe action, part of a planned anti-Uber campaign by black-cab drivers this year, claims it didn't follow private hire rules between 2012 and 2018.\nUber said it \"operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded\".\nThe group action, which will be launched by law firm Mishcon de Reya, will allege that for six years Uber operated unlawfully in London.\nTaxi rules in London mean that people have to contact a centralised office for minicabs, whereas they can hail a black cab on the street.\nThe lawsuit will claim that between 2012 and 2018, Uber let people hail its drivers directly, contravening those rules.\nLitigation specialist RGL Management, which is also working with the cabbies to bring the case, said more than 4,000 had signed up so far.\nThere are about 5,200 further registrations being processed, with hundreds of enquiries per day, it said. The firm is funding a marketing campaign, and is looking to sign up as many as 30,000 eligible drivers.\nA full-time driver over those six years could claim about \u00a325,000 in lost earnings, it added. The group action is aiming to bring a case to the High Court no later than the first quarter of 2022.\nThis is not the first time that London's black cabs have done battle with Uber, but today's announcement shows neither side have conceded defeat. \nThe proposed claim itself is huge - loss of earnings for up to 30,000 drivers for nearly 6 years -  and comes at a time when London black cabs and private hire vehicle drivers are struggling for work after nearly a year of lockdowns and restrictions.\nUber might now have its licence back, but the black cabs aren't willing to give them an easy ride.\nAn Uber spokeswoman said: \"Uber operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded.\n\"We are proud to serve this great global city and the 45,000 drivers in London who rely on the app for earnings opportunities, and are committed to helping people move safely.\"\nUber has had a torrid history in the UK capital including previous lawsuits.\nIn February 2019 cab drivers lost a legal challenge which argued that Uber's London operating licence was granted by a biased judge.\nUber then went on to lose its licence to operate in London in November 2019 after safety concerns.\nBut in September last year it was spared a London ban after a judge upheld an appeal against Transport for London's decision over safety."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "Countries around the world are celebrating St Patrick's Day on Wednesday, with online events replacing traditional parades.\nLandmarks across the globe turned green for the day in honour of Ireland's patron saint.\nLarge gatherings were ruled out in many parts of the world due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin were cancelled for the second year in a row.\nHowever events marking the day took place across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which are being streamed online.\nThey included an online disco and live music events in Belfast, while more than 100 online events were held in the Republic of Ireland and broadcast around the world.\nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition continued this year, albeit virtually. \nThe bowl was placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders discussed, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.\nThey might not have been in the same room but President Biden and the taoiseach were still able to virtually wish each other a Happy Saint Patrick's Day.\nIt was a day of a firsts - a first for Joe Biden as president who pledged his support for the Good Friday Agreement.\nReferring to the Good Friday Agreement he said: \"We strongly support y and think it is critically important that we maintain it. The political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples.\"\nAnd it was also Mr Martin's first St Patrick's Day as taoiseach.\nHe said he wanted to move forward with a \"positive relationship with the UK.\"\n\"That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. \n\"That in turn then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island - goals I know you support,\" he added.\nNorthern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers also held a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. \nA range of issues were covered during the meeting including progress on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery, as well as highlighting regional strengths and priorities.\nMichelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster Ministers also expressed hope that President Biden and Vice President Harris would visit Northern Ireland at some point in the future.\nHundreds of extra police officers were on duty in Northern Ireland for a \"robust\" response to St Patrick's Day rule breakers.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster had warned that St Patrick's Day \"must be different\" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Garda\u00ed (police) had a significant operation in place to deal with planned protests in Dublin city centre. \nSixteen people were arrested in the city for failing to comply with directions from garda to abide by Covid-19 regulations.\nThe Queen extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as 10 years ago.\"\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, with a record number of places taking part.\nSome 690 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nAlongside more famous landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Leaning Tower of Pisa were more quirky ones such as an abandoned sauna tilted on its side beside a lake in Finland, and a solar power-generated giraffe in Mozambique.\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River but the city's mayor decided to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nSt Patrick lived in the 5th Century and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nSt Patrick's Day started as a religious feast to celebrate his work, but it has grown to be an international festival of all things Irish."

The Britannia will cruise from Southampton along the south coast of England for three or four days, and the Iona will travel up to Scotland from Southampton for seven-day trips.\nCarnival said that passengers wishing to board would have to have had both vaccination jabs at least a week before departure.\nGuests will also have to have travel insurance that \"must include medical and repatriation cover\" and medical expenses related to Covid-19.\nGuests and crew will be expected to respect social distancing rules and wear masks when appropriate.\nAnd should anyone test positive on board, they will be isolated and quarantined.\nPaul Ludlow, the president of P&O Cruises, said Carnival expected a government-approved way to prove people had been vaccinated by the summer.\n\"This is moving at pace,\" he said. \"We anticipate by the 27 June, which is our first sailing, there will be a government-accredited scheme to prove your vaccination, but at the very least, then of course, a letter from your GP would suffice.\"\nHe said that P&O Cruises was \"in close conversation with government every day\" about travellers being able to prove their vaccination status.\n\"At the moment we're stipulating that all guests of all ages must be vaccinated to come on board with us,\" Mr Ludlow added.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Transport said it was leading efforts \"to develop a framework that can safely facilitate international travel when the time is right, while still managing the risk from imported cases and variants\".\nCarnival follows Saga cruises, which said in January that all customers had to be vaccinated. British Airways also plans to let people register when they have had two vaccinations on a smartphone app. \nCarnival has not run cruises for a year due to the coronavirus crisis.\nThe cruise industry was brought to its knees after regulators around the world stopped ships from sailing to try to limit outbreaks.\nThere were a number of deaths from Covid-19 after people were infected on board Carnival ships early last year. The first UK citizen to die of coronavirus was infected on the Carnival-run Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.\nAt the time, the outbreak on the ship was the largest outside mainland China, with more than 600 people infected.\nSimon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, said \"a lot is unusual\" about the \"staycation\" cruises P&O is planning.\n\"Because the voyages are 'cruises to nowhere', the captains will look at the weather forecast and aim to sail where it is warm and sunny,\" he said.\nHe added the P&O concept is \"you can look but you can't touch\".\n\"On a voyage around the Scottish islands, for example, Iona will anchor off Iona, the magical island after which she was named, but you can't step ashore,\" he said.\nDoing this circumvents all kinds of problems, he said.\n\"There are concerns about shore excursions. Some ports of call may not welcome hundreds of people from a wide range of locations wandering around, and conversely some cruise lines do not want their passengers to mingle with locals - MSC Cruises has made it a condition of travel,\" he said.\nCarnival has been burning through cash and last quarter said it had made a net loss of $2.2bn.\nAirport operators have also been on the ropes due to the coronavirus crisis. They said on Wednesday that passenger numbers travelling through UK airports last summer plunged to their lowest level since 1975.\nAirport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee called for tailored government support.\n\"Despite dealing with the biggest crisis in their history, most airports remain operational to support vital public services, such as Royal Mail, air ambulances, Coastguard and the National Police Air Service, as well as other critical services such as freight, including PPE and vaccines,\" she said.\nThe Unite union also called for tailored support, saying that more than 5,100 UK aviation and related jobs have been lost every month since February 2020.\nUnite assistant general secretary for transport Diana Holland said: \"It has been heart-breaking to see so many UK jobs go in aviation when we know that demand will come back. \n\"A staggering number of workers in the sector are now unemployed but when we look across the Channel, we see that a different approach from governments actually saves these jobs.\"\nThe government has previously said that it has provided unprecedented support to businesses across sectors of the economy including aviation.\nA spokesperson told the BBC the government was committed to restarting cruise travel when it is safe to do so, and is working closely with the sector to prepare for a safe and successful restart.\n\"We have put in place an unprecedented package of business support and recently extended government-backed loans and furlough payments to businesses, including in the travel industry.   \n\"Around \u00a37bn has been pledged to the aviation sector since the start of the pandemic, and through the Global Travel Taskforce we are working hard to restart international travel when it is safe to do so,\" the spokesperson said."

      "text": "A bonus payment will be paid to all NHS and social care workers in Wales.\nThe Welsh government said it would pay nearly 222,000 people the equivalent of \u00a3735 each, with an element to cover tax and National Insurance deductions.\nIt means most would get \u00a3500, Health Minster Vaughan Gething said, adding it \"expresses our gratitude\" to those working in those jobs.\nBut the Royal College of Nursing warned \"a one-off Covid-19 bonus is not a significant and substantive pay rise\".\nIt is the second bonus for social care staff, and the first for NHS workers.\n\"Nurses have gone above and beyond in the past 12 months,\" said Helen Whyley, director of RCN Wales.\nShe called for fair pay that encouraged nurses to stay in the profession and attract more staff.\nHowever, the announcement was welcomed by the trade union Unison Cymru Wales, which said it was \"in contrast to the insulting approach of the Conservative UK government\".\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has recommended a 1% pay rise to an independent panel examining salaries of NHS staff in England.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said it was as much as ministers could give. The \u00a3735 payment is separate to NHS pay.\nThe Welsh Tories' Janet Finch-Saunders called for \"longer-term pay recognition\" for staff, while Plaid Cymru said the difference in health care and social care pay needed to be addressed.\nBoth parties backed a minimum wage for social care workers of \u00a310 an hour in the Senedd on Wednesday evening.\nThe bonus award, the Welsh government said, will benefit an estimated 221,945 people.\nThey include 103,600 social care staff, 90,000 NHS Wales staff, 2,345 deployed students and 26,000 primary care staff, including pharmacy, GP, dental and optometry workers.\nLast year a \u00a3500 payment was made to social care staff, but it did not cover any element of tax that would need to be paid on it.\nWelsh ministers argued the Treasury should cover it. Plaid had called the handling of the matter \"baffling\".\nThe Welsh government said it was working with councils - which fund social care - and trade unions to finalise how the new payments would work.\nAt a Covid briefing on Wednesday Mr Gething said the Welsh government would not set an \"arbitrary cap\" on a pay rise for NHS staff.\nThe issue of NHS pay rises is considered by independent pay review bodies who recommend how much staff should earn. \n\"For NHS staff it really does feel like a kick in the teeth for the UK government to say there would only be a 1% pay raise and that's what they want the pay review bodies to agree to,\" said Mr Gething.\n\"That isn't what we've done here in Wales, I've released the evidence and the letters that I have sent to those pay review bodies, we are not setting an arbitrary cap.\"\nThe announcement came ahead of a Senedd debate, where Plaid Cymru said it would call for social workers to receive \u00a310 an hour.\nDelyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru Senedd member, said: \"This is a one-off recognition, it's a bonus because of the sacrifices that everyone in these sectors have had to make this past year\n\"The wider conversation we should be having is about the fact that there is this huge disparity between what health workers, and what care workers receive.\"\nJanet Finch-Saunders, for the Welsh Conservatives, told BBC Wales she wanted to see \"longer-term pay recognition\" for staff, but said the payment was \"welcome news\".\nAsked what she would want to see in terms of a pay rise, she said: \"I don't think you can quantify or put in an actual percentage figure, but I just hope that here in Wales with the money that they now have that they actually do reward our health and social care workers.\""

      "tags": "Spain,France,Greece,Travel,Ursula von der Leyen,Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A digital certificate to kick-start foreign travel should be given to citizens across the EU \"without discrimination\", officials say.\nThe aim is to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU.\nThe 27 member states will decide how to use the new digital certificate.\nVaccine passports have faced opposition from some EU member states over concerns they might be discriminatory.\nSome argue that they would enable a minority to enjoy foreign travel without restrictions while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face measures such as quarantine. European Commission officials have made clear they want to avoid discrimination.\nAnother issue raised has been that data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete.\nAhead of the EU's announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was working to \"create an international trusted framework\" for safe travel, but that vaccinations should not be a condition. \nSeparately, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has threatened to withhold exporting vaccines to the UK and any other countries outside the EU that do not supply doses in a reciprocal way. \n\"We're still waiting for doses to come from the UK,\" she said. \"So, this is an invitation to show us that there are also doses from the UK coming to the European Union.\" \nSpeaking in Brussels on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed digital green certificate would be \"for all EU citizens, their families when they're leaving the EU or living abroad\". \n\"It'll also be for the European Economic Area (EEA), because we want to work with Norway and Iceland,\" he said, adding that Switzerland would also be involved. \nMr Reynders said there was still a lot to do to put the digital certificate in place, but the aim was to get it up and running before the summer tourist season. \nThe European Commission proposal sets out that any EU member state permitting vaccinated travellers to bypass restrictions such as quarantine must accept certificates from other states within the bloc under the same conditions. \nThe vaccines should be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These currently include drugs developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, but not Russia's Sputnik V or China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. \nHowever, the proposal adds that the guidelines \"should not prevent member states from deciding to accept vaccination certificates issued for other Covid-19 vaccines\".\nMeanwhile, in the UK, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was looking at the idea of vaccine passports and had been \"discussing what the best way to proceed is\".\n\"We are having debates, discussions about travel... but I think what we also have to do is be driven by the data, we've got to see how coronavirus develops,\" he told the BBC.\nMore than a third of the UK population - nearly 25 million people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine in the UK, which is no longer a member of the European Union.\nThe rollout across the EU has been slower, and has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the current suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over fears of possible side effects. \nThe economies of countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy are unlikely to recover until the tourist industry is reopened, and they have been looking at ways to save the summer season while providing a safe environment for both travellers and local residents. \nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Wednesday welcomed the planned certificate, which he said would \"significantly facilitate the movement of citizens and will help boost tourism and the economies that rely heavily on it\".\nLast month, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos said that a common digital certificate was \"not discriminatory\", and that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer - but the procedure for them would be slower as they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival.\nA hotel manager in the Spanish resort of Benidorm, Ricardo S\u00e1nchez, told the BBC that the UK was its most important market, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, and people arriving from Eastern Europe. \n\"So many months working with so many restrictions and the restrictions are changing every 15 days,\" he said, adding that would-be tourists were unsure what to do and were waiting for \"good news\" before booking reservations. \nIceland has said it is opening its borders to visitors who have received the vaccine without the need for testing or quarantine later this week.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS has warned of a \"significant reduction in the weekly supply\" of Covid vaccines in England next month in a letter to local health organisations.\nThe letter says there has been a \"reduction in national inbound vaccines supply\" and asks organisations to \"ensure no further appointments are uploaded\" to booking systems in April.\nThe health secretary said it was a \"standard\" letter.\nThe BBC understands no-one who has booked a vaccine should lose a slot. \nAsked about it during a Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said the NHS regularly sent out \"technical letters\" that explained the \"ups and downs\" of supply.\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there would be fewer AstraZeneca vaccines than expected because of issues with the company's international supply. \nBBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood that the vaccine supply issue related to a consignment from a manufacturer in India, with half of the order delayed by four weeks.\nA spokesperson for the AstraZeneca said: \"Our UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule.\" \nWe were always warned supply was fragile - and these developments are a reminder of that.\nThe UK has its own plants that are supplying one to two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine each week. \nThere are also stocks coming from Pfizer's Belgium plant - these would be the ones that would be susceptible to any restrictions on exports the EU is threatening.\nThe Indian supplies were supposed to give the UK the \"bumper\" end to March, allowing the government to push ahead with vaccination of the under-50s within weeks.\nThis has now been put on hold, given significant numbers will need their second doses from the start of next month.\nThe government is still on track to hit its target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July. \nBy late Spring the first doses of Moderna - the third vaccine to have been approved in the UK - should start arriving.\nBut the delay to the second shipment from India means rollout is going to take a little longer than hoped at the start of this week.\nThe letter from the NHS in England says that \"over this next period it is vital\" that health organisations focus on vaccinating those in the priority groups one to nine, who are most vulnerable to coronavirus. \nIt advises vaccination services to work with local authorities, voluntary community and faith organisations \"to put in place reserve lists\" of people eligible for the vaccine - as well as targeting areas of lower uptake. \nThe NHS says vaccination centres and community pharmacy-led services should close unfilled bookings from the week commencing 29 March.\nEarlier, it was announced that almost half of British adults have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - more than 25 million people.\nAround 1.7 million people have also had a second dose.\nDuring Wednesday's briefing, Mr Hancock said the UK was \"ahead of schedule\" to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April.\nHe also reiterated a commitment to ensuring that all adults in the UK are offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\nSpeaking alongside the health secretary, Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said \"every day we vaccinate more people we are preventing more deaths\".\nAnd England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was \"no evidence\" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine causes an \"increased risk\" of blood clots.\nThe EU's medicines regulator has said it remains \"firmly convinced\" that the benefits of the  jab outweigh the risks, after several leading EU states paused their rollouts.\nProf Van-Tam added that all medicines have both side effects and benefits, and listed some of the rare side effects of paracetamol as examples, pointing out that most people had no issue with taking it.\nBBC politics correspondent Jonathan Blake said the hold-up would have an impact on the momentum of the vaccine rollout and possibly the government's targets.\nLabour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that people \"across the country\" would be \"anxious and worried\" about the news of delays.\n\"Matt Hancock must explain what the issue is with supply and what efforts are being made to resolve them,\" he added.\nOn Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that if Covid vaccine supplies in Europe do not improve, the EU \"will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate\".\nThe EU and the UK have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the export of the vaccines, exacerbated by post-Brexit disagreements.\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Hancock confirmed that shielding guidance in England would end on 31 March - meaning that more than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard. A further 5,758 people have tested positive."

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "text": "Conservative MP David Davis has used parliamentary privilege to criticise the Scottish government's handling of allegations against Alex Salmond. \nThe former minister told MPs during a Commons debate that there had been a \"concerted effort\" by SNP officials to encourage complainers to come forward.\nMr Davis also suggested Scottish government officials knew earlier than previously acknowledged of the claims. \nA spokesman for Nicola Sturgeon has dismissed the allegations.  \nMr Davis accused the Scottish government of ignoring its own procedures and \"actively withholding information\" from the Holyrood inquiry which has been tasked with looking at the issue. \nDuring the debate he also said: \"I have it on good authority that there exists from 6th Feb 2018 an exchange of messages between civil servants suggesting that the first minister's chief of staff is interfering in the complaints process against Alex Salmond.\n\"If true this suggests the chief of staff had knowledge of the case in February, not April as she has claimed.\"\nMr Davis said he had been passed messages from the telephone of a senior SNP official by a whistleblower.\nHe read some of the messages out in the Commons and said they \"show that there is a concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" after the criminal investigation into Mr Salmond had started. \nThe intervention from Mr Davis came on the day a leading QC asked to examine the government's procedures  - after it conceded its handling of complaints against Alex Salmond was \"unlawful\" - published her findings.\nLaura Dunlop made a range of recommendations about how complaints against serving ministers could be investigated but said probes concerning former ministers should be independent.\nMs Dunlop's report came ahead of two other keenly anticipated reports relating to the bungled civil action against Mr Salmond. \nA Holyrood inquiry into what went wrong and an independent investigation of whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code in her contact with her predecessor are both due to report back in the coming weeks. \nA spokesman for First Minister Ms Sturgeon said: \"As with Mr Salmond's previous claims and cherry picking of messages, the reality is very different to the picture being presented.\n\"Every message involving SNP staff has been seen by the committee previously. Their views have been widely reported as dismissive of them.\"\nOn Wednesday, the Holyrood inquiry committee published a further submission from a former government staffer, Lorraine Kay, supporting Mr Salmond's claims.\nThe former first minister has said he was passed the name of one of the complainers during the investigation, while meetings between himself and Ms Sturgeon were being arranged.\nMs Sturgeon has said she does not accept that this happened, but Ms Kay told MSPs that she was also told the name by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein.\nTwo other allies of the former first minster - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have also backed this account, which opposition MSPs say would be an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\".\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she believed Mr Salmond was already aware of who the complainers were, and that what was said to Mr Aberdein was \"a matter of contention\"."

      "title": "The man who taught Uber how to say sorry",
      "tags": "Companies,Lyft,Uber,Long Reads,Customer service",
      "text": "When the Uber he'd hired went to the wrong destination, one professor took his complaint to the very top - and then learned something valuable about the science of apologising.\nIn January 2017, John List was due to give a keynote speech at a prestigious gathering of economists. He picked up his phone and, using the Uber app, booked a cab to take him the 30-minute journey from his home. He looked up briefly, as the car sped along Lake Shore Drive, on the banks of Lake Michigan, and took in the view of the approaching city, with its fabulous skyline of skyscrapers. Then he settled back down to work on his talk.\nAbout 20 minutes later he looked up again. Surely he must be nearly there now? \"Oh no!!\" he screamed. He was back where he'd begun. Something had gone wrong with the Uber app, which had instructed the driver to return to the professor's home. She had not wanted to disturb him, as he was so engrossed in his work.\nList was understandably furious. But what made him more so, was that Uber never sent him an apology.  \nNot everyone who has a complaint to make with Uber has access to its chief executive, but John List did, and so he rang Travis Kalanick that evening. (This was not long before Kalanick was forced to step down as a result of shareholder pressure, following a series of controversies over company practices including its handling of sexual harassment allegations.)\nAfter List had related the tale, and let off a bit of steam, Kalanick spoke. \"What I want to know,\" he said, \"is how Uber should apologise when this sort of cock-up occurs.  What's the best way to keep Uber customers loyal, even when they've had a miserable experience?\"\nHow to apologise is a question which every company is interested to know the answer. And John List was in a unique position to find out.\nNot many people with John List's background become leading academics. He grew up in a working class family in Sun Prairie, north-east of the Wisconsin capital Madison. His Dad was a lorry driver and expected his son to enter the family business. John had other ideas. His dream was to become a professional golfer and he won a golf scholarship to college. There he discovered two things: first, he wasn't as good at golf as he had once thought, and second, he was fascinated by economics.\nHe's now on the economics faculty at one of America's top universities, the University of Chicago. But for a few years he's also been moonlighting, because Uber approached him to be their chief economist, and after he moved on from Uber, he joined another car-riding app, Lyft, where he holds the same position.\nNo doubt the job is generously remunerated, but for John List it has another appeal; for data geeks, car apps are like gold mines - in the US alone, before the pandemic, there were two million Uber drivers, making tens of millions of trips each week. John List has spent his career studying economic behaviour in the real world, so working with Uber \"was a dream come true\". With this cornucopia of information, he could analyse all sorts of consumer preferences: what kinds of cars people like, how far they typically travelled, and at what times, how they responded to a change in the price of fares. He could also learn the best way to apologise.\nHis first step was to look at what happened to Uber users after they had had a bad ride - one that had taken much longer than the app had initially predicted. The app might predict, for example, that a journey would take nine minutes, and it would end up taking 23 minutes. By crunching the numbers, he and his collaborators discovered that riders who'd experienced such a bad ride would spend up to 10% less on Uber in the future. That represented a significant loss of earnings for the car app.\nThe next move was to come up with a variety of apologies, and to randomly try them out on those who'd experienced a bad trip.\nIt turns out there's a sort of science of sorry. Social scientists - and psychologists in particular - have studied what kinds of apologies work. But John List had a big advantage; he could actually measure the impact.\nHe calls one type of sorry, the \"basic apology\" - \"We note that your trip took longer than we predicted and we sincerely apologise.\" A more sophisticated apology involves an admission that the company messed up. Another type of apology involves a commitment - \"We will try to ensure that this will not happen again.\"  \nOn Uber's behalf, John List tried them all. What's more, with some of these apologies Uber offered a $5 discount off the next trip. In the experiment there was also a group of Uber customers who received no apology at all.\nThe result was surprising. On their own, apologies in whatever form proved ineffective. But an apology coupled with the $5 coupon kept many people loyal. \"So, we end up bringing back millions of dollars by assuaging consumers with an apology and a coupon.\"\nWhat consumers want, it turns out, is for a company to demonstrate its remorse by taking a material financial hit. But looking deeper into the stats, List realised that even this device ceased to work if there was a second or third bad trip. Indeed, a second or third apology only seemed to alienate customers further.\nThese are invaluable insights for Uber, and for other businesses too.\nMany economists sit at their desks and make predictions about economic activity based on their models. What makes John List a little unusual for an economist is that he likes to test theories out in the real world. He's conducted experiments from Tanzania, to New Zealand, China to Bangladesh.  \nThe vast digital data sets held by Uber and other car apps have enabled him to identify certain quirks in human behaviour that armchair economists might not have uncovered. For example, when you book an Uber you never know whether you'll get a male or female driver, so you might expect male and female drivers to earn the same. But in fact, male drivers earn about 7% more per hour than their female counterparts. Shocked by this disparity, List set about trying to find out the reason for it.  \nHe uncovered several explanations. One is that women tend to have more childcare responsibilities, so there are fewer female drivers available at lucrative times, such as morning and afternoon rush hour. But by far the most important factor turns out to be speed: Uber-driving men drive on average about 2.5% faster than Uber-driving women, so they give more rides per hour. \nThat's not the only gender gap. Because he thought it would make Uber drivers happier, List persuaded the Uber board to add a tipping function - bringing Uber in line with other car apps. He then studied tipping behaviour. For every $4 women give as a tip, it transpired, men give around $5. What's more, women drivers receive more tips than male drivers - except when those women drivers are 65 years old or older. I think we can take this as further evidence of male shallowness.\nThe study of economic behaviour through car app data has been called Ubernomics - though John List's box of data toys is now delivered to him by Lyft, not Uber - and he continues to produce a stream of fascinating results. Analysing the behaviour of Lyft users, he's recently computed the power of what he calls \"left-digit bias\". Cutting the price of a journey from $15 to $14.99 has roughly the same impact on consumer demand as reducing it from $15.99 to $15. \nSome of the discoveries in Ubernomics are unsurprising. Consumers care about price: the lower the cost, the more likely we are to book a cab. But the analysis of how we use car apps is also revealing some of the biases and idiosyncrasies of human economic behaviour.\nBy the way, if you ever decide to become an Uber driver, and think that being nice to the customer will have a significant impact on your income, there is some bad news. I'm afraid it won't. Even when customers rate one driver 10% higher than another for niceness, John List says, they both receive the same tip.\nWe are not used to the idea of machines making ethical decisions, but the day when they will routinely do this - by themselves - is fast approaching. So how, asks the BBC's David Edmonds, will we teach them to do the right thing?\nCan we teach robots ethics?"

      "tags": "Companies,Gig economy,UK Supreme Court,Employment,Pay,Uber,Self-employment",
      "text": "Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled.\nThe decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay.\nThe ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. \nUber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. \nIn a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds.\nUber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model.\nIt is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. \nFormer Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. \nThe two, who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016, told the BBC they were \"thrilled and relieved\" by the ruling.\n\"I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,\" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU).\n\"We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground.\"\nUber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. \nThe company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018.\nThe ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. \nDelivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app.\nThe court considered several elements in its judgement:\nLooking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours.\nJamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: \"We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. \n\"Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury.  \n\"We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.\"\nUber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport.\nBy not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers \"workers\" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off.\nThis is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app.\nPreviously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car.\n\"This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,\" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary.\n\"The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion.\"\nMr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long.\n\"It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,\" he said.\nMr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic, many drivers have been struggling financially and feel trapped in Uber's system.\n\"We're seeing many of our members earning \u00a330 gross a day right now,\" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs.\n\"If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on.\"\nThat remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen.\nWhen Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business.\nThe company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would \"incur significant additional expenses\" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime.\n\"Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,\" it added.\nUber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares.\nThis relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. \nMr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. \n\"I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,\" he told the BBC.\n\"The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,\" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. \n\"It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than \u00a31bn in VAT and interest.\"\nHMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability.\nTom Vickers is a senior lecturer in sociology at Nottingham Trent University and head of the Work Futures Research Group, which studies the jobs that people do and how they change over time.\nHe thinks the Supreme Court's ruling has wider implications for a lot of other gig economy workers like other private hire drivers, couriers and delivery drivers.\n\"The central point for me is that the ruling focuses on the control that companies exercise over people's labour - this control also carries with it responsibilities for their conditions and wellbeing.\n\"This is even more important in the context of the pandemic.\"\nAs for Uber, Rachel Mathieson, senior associate at Bates Wells, which represented Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, said her firm's position was that the ruling applies to all 90,000 drivers who have been active with Uber since and including 2016.\n\"Our position is that the ruling applies to all of their drivers at large,\" she said.\nDr Alex Wood, an Internet Institute research associate on gig economy at Oxford University, disagrees.\nHe told the BBC that because the UK doesn't have a labour inspectorate, these \"rules aren't enforced and it falls to workers to bring subsequent tribunals\". \nThis means that \"in reality, it's very easy for Uber to just ignore this until more tribunals come for the remaining 40,000 [drivers]\".

      "tags": "Companies,Gig economy,Employment,Pay,Uber,Self-employment",
      "text": "Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions.\nThe ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or \u00a38.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. \nIt comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. \nUber said it was \"turning the page\" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough.\nAnalysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK.\nWriting in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: \"This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. \n\"They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change.\"\nUnion leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it \"a very significant milestone\".  \nHowever, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. \nThe changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed.\nIn February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. \nIt argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. \nBut the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. \nUber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. \nThe company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. \nUber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling.\nThe company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. \nUber says:\nJamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: \"Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives.\n\"Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,\" he said.\nUber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension.\nThe company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly.\nBoss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was \"really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law\".\nBut she suggested Uber was trying to \"cherry pick\" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off.\nInstead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off.\nJames Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still \"short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%\". \n\"Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,\" they said.\nOthers pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. \nDespite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy.\nNigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: \"We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. \n\"And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'\"\nUber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they \"already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower\". \nHowever, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure \"any changes we make directly benefit them\".\nMary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean \"some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading\". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added.\nUnion leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. \"This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,\" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts.\n\"It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,\" Mr Rix said. \nUnion reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. \nAfter years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. \nAnd they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. \nOther gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. \nThe fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. \nUber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

      "text": "The foreign secretary has warned democracy is \"in retreat\", in a speech setting out his vision for the UK's role in the world. \nDominic Raab argued democracies face their greatest threat since the end of the Cold War. \nHe said that is why countries like Britain should try to be a \"force for good in the world\".\nIt comes as the government faces criticism over the UK's future relationship with China. \nThe Integrated Review of foreign and defence policy  set out by the government yesterday plans to increase the cap on the UK's stockpile of nuclear weapons.\nIt also said Britain would shift its focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, while pledging to tackle the \"systemic challenge\" of China.\nSpeaking to the US Aspen Security Forum, Mr Raab predicted in the next decade, the combined wealth of autocratic regimes is likely to exceed that of the world's democracies.\n\"Think about what that means for a second,\" he said.\n\"Tyranny is richer than freedom, and that matters to us here at home.\n\"Because stable, freedom-respecting democracies are much less likely to go to war, house terrorists or trigger large scale flows of migrants and they are generally, not always, but generally easier to trade with, and easier to cooperate with to solve our shared problems.\"\nHe said the UK has \"a moral responsibility and an indivisible stake in our planet, our global economy, our global ecosystem and the conditions of peace and stability that underpin them\".\nAnd he argued that the UK \"can and should help alleviate the worst suffering in the world\".\nResponding to the review on Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an \"era of retreat,\" with armed forces cuts \"every year for the last decade\".\nAnd he also said the UK's policy towards China had been \"inconsistent\" and accused the government of turning \"a blind eye\" to human rights abuses in the country.\nMeanwhile, Mr Raab has faced criticism after apparently telling officials the UK should trade with countries not meeting European Convention on Human Rights standards, in a leaked clip obtained by HuffPost UK. \nThe Foreign Office said the recording was selectively clipped to distort the comments of the foreign secretary who, it said, had emphasised the importance of promoting human rights.\nThe government is facing internal Conservative pressure to harden its stance on China over issues including its clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. \nThe review said the UK should \"continue to pursue a positive trade and investment relationship\" with the country - prompting some criticism from backbenchers. \nSenior Tory Julian Lewis took issue with its description of China as a \"partner,\" adding it suggested suggested the \"grasping naivety\" of the party's approach under David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, \"still lingers on\".\nBut giving evidence to a Lords committee on Wednesday, Mr Osborne defended his approach, arguing the UK should not take a \"dramatically different\" stance on Chinese investment. \nHe told peers the UK was \"more likely to get a hearing\" over its human rights concerns by \"engaging\" with China economically. \nHe added that forcing China to \"engage with the world\" was likely to improve British security in the long-run.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also defended the government's approach, arguing that to \"pull up the drawbridge\" would not be \"productive\" when it comes to rights issues. \n\"You can trade with a country and at the same time make very strong representations about their mistreatment of minorities and their human rights abuses,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme.

      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Universities in England are being warned against admitting too many students and swamping courses with \"inflated\" numbers this year.\nThe Office for Students (OfS) has told universities not to \"sacrifice quality\" by \"over-recruiting\" students.\nThere is uncertainty about how many students might get good A-level grades, with teachers' grades being used for exams cancelled in the pandemic.\nUniversities UK said admissions decisions would be \"fair and flexible\".\nNick Hillman of the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) said \"rather than beating up on universities\", there should be an acceptance of an \"unstoppable\" rising demand for university places this year - and that capacity should be expanded.\nAs well as the possibility of higher A-level results from teachers' grades, there has been an 8% increase in university applications this year - raising the prospect of a surge of well-qualified students looking for places.\nThe OfS has warned universities against accepting too many, which could leave students facing \"further disappointment because the quality of their course is reduced by over-recruitment and poor organisation\".\nHead teachers have raised concerns that pushy parents - with \"pointy elbows and lawyer friends\" - will try to pressure teachers into boosting their children's grades for university places.\nAnd the OfS has cautioned that an increase in pupils with top A-level grades should not lead to universities cherry picking high-flying applicants in a way that is socially exclusive.\n\"Universities and colleges are likely to have many well-qualified students to choose from,\" said OfS chief executive Nicola Dandridge.\n\"We can't have a situation where talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds lose out as a result.\"\nThe university watchdog also highlighted a form of \"unconditional offer\" being used this year.\nIt warned that universities had promised \"large numbers\" of places on the basis of teachers' predicted grades - and if predicted grades were high enough that would guarantee a place, regardless of the outcome of exams.\n\"We will be investigating these instances further and have powers to impose fines where our rules have been breached,\" says the OfS.\nThis year will see teachers both deciding A-level predictions for university applications and then submitting grades for the results.\nUniversities will be expected to honour any offers made to students - even if more students get the required grades than expected.\nIn the confusion of last year's replacement exams, there was a significant increase in high A-level grades - and the Ucas admissions service said it meant the \"most selective universities accepting over 12,000 additional students\".\n\"Clearly there is further uncertainty this year, but universities are aware that grade outcomes may be more generous than previous years,\" said a Ucas spokeswoman.\nA report from the Social Market Foundation also highlighted tensions over places between universities and further education colleges - and the risk of \"head-to-head student recruitment battles\".\nThe think tank report warned of \"turf wars\" over vocational courses below degree level - and called for more clarity over the roles of higher and further education.\nUniversities UK said admissions decisions this year would take into account \"the disruption students have faced and recognise the disadvantage that different groups of students have experienced\".\n\"University admissions teams have worked incredibly hard throughout the pandemic and they are continuing to pull out all the stops,\" said a spokeswoman."

      "tags": "ScotRail",
      "text": "Scotland's train services are to be run by a public sector body, the Scottish government has announced. \nDutch firm Abellio will stop running the ScotRail franchise at the end of March next year.\nAfter this an \"arms-length\" Scottish government company will take over the running of services. \nAbellio has been running the franchise since 2015 but had its contract ended early amid criticism over cancellations and performance levels.\nAll ScotRail staff will transfer to the new Scottish government-owned entity. \nThe arrangement is being made under powers which allow the Scottish government to take over the rail franchise without a bidding process. \nTransport Secretary Michael Matheson said he was not able to say how long these \"operator of last resort\" arrangements would last for.  \nHe said: \"I have decided that it would not be appropriate to award a franchise agreement to any party at this time, either through a competition or a direct award.\n\"That is why I have confirmed that, from the expiry of the current franchise, ScotRail services will be provided in public hands through a company wholly owned and controlled by the Scottish government.  \n\"This approach will provide a stable platform for ScotRail services and certainty for passengers and staff.\"\nScotland's railways have already been temporarily nationalised since March last year to help the service cope with the impact of coronavirus.\nThe Scottish government has spent \u00a3452m in support for ScotRail, along with the Caledonian Sleeper, after passenger numbers dropped dramatically as a result of lockdown restrictions.\nMr Matheson described Abellio's time in charge of ScotRail as \"a difficult period\" which had confirmed the franchise system was \"broken and not working in the taxpayers' interest\".\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"There have been periods where they have under-performed, which has resulted in us having to take direct action.\n\"It's also a time when we have seen our rail network expand, with more new trains... and a greater range of services to the travelling public.\n\"So it's been very much a mixed report card that we would give to Abellio, but one that we did not believe lived up to our aspirations.\"\nMr Matheson said passengers would get better value for money under the new set-up \"because it will effectively cut out the company\" which has been running the system.\nThis includes the company's \"considerable\" management costs, he said.\nKevin Lindsay, Scottish organiser of train driver union Aslef, said: \"We welcome the beginning of the end of the failed franchise system here in Scotland. \n\"However, never again should people's railway ever be in the hands of the privateers. \n\"It's now for all us in the railway to build a railway that's accessible, affordable, and safe for the people of Scotland.\"\nThe TSSA union said: \"This announcement is long overdue - much like many ScotRail trains were whilst Abellio was in charge.\"\nThe RMT union said public ownership would deliver significant benefits for Scotland's rail workers, passengers and taxpayers.\nThe \"operator of last resort\" model that the Scottish government will use is currently being used by the UK government to run the East Coast franchise by means of the arms-length London North Eastern Railway company. \nIn Wales, day-to-day services are being run by a publicly-owned company after a significant fall in passenger numbers during the Covid pandemic. \nScottish Tory transport spokesman Graham Simpson\u00a0said: \"The SNP government must be entirely honest about how much this will cost taxpayers and clear about what demonstrable benefits it is expected to bring to passengers.\n\"It is important that this is being motivated by pragmatism\u00a0not ideology.\n\"This is the same government that can't even build a couple of ferries which hardly instils confidence in them having the competence to run a rail service.\" \nScottish Greens transport spokesman John Finnie said the announcement was \"welcome progress\".\nHe said: \"Given Wales brought railways into public ownership last year, this has been a long time coming. \n\"Nationalisation of services is just the first step towards a greener, integrated public transport system which serves communities not shareholders.\"\nScottish Labour's transport spokesman Alex Rowley said: \"When SNP ministers awarded the contract to Abellio they told us we would have world leading services but for far too many that was not the experience.\n\"The Scottish government could have acted on this much earlier, and it is their repeated failures that have led us to this point.\"\nA statement from ScotRail posted to Twitter said: \"We want to reassure you that we'll keep operating a reliable service to support the vaccine rollout and the opening up of the economy over the coming months.\"We'll work closely with Transport Scotland to ensure a smooth transition to the new operator, to deliver stability for customers and railway staff.\"\nPrivatisation of the railways in the 1990s was both radical and controversial.\nEven some who had supported the privatisations of other state-owned assets such as BT and the electricity companies questioned whether breaking up British Rail and offering businesses franchises to run services would actually work out for the best.\nThey seemed to be proved right. The company that owned the lines, Railtrack, was brought back into public ownership as Network Rail. Some franchises proved unsuccessful or unviable so the state stepped in to keep the trains running. \nThe ScotRail franchise, despite plenty of controversies, was relatively free of trouble and has been operated by three separate companies over the years -  Abellio now looks set to be the last.\nIn many ways though, Scotland's railways were more like a public private partnership than a business simply driven by the market. The Scottish government supported big improvements to the line between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the reopening of the Waverley Line in the borders. \nFor some, the renationalisation of Scotland's railway service will be seen as right or wrong as a mere point of principle. But the test for many passengers will be whether it results in better services or a greater degree of accountability."

      "text": "It's a longstanding mystery: how Mars lost the water that flowed across its surface billions of years ago.\nScientists now think they have an answer: much of it became trapped in the planet's outer layer - its crust.\nThe ancient water exists in the form of minerals contained within Martian rocks.\nThe findings have been discussed at the 52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference and are published in Science journal.\nThe study used measurements gathered from Mars-orbiting spacecraft, rovers and meteorites.\nResearchers then developed a computer simulation of how water was lost from the planet over time.\nMore than four billion years ago, Mars was warmer and wetter - possibly with a thicker atmosphere. Water coursed through rivers, cutting channels in the rock, and pooled in impact craters.\nThe Red Planet could have held enough water to cover its entire surface in a layer measuring between 100m and one kilometre deep.\nAround a billion years later, Mars had made the transition to the colder, desolate planet we recognise today.\n\"We have known for a long time that Mars was much wetter in its early history. But, the exact fate of that water has been an ongoing problem,\" said planetary scientist Dr Peter Grindrod, who was not involved with the latest study.\nDr Grindrod, from London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News: \"We already know from studies of the atmosphere of Mars that some of that water was lost to space, and ice deposits on and just below the surface tell us that some water became frozen.\"\nEarth has a magnetic shield, or magnetosphere, that helps prevent the atmosphere from escaping. But Mars' magnetic shield is weak and could have allowed elemental components of water to escape from the planet.\nBut the rate at which hydrogen - one chemical constituent of water - escapes from that atmosphere today suggests this can't be the whole story.\nIf it's assumed that the current loss rate for hydrogen was the same in the past, \"it's a pretty small amount of water that you would have lost through this escape process\", said co-author Eva Linghan Scheller, from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. \nIn other words, most of the water must have gone elsewhere.\nThe results of the team's computer modelling work show that between 30% and 99% of Mars' initial water was incorporated into minerals and buried in the planet's crust.\nCo-author Prof Bethany Ehlmann, also from from Caltech, explained that, \"by studying data from Mars missions, It became clear that it was common - and not rare - to find evidence of water alteration\". \nShe continued: \"When the crust becomes altered, it takes water - like liquid water - and sequesters it in a hydrated mineral that has water in its structure so that it is effectively trapped.\"\nThe authors suggest that most of the water was lost between about 4.1 and 3.7 billion years ago - during a stretch of Martian history known as the Noachian Period. \nDr Michael Meyer, lead scientist for Nasa's Mars exploration program, said: \"The original overarching role of Mars exploration has been to follow the water, since it plays such a central role in the geology, climate and life of the planet.\n\"This is a very important paper to understand how much water was on Mars, how it might have been lost and where it might be today.\"\nDr Grindrod added: \"What this new study tells us is that a lot of that water, possibly the majority, could have actually been locked into the rocks on Mars. This process of hydration is capable of storing large volumes of water, up to an amount equivalent to a global layer a kilometre deep.\"\n\"Although most of the liquid water had probably disappeared after about one and a half billion years after Mars formed, we see evidence of hydrated minerals at the surface today, in areas like Jezero Crater, which is currently being explored by the Perseverance rover. \n\"The early climate of Mars remains one of the most important topics in planetary science, and this study will help our understanding of the processes responsible for water loss.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "St Patrick's Day celebrations will once again be different this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin have been cancelled for the second year in a row, with many events across the island again moving online. \nPolice have warned that anyone breaking Covid-19 regulations in NI will face a \"robust\" response.\nBut while large gatherings are mostly ruled out, attempts have been made to celebrate in style around the world.\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, a record number of places are taking part.\nSome 670 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nThe quirkiest additions to this year's list include an abandoned sauna in Finland and a Smurf statue in Brussels.\nHere's how other places in Northern Ireland and further afield are planning to mark the occasion:\nBelfast has an array of virtual events for people to enjoy from the comfort of their own homes throughout the month of March.\nAn online disco, Irish language festivals and a virtual guided tour of the city's street art are just some of the events on offer.\nSeveral live music events will also be streamed throughout St Patrick's Day, showcasing the city's talent. \nSt Joseph's Church in Sailortown is one such venue celebrating with an eight-hour live-streamed event.\nThe St Patrick's Centre in Downpatrick, County Down is celebrating with a number of online events for St Patrick's Day and also to mark its 20 year anniversary.\nA new show about St Patrick, a children's virtual art competition and a series of podcasts from former BBC politics correspondent Martina Purdy and ex-barrister Elaine Kelly, who are pilgrim guides on the new St Patrick's Way, are just some of the events on offer.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Purdy said that some of the guests involved on the podcast are journalist and presenter Eamonn Holmes, as well as Irish cellist Patrick Dexter, who has found online fame with his open-air recitals, shot outside his cottage in County Mayo. \n\"I was probably less aggressive than I was previously with some politicians,\" she said.\nIt is claimed that St Patrick is buried outside Downpatrick Cathedral. A large granite stone marks the spot, placed there in the early 20th century.\nThe council's Spring and St Patrick's Day programme promises to \"bring some colour\" to the city and district, according to mayor Brian Tierney.\nHe thanked event organisers for a programme that \"strikes a balance between giving the public something to look forward to and celebrate, while also keeping everyone safe\".\nEvent organiser Jacqueline Whoriskey said: \"While we will not be holding any public events or gatherings, we have focused in on how we can creatively bring the spring spirit to our streets with artwork and installations, with fairy dwellings and artistic sculptures that can be enjoyed by everyone when out getting some fresh air and exercise\".\nArmagh's At Home With St Patrick Festival includes events such as online wreath making and an Irish dancing master class. \nAll events are free of charge, however, some do require registration in advance.\nThe council is marking Irish Language Week and St Patrick's Day with a series of online performances and storytelling.\nAll events have moved online and the festival includes music and dance performances, streamed live from the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh and the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen.\nThe council is streaming a series of craft workshops, musical entertainment and dance performances live on social media channels throughout the day. \nPolice in Northern Ireland have appealed for anyone celebrating St Patrick's Day to ensure that they adhere to all public health regulations.\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland on Wednesday, through to the early hours of Thursday.\nThe substantial policing operation will see officers patrolling beauty spots and the Holyland area of south Belfast.\nPolice said that a number of gatherings have already been broken up by officers in south Belfast ahead of St Patrick's Day.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that people know the rules and those breaking them could face fines.\nSaint Patrick lived in the 5th Century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nWhile St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nThe city's St Patrick's Festival runs from 12 to 17 March, with more than 100 online events around the theme of Awaken Ireland.\nOrganisers have partnered with Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 for the virtual parade.\nThe celebrations will be broadcast around the world to a potential audience of 80 million people, organisers said.\nThe Queen has extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.\"\nPresident Michael D Higgins said that the British monarch's visit in 2011 was \"such a moment of healing\" and expressed his appreciation for her \"good wishes on our national day\". \nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition will continue this year, albeit virtually. The bowl will be placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders will discuss, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland, according to the White House.\nMr Biden, who has strong links to Mayo and Carlingford, will no doubt want to celebrate his Irish roots. \nBefore a visit to the land of his forefathers in 2016, the then US vice-president said: \"Being Irish, without fear of contradiction, has shaped my entire life.\"\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River event but the city's mayor was determined to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nChicago's mayor Lori Lightfoot tweeted: \"Happy St. Patrick's Day Weekend, Chicago! Although we didn't gather, we were able to honor long-standing tradition by dyeing the Chicago River green, thanks to the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers.\""

      "text": "The prime minister's former aide, Dominic Cummings, has criticised the Department of Health as \"a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE\" at the start of the pandemic.\nHe said that was why Boris Johnson had taken direct control of the vaccine programme.\nHe also told MPs Mr Johnson approached him about working in Downing Street the week before he took office. \nHe said he asked him to \"help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare\".\nMr Cummings said he agreed but one of his preconditions was that science funding should be doubled. \nHe was giving evidence to MPs on the Science and Technology Committee about the creation of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency know as Aria. \nBut in his first public appearance since leaving office, he also criticised the health department's response to the pandemic. \nHe said: \"In spring 2020 you had a situation where the Department for Health was just a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE and all of that, you had serious problems with the funding bureaucracy for therapeutics on Covid.\"\nHe said the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had advised Number 10 that the vaccine rollout should not be run out of the Department for Health and that a separate task force should be created.\n\"It's not coincidental that the vaccine programme worked the way it did. It's not coincidental that to do that we had to take it out of the Department of Health,\" he added.\n\"We had to have it authorised very directly by the prime minister and say strip away all the normal nonsense that we can see is holding back funding.\"\nBut a source at the health department told the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming that getting the vaccine programme established was a \"massive team effort\". \nThey added: \"Everyone in DHSC was and is spending their time focused on saving lives, expanding the world leading vaccine rollout and getting through this pandemic.\"\nThe Vaccine Taskforce is a team of almost 200 people at the Department for Business that was established to make sure the UK got promising vaccines.\nMr Cummings said as the country emerges from lockdown there needs to be an \"urgent very, very hard look\" by Parliament at \"what went wrong and why\" during the pandemic.\n\"One of the most obvious lessons is the incredible value potentially of getting science and technology stuff right, the disaster that can come if you don't get it right.\"\nIt was this \"horrific Whitehall bureaucracy\" he wanted to strip away when he championed the new \"high risk\" Aria scientific research agency, he told MPs.\nHe said: \"The prime minister came to speak to me the Sunday before he became prime minister and said: 'Would I come in to Downing Street to try and help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare?'.\n\"I said, yes, if first of all you are deadly serious about actually getting Brexit done and avoiding a second referendum; secondly, double the science budget; third, create some Aria like entity, and fourth  support me in trying to change how Whitehall works and the Cabinet Office works because it is a disaster zone. And he said 'deal'.\"\nAnswering MPs' questions about science funding, Mr Cummings said scientists had been lobbying for the creation of a body such as Aria that would have \"extreme freedom\" but he said he was aware that this was \"completely hostile to normal bureaucracy\". \nThe government says Aria will fund \"high-risk, high-reward\" scientific research and \"help to cement the UK's position as a global science superpower\".\nIt will be run along the lines of US equivalents that were instrumental in the creation of the internet and GPS.\nAria, which has \u00a3800m funding over four years, will have a \"higher tolerance for failure than is normal\", ministers say.\nBut the amount of funding it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).\nFor 2020-21, the government has allocated \u00a310.36bn for its research programmes and bodies.\nLabour said there needed to be greater transparency around how the agency would operate.\nLabour MP Dawn Butler, who sits on the science committee, said because Aria was exempt from freedom of information requests this would undoubtedly \"raise alarm bells\" about how taxpayers' money would be spent given \"the recent PPE scandals\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the \"corporate governance arrangements are very robust\". \nHe added he would be responsible for reporting to Parliament on Aria and that the agency would have to submit accounts that would be scrutinised by MPs. \n\"I think there will be a great deal of transparency and oversight,\" he added. \nAt the start of the hearing, chair Greg Clark said Mr Cummings had agreed to give evidence on the Covid pandemic to a joint inquiry by the science and health committees."

      "text": "Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted.\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\nThat date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that \"brighter days are ahead of us\".\nThe \"stay at home\" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to \"stay local\" for a further three weeks.\nOther changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April.\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that:\nA decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept \"under ongoing review\".\nShe told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest.\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\".\nHowever, she said she was \"optimistic\" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues.\n\"This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,\" she said.\nRestrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or \"as soon as possible thereafter\".\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus.\nShe said that \"our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that\" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place \"for some time to come\".\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome.\nHowever, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments.\nAnd she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can \"get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear\".\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed \"effective testing and tracing\" systems to keep infections low.\nHe called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that \"transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close\".\nData not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland.\nThe first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored.\nWhen Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic.\nToday, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme.\nBut the first minister said this was the \"most hopeful\" she had felt for a long time and that \"something much closer to actual normality\" might be achieved as we move into summer.\nThe change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown.\nMs Sturgeon said the government had to make \"careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions\" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving \"steadily and in one direction\".\nThe final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the \"need for medium term-support\". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year.\nScottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was \"most welcome for everyone\", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission\", and that \"we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can\".\nScottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the \"indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area\".\nThe first minister said everything was \"predicated on the data going in the right direction\", and that \"all bets are off\" if case numbers rise sharply again.\nShe told MSPs that her \"hope and ambition\" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "People aged 50 and over in England are now being invited to book their appointment for a Covid vaccine.\nThis is the final group on the priority list, which covers 99% of those at high risk of dying from Covid-19.\nEveryone in the top nine priority groups should be offered a second dose by mid-July, up to 12 weeks after the first.\nNearly half of the UK adult population has had one vaccine dose - more than 25 million people.\nAround 1.7 million people have also had a second dose. \nIn Northern Ireland and some areas of Scotland, the over-50s are already being offered a Covid vaccine. Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April.\nIn total, the number of people who have had one vaccine dose is:\nThe number of vaccines given this week in the UK is expected to top four million - nearly double what has been achieved per week recently - thanks to a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India.\nThis could mean all those aged 50 and over will be offered one dose by the end of March, putting the NHS rollout two weeks ahead of schedule.\nAfter that, the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated, with people prioritised by age. \nAll adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\nIt is 100 days since Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to be vaccinated against Covid outside of clinical trials.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"I'm determined no-one should miss out on the chance to protect themselves and urge everyone who is eligible to come forward.\"\nDr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS England's primary care director, said vaccine supplies would go up and down over the next few months linked to manufacturers' ability to supply their jabs.\n\"But this week and next we have larger supplies, so we want anyone in the top priority groups - people aged 50 and older as well as those working in health and care and anyone with an underlying health condition - to come forward soon to protect themselves and their loved ones,\" she said. \nTwo million text messages are being sent out to those aged 50-54 in England with a link allowing people to book an appointment through the national booking service website.\nPeople who cannot go online can call the service on 119.\nThe expansion of the Covid vaccine rollout comes after government reassurance that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - one of two being given to people in the UK - was safe, after 13 countries paused their use of it.\nExpect a surge in vaccinations in the next week or so. Extra supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine have arrived from abroad to supplement existing stocks.\nThe target to offer a vaccine to all those aged 50 and over by mid-April will almost certainly be met ahead of schedule. It will then be the turn of younger adults.\nThe progress means the UK is easing restrictions as parts of Europe face new waves of infection.\nConcerns have been raised about safety of the AstraZeneca jab - the European regulator is investigating cases of blood clots, focusing on a rare type that affects the brain.\nEvidence from 10 million doses given in the UK show there have been three cases - none fatal.\nThis is not above the level you would expect to happen normally, suggesting coincidence rather than cause. \nIn Germany the numbers are higher - but because these events are so rare, it's easy for a couple of cases to raise alarm.\nIt's understandable they are being investigated, but what has baffled experts is why some nations have paused rollout in the meantime.\nAfter all, this vaccine saves lives. That's why authorities here say it's safe and even the European regulator says vaccination should continue.  \nThe EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of rare blood clots in a tiny number of vaccinated people on Thursday.\nBut the UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, and Downing Street has said there is no evidence to suggest the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is linked to the clots.\nMr Hancock urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\" as soon as they got the opportunity.\nA vaccine safety panel of the World Health Organization said it was \"carefully assessing the latest available data\" for the vaccine but, in the meantime, recommended that vaccinations should continue.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard. A further 5,758 people tested positive."

      "tags": "ScotRail",
      "text": "Scotland's train services are to be run by a public sector body, the Scottish government has announced. \nDutch firm Abellio will stop running the ScotRail franchise at the end of March next year.\nAfter this an \"arms-length\" Scottish government company will take over the running of services. \nAbellio has been running the franchise since 2015 but had its contract ended early amid criticism over cancellations and performance levels.\nAll ScotRail staff will transfer to the new Scottish government-owned entity. \nThe arrangement is being made under powers which allow the Scottish government to take over the rail franchise without a bidding process. \nTransport Secretary Michael Matheson said he was not able to say how long these \"operator of last resort\" arrangements would last for.  \nHe said: \"I have decided that it would not be appropriate to award a franchise agreement to any party at this time, either through a competition or a direct award.\n\"That is why I have confirmed that, from the expiry of the current franchise, ScotRail services will be provided in public hands through a company wholly owned and controlled by the Scottish government.  \n\"This approach will provide a stable platform for ScotRail services and certainty for passengers and staff.\"\nScotland's railways have already been temporarily nationalised since March last year to help the service cope with the impact of coronavirus.\nThe Scottish government has spent \u00a3452m in support for ScotRail, along with the Caledonian Sleeper, after passenger numbers dropped dramatically as a result of lockdown restrictions.\nMr Matheson described Abellio's time in charge of ScotRail as \"a difficult period\" which had confirmed the franchise system was \"broken and not working in the taxpayers' interest\".\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"There have been periods where they have under-performed, which has resulted in us having to take direct action.\n\"It's also a time when we have seen our rail network expand, with more new trains... and a greater range of services to the travelling public.\n\"So it's been very much a mixed report card that we would give to Abellio, but one that we did not believe lived up to our aspirations.\"\nMr Matheson said passengers would get better value for money under the new set-up \"because it will effectively cut out the company\" which has been running the system.\nThis includes the company's \"considerable\" management costs, he said.\nKevin Lindsay, Scottish organiser of train driver union Aslef, said: \"We welcome the beginning of the end of the failed franchise system here in Scotland. \n\"However, never again should people's railway ever be in the hands of the privateers. \n\"It's now for all us in the railway to build a railway that's accessible, affordable, and safe for the people of Scotland.\"\nThe TSSA union said: \"This announcement is long overdue - much like many ScotRail trains were whilst Abellio was in charge.\"\nThe RMT union said public ownership would deliver significant benefits for Scotland's rail workers, passengers and taxpayers.\nThe \"operator of last resort\" model that the Scottish government will use is currently being used by the UK government to run the East Coast franchise by means of the arms-length London North Eastern Railway company. \nIn Wales, day-to-day services are being run by a publicly-owned company after a significant fall in passenger numbers during the Covid pandemic. \nScottish Tory transport spokesman Graham Simpson\u00a0said: \"The SNP government must be entirely honest about how much this will cost taxpayers and clear about what demonstrable benefits it is expected to bring to passengers.\n\"It is important that this is being motivated by pragmatism\u00a0not ideology.\n\"This is the same government that can't even build a couple of ferries which hardly instils confidence in them having the competence to run a rail service.\" \nScottish Greens transport spokesman John Finnie said the announcement was \"welcome progress\".\nHe said: \"Given Wales brought railways into public ownership last year, this has been a long time coming. \n\"Nationalisation of services is just the first step towards a greener, integrated public transport system which serves communities not shareholders.\"\nScottish Labour's transport spokesman Alex Rowley said: \"When SNP ministers awarded the contract to Abellio they told us we would have world leading services but for far too many that was not the experience.\n\"The Scottish government could have acted on this much earlier, and it is their repeated failures that have led us to this point.\"\nA statement from ScotRail posted to Twitter said: \"We want to reassure you that we'll keep operating a reliable service to support the vaccine rollout and the opening up of the economy over the coming months.\"We'll work closely with Transport Scotland to ensure a smooth transition to the new operator, to deliver stability for customers and railway staff.\"\nPrivatisation of the railways in the 1990s was both radical and controversial.\nEven some who had supported the privatisations of other state-owned assets such as BT and the electricity companies questioned whether breaking up British Rail and offering businesses franchises to run services would actually work out for the best.\nThey seemed to be proved right. The company that owned the lines, Railtrack, was brought back into public ownership as Network Rail. Some franchises proved unsuccessful or unviable so the state stepped in to keep the trains running. \nThe ScotRail franchise, despite plenty of controversies, was relatively free of trouble and has been operated by three separate companies over the years -  Abellio now looks set to be the last.\nIn many ways though, Scotland's railways were more like a public private partnership than a business simply driven by the market. The Scottish government supported big improvements to the line between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the reopening of the Waverley Line in the borders. \nFor some, the renationalisation of Scotland's railway service will be seen as right or wrong as a mere point of principle. But the test for many passengers will be whether it results in better services or a greater degree of accountability."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has promised to help make the UK \"match-fit\" when he unveils his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy.\nThe prime minister said there would be \"more investment\" in infrastructure and skills around the country.\nHe also announced that 500 Foreign Office jobs would be moving from London to East Kilbride. \nThe government publishes its Integrated Review of the UK's defence and foreign relations capabilities on Tuesday.\nBut a group of MPs has warned that \"general ineptitude\" over the last 20 years has undermined attempts to re-equip the Army. \nThe Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat. \nSome details are being pre-released, including the plan to move 500 jobs to the Foreign Office's East Kilbride hub - which follows news that the Cabinet Office will transfer at least 500 civil servants to nearby Glasgow by 2024.\nThe government has promised \"further commitments\" to \"strengthening the UK's core industrial base\" in the Integrated Review, including building ships in Scotland and armoured vehicles in Wales.\nThere will also be a focus on lithium mining in Cornwall and manufacturing satellites in Northern Ireland, it added. \nThe Integrated Review is billed as the most radical reassessment of Britain's place in the world since the end of the Cold War.\nBut the prime minister wants the new strategy to make a difference at home as well as abroad. He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology.\nAnd, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom.\nMinisters argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad.\nThe test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland. \nMr Johnson said: \"The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people. \n\"So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people.\"\nHe added that the UK's \"international ambitions must start at home\", with investment in regional industry \"ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world\".\nThe government has said \"further jobs\" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England.\nIt has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\nFrom 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by \u00a36.6bn in real terms, but, since then, it has increased by \u00a33bn in real terms.\nA report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at \"serious risk\" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries.\nIt described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as \"woeful\" and criticised what it called \"bureaucratic procrastination\" and \"general ineptitude\" over the past two decades.\nIn a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are\".\nHe added that unless it confirmed a reduction in potential dangers to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\"."

      "text": "Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest computer-chip manufacturer, has warned of a \u201cserious imbalance\u201d in the semiconductor industry, as global shortages cause disruption.\nIt also said it might skip the launch of the next Galaxy Note smartphone, to streamline its lineup.\nThere are growing fears market shortages could slow economic recovery after coronavirus.\nEU, US and Chinese governments are seeking to boost production.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally,\u201d Samsung's co-chief executive and mobile chief, Koh Dong-jin, said at a shareholder meeting.\n\"It is hard to say the shortage issue has been solved 100%.\"\nSamsung was working with overseas partners to meet demand, he added.\nThe semiconductor shortage began last year, as the pandemic hit. \nSuffering from poor sales, car manufacturers cut their orders from the Chinese factories making computer chips.\nIn response, the chip supply from factories was transferred to other sectors that had high demands.\nAnd unable to retrieve cancelled orders when demand for cars grew, Volkswagen, Honda, Toyota and General Motors all had to reduce production. \nMeanwhile, as technology sales boomed, with people staying at home, the other sectors were also affected.\nNew graphics cards were scarce, Apple staggered the release of some iPhones, and the latest models of Xbox and PlayStation consoles are selling out each time a new stock is announced.\n\"The semiconductor manufacturers are working hard to fill the gaps in supply,\" Counterpoint Research partner Peter Richardson said.\n\"But it will take time before investment translates to more supply. \n\"This means that shortages for some products may continue for several months - possibly even in to 2022.\"\nHowever, most consumers were unlikely to feel the impact, unless buying a new car, he added.\nSamsung's release of a new Galaxy Note smartphone may now be delayed until 2022, Mr Koh signalled.\nAs a high-end model, \u201cit might be difficult to release\u201d, he said.\nAnother popular model, the Samsung Galaxy S21, was launched in January. \n\u201cIt could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year,\u201d Mr Koh added. \nQuilter Cheviot research analyst Ben Barringer said: \"Growing trade tensions between the US and China put the semiconductor industry in uncertainty, even before the pandemic.\n\"This shortage illustrates how important certain countries have become in terms of supply chain - and how important access to semiconductors is.\"\nAnd last month's closure of its chip-fabrication plant by adverse weather conditions in Texas had exacerbated Samsung's problems.\nTaiwanese research firm TrendForce estimated the shutdown could reduce global smartphone production by 5% in the second quarter of this year.\n\"They are trying to differentiate between absolute demands and nice-to-haves,\" Mr Barringer added."

      "text": "A former police chief has said she would think \"very carefully\" about reporting a crime committed against her because of how she would be \"judged\". \nSusannah Fish, former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, said there was a \"toxic culture of sexism\" in significant parts of policing.\nBut the police chiefs' body said women who came forward would be listened to.\nIt comes after the killing of Sarah Everard sparked concerns for women's safety in public. \nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Ms Fish was asked how she felt about reporting a crime to the police as a woman. \nShe replied that while reporting a crime against property was \"not an issue\", for a crime against herself she would \"probably struggle for how I would be judged\". \nMs Fish added that while some officers would be \"sensitive\", others would not. \n\"I also know in terms of conviction rates and the challenges of going through the criminal justice system, as a woman, it's thankless,\" she said. \n\"Endless repeated humiliation, telling your story over and over again, worrying whether you're ever going to be believed, putting yourself through that repeatedly, as well as the shame of what's happened to you.\"\nShe added that victim-blaming had become \"endemic\" and \"trying to then explain yourself and justify yourself, just feels to me to be incredibly difficult\".\nHowever, Olivia Pinkney, chief constable of Hampshire Police and representing the National Police Chiefs' Council, told the programme: \"When women have the courage to come forward to anyone, including the police, then they will be listened to, they will be heard, they will be supported.\n\"I know that happens, because I know that we follow up every case.\"\nShe added: \"I'm sure that we get stuff wrong. But if we get it wrong, then we'll hear about it and we'll fix it.\" \nOn Monday, Ms Fish described the Met Police response to a vigil for Ms Everard last weekend as \"institutional\" misogyny. \nThe force faced criticism over its handling of the vigil, where officers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Clapham Common in south London. \nThe home secretary has commissioned an independent investigation into the force's decisions, which were taken in the light of Covid restrictions.\nMet Commissioner Cressida Dick said she agreed on the need for a \"sober review\" but defended how officers responded to the \"really big crowd\".\nMs Everard, 33, went missing while walking home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in Kent woodland and a Met Police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder. \nAsked what she meant by institutional misogyny in the way the police handled the vigil, Ms Fish told Woman's Hour that while there were \"many good people\" in policing, it was about the \"mindset\" and \"culture\" of the institution and how decisions were made. \n\"I think there is still significant parts of policing where there is a very toxic culture of sexism, of misogyny that objectifies women,\" she added. \nUnder Ms Fish's leadership, Nottinghamshire Police was the first force to record misogyny as a hate crime in 2016."

      "text": "The UK is set to reverse plans to reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by the middle of the decade, as part of a foreign policy overhaul. \nThe overall cap on the number of warheads will now increase to 260, having been due to drop to 180 under previous plans from 2010.\nThe UK will shift focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, described as the world's \"growth engine\".\nAnd it pledges the UK will do more on the \"systemic challenge\" of China.\nOutlining the strategy to MPs, Boris Johnson said the UK would have to \"relearn the art\" of competing against countries with \"opposing values\".\nBut he added the UK would remain \"unswervingly committed\" to the Nato defence alliance and preserving peace and security in Europe.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an \"era of retreat,\" with armed forces cuts \"every year for the last decade\".\nThe integrated review of foreign and defence policies, which runs to over 100 pages, has taken over a year and sets out UK priorities until 2030.\nThe UK nuclear stockpile is estimated to comprise 195 warheads, and had been due to fall to 180 by the mid-2020s under a 2010 defence review.\nBut the latest assessment says this ambition is \"no longer possible\" given the \"evolving security environment\" over the last decade. \nIt adds that the UK will no longer publish figures on the size of its operational stockpile, to maintain \"deliberate ambiguity\" for adversaries. \nHowever, it pledges the UK will maintain the \"minimum destructive power needed to guarantee that the UK's nuclear deterrent remains credible\".\nThe review, which identifies Russia as the \"most acute threat\" to UK security, also says:\nThe review also pledged to reverse cuts on foreign aid, from 0.7% of national income down to 0.5%, when \"the fiscal situation allows\".\nThe government has previously faced criticism for the cuts, which it said were necessary in the wake of financial challenges posed by the Covid pandemic.\nThe review argues the UK should refocus its foreign policy towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia in the \"Indo-Pacific\" region.\nIt said the region's shipping lanes were vital to maintain UK trade with Asia, whilst the region is also on the \"frontline of new security challenges\".\nAnalysis by Rob Watson, BBC World Service UK Political Correspondent\nWhat's striking about the review is the continuity in UK foreign policy.  \nSo just as before Brexit and \"Global Britain\", the UK continues to see the main threats to its security as China, Russia, terrorism and cyber attacks.  And it continues to have as its main goals, among other things, the promotion of democracy, free trade, human rights and the fight against climate change. \nThere are differences, though. The most striking is the suggestion of a pivot away from Europe to the Indo-Pacific.\nBut exactly what that means is not spelled out (although we do know Boris Johnson will travel to India next month, and there will be new focus on new partnerships and trade agreements with south-east Asian countries).\nMore broadly, Mr Johnson's central claim is that leaving the EU will make the UK more nimble and flexible, whether it's in how to deal with China or becoming a science superpower or anything else.  \nCritics will say the review is long on aspiration and that the UK will face the same global challenges it faced before Brexit - but with one fewer foreign policy tool in its toolbox, namely its membership of the EU.  \nMr Johnson said: \"The review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values.\"\nHe said the UK had led international condemnation of China's \"mass detention\" of Uighur people in Xinjiang, and its actions in Hong Kong, adding: \"There is no question China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours.\"\nIn response, Sir Keir said UK policy towards China had been \"inconsistent\" and the government had \"turned a blind eye\" to the country's human rights abuses.\nHe said Labour remained committed to retaining nuclear weapons, but said the document had failed to detail the \"strategic purpose\" for increasing the warhead stockpile.\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the review demonstrated \"just how hollow the brand of Global Britain is\".\nHe also asked the prime minister \"who gave his government the democratic right to renege on the UK's obligations under the nuclear proliferation treaty\" referring to the government's plans on nuclear weapons.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Beatrice Fihn - head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons -  described the UK's decision to change its nuclear provision as \"outrageous, irresponsible and very dangerous\".\nShe said it went against international law and didn't address the real security threats faced by Britain such as climate change and disinformation. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent \nThe review calls China the \"biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security\".\nBut there is clearly disquiet among the government's own MPs that it hasn't been robust enough in identifying the challenge posed by its Communist regime.  \nFormer Conservative foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was worried by its description of China as a \"systemic\" challenge, given its current clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. \nAnother senior Conservative, Julian Lewis, took issue with its description of China as a \"partner\".\nHe added it suggested the \"grasping naivety\" of the party's approach under David Cameron and George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, \"still lingers on\".\nBoris Johnson said there was a \"balance to be struck\", and although the UK wanted a \"strong trading relationship,\" it should be \"clear-eyed\" and \"tough where we see risk\".\nBut the trade-offs between seeking investment and protecting the UK from becoming too vulnerable to Chinese economic and political influence and pressure will come under increasing scrutiny.

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Public Accounts Committee,Homelessness,Homelessness in the UK,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A government scheme to house rough sleepers during the pandemic \"exposed the scale\" of the issue, say MPs.\nThe Public Accounts Committee praised the Everyone In initiative, brought in due to Covid, which took over 37,000 people off the streets by January 2021.\nBut they said the number was nearly nine times official estimates of rough sleepers, showing a \"much larger\" issue than the government had \"acknowledged\".\nThe government said it had \"ambitious plans\" to end rough sleeping.\nHowever, the committee expressed concern that the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government \"still does not have a plan\" to achieve this commitment. \nIn January, the National Audit Office called on the government to review its rough sleeping strategy in light of the figures from Everyone In, claiming it was \"out of step\" with the problem.\nEveryone In was an emergency scheme launched in March 2020 as the pandemic hit the country.\nIt saw local councils in England given an initial share of \u00a33.2m to provide accommodation for rough sleepers, often in hotels or hostels. \nOverall, councils in England have received over \u00a3700m to help tackle homelessness during 2020-21, including providing accommodation for rough sleepers.\nThe Everyone In programme received widespread praise for helping the vulnerable group and protecting them from coronavirus - with the committee saying it helped avert more than 20,000 infections. \nBut the group of MPs said it also showed how serious a problem rough sleeping was in the country. \nThe latest official estimate from the government of the number of people sleeping rough was 2,688, down from 4,266 in autumn 2019.\nBut the figure is based on a snapshot survey where councils in England either count rough sleepers on one night each year between 1 October and 30 November or give an estimate based on information from \"local agencies\", often charities.\nThe number also does not include people in night shelters or assessment centres, and could miss people sleeping hidden from view.\nThe estimate was far outstripped by the number of homeless people given accommodation through the Everyone In scheme over the course of the crisis, which hit 37,430 in January. \nAhead of the 2019 election, the Conservative Party pledged to end rough sleeping in England by the end of the Parliament in 2024. \nBut with the reality of the situation laid bare, the committee is concerned whether that target will be met, claiming a plan is not yet in place.\nLabour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said: \"Everyone In was a success with local authorities and voluntary organisations working to help people living on the street into hostels and hotel rooms in a matter of days. \n\"But the Everyone In initiative has exposed the scale of the task the Ministry of Housing faces to meet the government's commitment to end rough sleeping in three years.\" \nThe committee also questioned whether a government target to provide 3,300 homes for people sleeping rough by the end of March 2021 would be reached, accusing it of \"disappointing evasiveness\" around the plan. \nAnd it raised concerns over long term funding of local authorities, especially giving them permission to help people with no recourse to public funds - a term used for some immigrants who are not entitled to certain government benefits. \nMs Hillier added: \"Rough sleeping was a massive public health issue long before the pandemic, and much larger than government has previously publicly acknowledged. \n\"[The ministry] now has a huge opportunity to capitalise on this success in the pandemic response and begin to reverse its long record of failed and abandoned housing targets and policies.\n\"People without recourse to public funds are still left exposed and risk losing support. Support for these people is urgent.\"\nA spokeswoman for the government said it rejected the \"unfounded criticisms in this report\" arguing that the committee \"misuses different data to provide an inaccurate picture\".\nShe added that the government was providing \"over \u00a3700m this year and \u00a3750m next year\" to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.

      "text": "Countries around the world are celebrating St Patrick's Day on Wednesday, with online events replacing traditional parades.\nLandmarks across the globe turned green for the day in honour of Ireland's patron saint.\nLarge gatherings were ruled out in many parts of the world due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin were cancelled for the second year in a row.\nHowever events marking the day took place across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which are being streamed online.\nThey included an online disco and live music events in Belfast, while more than 100 online events were held in the Republic of Ireland and broadcast around the world.\nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition continued this year, albeit virtually. \nThe bowl was placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders discussed, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.\nThey might not have been in the same room but President Biden and the taoiseach were still able to virtually wish each other a Happy Saint Patrick's Day.\nIt was a day of a firsts - a first for Joe Biden as president who pledged his support for the Good Friday Agreement.\nReferring to the Good Friday Agreement he said: \"We strongly support y and think it is critically important that we maintain it. The political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples.\"\nAnd it was also Mr Martin's first St Patrick's Day as taoiseach.\nHe said he wanted to move forward with a \"positive relationship with the UK.\"\n\"That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. \n\"That in turn then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island - goals I know you support,\" he added.\nNorthern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers also held a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. \nA range of issues were covered during the meeting including progress on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery, as well as highlighting regional strengths and priorities.\nMichelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster Ministers also expressed hope that President Biden and Vice President Harris would visit Northern Ireland at some point in the future.\nHundreds of extra police officers were on duty in Northern Ireland for a \"robust\" response to St Patrick's Day rule breakers.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster had warned that St Patrick's Day \"must be different\" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Garda\u00ed (police) had a significant operation in place to deal with planned protests in Dublin city centre. \nSixteen people were arrested in the city for failing to comply with directions from garda to abide by Covid-19 regulations.\nThe Queen extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as 10 years ago.\"\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, with a record number of places taking part.\nSome 690 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nAlongside more famous landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Leaning Tower of Pisa were more quirky ones such as an abandoned sauna tilted on its side beside a lake in Finland, and a solar power-generated giraffe in Mozambique.\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River but the city's mayor decided to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nSt Patrick lived in the 5th Century and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nSt Patrick's Day started as a religious feast to celebrate his work, but it has grown to be an international festival of all things Irish."

      "tags": "US gun violence,Georgia,Asian Americans,Atlanta",
      "text": "A man has been charged with murder over the killing of eight people at massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia.\nOfficials cannot yet confirm if the attack, in which six Asian women were killed, was racially motivated. Four victims were named on Wednesday.\nThe suspect, named as Robert Aaron Long, faces multiple counts of murder as well as aggravated assault.\nCherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect may have been a patron and claimed to have a \"sex addiction\".\nThe attack comes amid a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans.\nFour of the victims have been identified by Cherokee County officials as Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R Hernandez-Ortiz was identified as having been injured.\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, investigators said Mr Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, admitted to the shooting spree, and said that he denied that the attack was motivated by race. \nHe has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department.\n\"He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,\" said Capt Jay Baker, adding that Mr Long was caught with a 9mm handgun and did not resist arrest. \nBut Capt Baker's remarks - that \"yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did\" - came in for widespread criticism for appearing to sympathise with the alleged perpetrator.\nMassage parlours are known to sometimes provide prostitution services, but authorities say there is no indication yet that this is the case at the targeted locations. \n\"These are legally operating businesses that have not been on our radar,\" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who added that the city would not engage in \"victim shaming, victim blaming\".\nPolice also noted it is still too early in the investigation to definitively state a motive and that the suspect appeared to have been acting alone.\nMs Bottoms said that he was on his way to Florida, possibly to commit more shootings, when he was arrested. \nThe suspect's parents helped to identify him, officials told reporters.\nAccording to CBS News, the suspect told investigators that \"he loved God and guns\". \nThe first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County.\nTwo people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded.\nLess than an hour later, police were called to a \"robbery in progress\" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. In the recording of the 911 call released on Wednesday, a woman tells the dispatcher that she's hiding from the assailant. \n\"Do you have a description of the male?\" the operator asks.\n\"We're hiding right now,\" the woman replies. \"They have a gun.\" \n\"Please come, ok?\" she says. \nWhen authorities arrived at the spa, \"officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds\", police said.\nWhile there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead.\nOn a second 911 call, a woman tells the operator that she got a call from a friend who said a man had entered the spa and fired a gun. \n\"They said some guy came in... We heard a gunshot and the lady's passed out in front of the door,\" she says. \"And everybody is scared and everybody is hiding.\" \nInvestigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta.\nAuthorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. \nPolice have only identified the people who were attacked in Cherokee County at this time.\nDetails have been slow to emerge. Here is what we know about the named victims so far.\nAshley Yaun and her husband had gone to Young's Asian Massage for a couples massage, according to an online fundraiser. \nHer husband survived the attack and was unharmed. The couple have two children.\n\"We just don't know how to do any of this alone,\" the GoFundMe page says.\nA GoFundMe for Mr Hernandez-Ortiz, the only victim to survive the attacks, says that he is intensive care after being shot in the forehead, lungs and stomach.\nHis daughter Yoseline, 9, told WGCL-TV that \"he is a really good dad,\" and \"I don't want him to go.\"\nBy Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Washington\nHeartbroken, fearful, angry, fed up. These are some shared feelings of people who showed up at a vigil in Washington DC the night after the shooting.\nAround 100 people marched in Chinatown and lit candles, mourning the eight lives lost in Atlanta - six of them of Asian descent. \nThe authorities have not linked the killing with anti-Asian hate crime. But many here believe the shooting is yet another senseless attack against Asians and Asian-Americans during the pandemic.\n\"It's scary to be an Asian-American woman anywhere in the US,\" an Asian woman told me. She said it was finally time for her to speak up, after being told by her parents to stay silent about racism she experienced while growing up. \nThere's a myth about Asian-Americans being the quiet \"model minority\". But those who attended the vigil, both Asians and non-Asians, spoke loud and clear with a unified voice.\n\"We will not fight racism with racism,\" a Korean-American man spoke to the crowd emotionally, \"We will fight racism with unity!\"\nThough authorities say it is too early to know if the victims were targeted because of their race, many online have criticised a recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, which activists have linked to rhetoric blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders acknowledged a motive was unclear, but said \"right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian American community that must be addressed\".\nIt called the shootings \"an unspeakable tragedy\" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has \"been reeling from high levels of racist attacks\".\n\"A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,\" Mayor Bottoms said in a statement, adding that she had been in communication with the White House.  \nMr Biden tweeted that he and the first lady were \"keeping everyone impacted by the shootings in Atlanta in our prayers\". \n\"We don't yet know the motive, but what we do know is that the Asian-American community is feeling enormous pain tonight. The recent attacks against the community are un-American.  They must stop,\" he said. \nVice-President Kamala Harris, the first Asian-American to hold the office, said during a Wednesday meeting with Irish officials: \"I do want to say to our Asian-American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people.\"\nBen Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: \"Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism.\"\nAtlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked.\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: \"Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \n \"Listen to the regulators\", Health Secretary Matt Hancock urges and tells people to \"get the jab\" as soon as they get the opportunity. He insists the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe after some European nations paused its use amid concern over blood clots. The UK's medicines watchdog, the MHRA, says evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots but some 13 countries have suspended use of the vaccine while they seek further clarification on its safety.\nA government scheme to house rough sleepers during the pandemic \"exposed the scale\" of the issue, say MPs. More than 37,000 people were taken off the streets by January 2021 as part of the Everyone In initiative, brought in due to Covid. This was praised by the Public Accounts Committee which said the number was nearly nine times official estimates of rough sleepers, showing a \"much larger\" issue than the government had \"acknowledged\". The government says it has \"ambitious plans\" to end rough sleeping.\nThe government's programme to help pupils who have missed school time catch up may not be reaching the most disadvantaged children, a report says. The National Tutoring Programme was launched last year to give extra tuition to the UK's poorest pupils and so far the Department for Education said it has invested \u00a32bn to help pupils. However, fewer than half of pupils who have already received tuition as part of the scheme are from the poorest families, a National Audit Office report found.\nWithdrawals from cash machines in the UK have fallen by \u00a337bn during the 12 months of the Covid pandemic, renewing the debate over the future of cash. Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, says the number of visits to ATMs has fallen by 43% compared with the previous 12 months. But the amount withdrawn on each cash machine visit has gone up, from an average of \u00a367 to \u00a384. Less demand and Covid restrictions mean 4,000 fewer free ATMs are in operation.\nDoctors and nurses in intensive care departments have shared their experiences throughout the pandemic, but what of the army of staff who have worked behind the scenes to keep hospitals running?

      "text": "A west Belfast grammar school has become the first to abandon academic selection for 2022.\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the governors of St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School said they would not take part in transfer tests this autumn.\nThe governors said this was due to the \"unprecedented mental and emotional stresses\" faced by Primary 6 children.\nSt Mary's is an all-boys grammar on Belfast's Glen Road.\nIt has more than 1,100 pupils and admits about 180 young people every year.\nIn previous years, it has used the transfer tests run by the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC) to select pupils.\nThe separate tests run by the PPTC and AQE were cancelled in 2021 due to disruption caused by the Covid pandemic.\nThat has meant the vast majority of more than 60 grammar schools are using non-academic criteria to select pupils for September 2021.\nSt Mary's has become the first grammar school to decide not to use transfer tests for a second year.\nFollowing a decision by the NI Executive on Tuesday, Primary 6 children are due to return to school on Monday, 22 March.\nHowever, those children have only been taught in school for about four months in the past year.\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the board of governors of St Mary's Grammar said the school had continued to offer its \"traditional high standard of teaching\" during the \"unforgiving pandemic\".\n\"For a significant number of years, the school has been oversubscribed and has utilised an academic selection criterion in allocating places available for its Year 8 intake,\" they continued.\n\"However, in the light of the current unprecedented mental and emotional stresses on both pupils and parents, the board of governors wish to focus on the health and well-being of the current Primary 6 cohort.\n\"Due to the current challenges faced by these young people, the board of governors have decided it will not take part in the PPTC transfer tests and will not use an academic selection criterion for 2022/23 school year.\"\nThe governors said the school would use other entrance criteria for 2022, which would be \"published in due course\".\nBBC News NI previously revealed that PPTC had asked schools to consider whether to use verbal reasoning tests to decide which pupils to admit in 2022.\nMore than 30 - mainly Catholic - grammars have been asked to consider what PPTC called a \"radical change\" to the tests this autumn, instead of tests in English and Maths.\nHowever, St Mary's has now decided to scrap academic selection for 2022 instead."

      "text": "A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the indecent assault and murder of Stuart Lubbock at the home of Michael Barrymore.\nMr Lubbock, 31, died in hospital after being found unconscious in the TV presenter's pool in Roydon, Essex.\nHe had been attending a party at the home of Mr Barrymore, 68, with eight other people in March 2001.\nThe man, who was arrested in Cheshire, has since been released on bail, Essex Police said.\nA post-mortem examination found Mr Lubbock had suffered \"horrific\" injuries prior to his death, police said. \nAlcohol, ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream.\nDet Supt Lucy Morris, Essex Police's head of major crime, said the arrest was made after \"significant new information\" came to light following a renewed appeal in February 2020. \n\"This information has led to us making an arrest and over the coming days we will be contacting all those who were present at the party at the time as well as others who may have information,\" she said. \n\"As we stated last February and have continually stated over the last 20 years, we believe someone or some people at that party know what happened.\"\nDet Supt Morris said the investigation had been \"extremely lengthy and complex\", adding: \"We have never given up on finding out what exactly happened to Stuart and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends.\"\nMr Lubbock, a butcher from Harlow, was described by neighbours at the time of his death as a \"pleasant, sociable\" man.\nNo-one has ever been charged with any offence in relation to his death. \nReacting to news of the arrest, Mr Lubbock's father Terry said: \"There is just so much going on in my head. I can't get my head around it. \n\"Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me.\"\nIn February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\"All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,\" he said.\nMr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge.\nThe TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death.\nSpeaking last year, he said: \"I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media.\"\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest.\nAn inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict. \nThree years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest.\nIn 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later.\nLast year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "St Patrick's Day \"must be different\" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues, First Minister Arlene Foster has warned.\nShe made the plea as she announced the first key changes to the restrictions.\nAll primary school pupils will return next Monday with all post-primary students set to return on 12 April.\nThere will also be changes to meeting up and some sports will be allowed to resume from 1 April.\nMrs Foster said decision-making capital was limited and needed to be \"spent wisely\".\n\"If we spend the capital on one easement of restrictions, it can't be spent on other things at the same time,\" she told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday.\nThe executive has regular review points every four weeks, with the next scheduled for 15 April.\nOutlining details of the executive's decisions, Mrs Foster said it was important restrictions were worked through in a \"careful and managed way\" at each review point.\n\"St Patrick's Day would normally be enjoyed by many. We need this to be different tomorrow,\" she said.\n\"Please continue to stay home. Do not socialise outside your family or your bubble, and we particularly want to say to young people that you need to follow the rules and the advice.\"\nShe said the decision to prioritise education was important for children to \"build and grow their friendship networks, to be able to socialise and grow their own interests and future potential\".\n\"The weather is improving and we have been in this current lockdown for around 80 days,\" added the first minister.\n\"That is a long time and a big ask, and we have been so grateful to everyone who has made a personal contribution to the improvement in the Covid situation.   \nMrs Foster acknowledged some people would be disappointed their sectors had not yet been given dates to reopen.\n\"We have focused on outdoor settings where the risk is relatively lower than indoor settings,\" she added.\nThe Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey also appealed for a quiet day. \nOn Tuesday she met representatives of Belfast City Council, local elected representatives, the PSNI, and Ulster and Queen's Universities, to discuss plans in place to prevent large gatherings in the Holylands area of Belfast.\n\"This year it is more important than ever that those who live in the Holylands and surrounding areas adhere to public health guidelines.  \n\"Breaches of those guidelines are completely unacceptable,\" she said.\nThe executive has also agreed to increase the provision for elite sports from March 25 March to allow a number of new competitions to begin.\nMrs Foster said the \"minor adjustment\" to the restrictions would allow two World Cup qualification matches scheduled for 25 and 31 March to take place as well as a friendly match between NI and the USA on 28 March. \nNo spectators will be permitted at any sporting event. \nStormont's health minister said it was vitally important that a \"free-for-all\" situation was avoided as restrictions eased.\nIn a paper for the Stormont Executive, Robin Swann said he continued to recommend a gradual approach.\nThere pandemic had resulted in \"increased harmful alcohol consumption, more snacking and increased sedentary behaviour\", he added.\nCommenting on the reopening of schools Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Children and Young People said she was \"pleased with a tinge of frustration\" about the move.\nKoulla Yiasouma told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that many primary school staff had been preparing for further remote learning, in the absence of clarity from the executive.\nDr Tom Black, chair of BMA Northern Ireland Council, said it was \"extremely important\" for children to return to school for their educational and social development as well as their mental health.\nHe said it was also very important that any easing of restrictions was done in a safe way.\nSport NI welcomed what it called \"the first cautious steps towards a return to outdoor sport\".\nUlster GAA said the organisation's Covid advisory group will issue updated guidance following news that groups of up to 15 people will be able to train together from 12 April.\nIt said clubs in Northern Ireland must stress to players and management teams that \"12 April is the earliest date that they may be permitted to resume activity\".\nReacting to the news about click and collect services Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was a \"much-needed lifeline to those struggling independent retailers\".\nThe chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, also called for indicative dates and clarity. \n\"At the very least, the data behind reopening decisions should be published,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, one death was reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 2,100.\nA further 164 cases of the virus were also confirmed.\nThere are 176 inpatients currently being treated for coronavirus in Northern Ireland, with 18 in intensive care.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Department of Health has reported 18 further Covid-related deaths and 349 new cases. Seventeen deaths occurred in March and one in February.\nIt brings the total number of deaths in the Republic of Ireland to 4,552 and the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases stands at 227,663.\nIn Northern Ireland, tough coronavirus restrictions were initially imposed on 26 December, in a bid to curb a rise in cases of Covid-19.\nThere have been some adjustments to the rules but households are generally still not allowed to mix indoors, pubs, cafes and restaurants remain closed except for takeaway, and most shops are shut.\nIn Northern Ireland, P1 to P3 pupils returned to the classroom last Monday, as did nursery and pre-school children.\nLast week, the executive ditched a previous plan for those pupils to go back to remote learning on 22 March when some secondary schoolchildren, year groups 12 to 14, are due to return to school.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir had been pushing for all remaining pupils to return as soon as possible and two weeks notice would have been preferable.\n\"My preference would have been that earlier decisions were taken,\" he said.\n\"That has to be weighed up against the wider public health situation and also a desire from the executive as a whole to try to take this in the context of a strategic decision in relation to that.\"\nMr Weir said it was important to get children back to school as soon as possible.\nVulnerable children and children of key workers have had access to schools for supervised learning since January, and special schools remained open as usual.\nSchools in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have all reopened on a wider basis."

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to have authorised attempts to influence last year's US election in favour of former President Donald Trump, intelligence officials say.\nMoscow spread \"misleading or unsubstantiated allegations\" about the eventual winner, Joe Biden, according to a US government report.\nBut it said no foreign government had compromised the final results.\nRussia called the allegations of election interference \"baseless\".\n\"The conclusions of the report... are confirmed solely by the confidence of the intelligence services of their self-righteousness,\" the Russian embassy in Washington said in a statement. \"No facts or specific evidence of such claims were provided.\"\nThe US is expected to impose sanctions on Russia as soon as next week over the report's conclusions, three sources told Reuters news agency.\nThe 15-page report, released on Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, outlined what it said were \"influence operations\" pushed by Russia as well as Iran.\nIt said Russian-linked individuals had spread unsubstantiated claims about President Biden ahead of the 3 November election. It also said a disinformation campaign sought to undermine confidence in the broader election process.\nSome people connected to Russian intelligence also pushed anti-Biden narratives to media outlets, senior officials and allies of Mr Trump, the report said.\nPresident Biden defeated Mr Trump and was inaugurated on 20 January.\nThe report added that, while Russia had sought to boost Mr Trump's chances of victory, Iran had launched a \"multi-pronged covert influence campaign\" in an effort to weaken his support.\nThe former president pursued a policy of \"maximum pressure\" on Iran, imposing damaging sanctions and escalating a war of words between the two nations.\nThe report also concluded with \"high confidence\" that China, which has long been accused of cyber-espionage by Washington, chose not to \"deploy interference efforts\" ahead of the vote.\n\"China sought stability in its relationship with the United States and did not view either election outcome as being advantageous enough for China to risk blowback if caught,\" it said.\nAccording to the report, the voting process and final results were not interfered with by foreign states.\nThe intelligence report was released at the same time as a joint investigation by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security which came to a similar conclusion. \nTheir report said \"broad Russian and Iranian campaigns targeting multiple critical infrastructure sectors did compromise the security of several networks that managed some election functions\".\nBut it emphasised that the alleged interference attempts were largely indirect.\n\"We have no indications that any foreign actor attempted to interfere... by altering any technical aspect of the voting process, including voter registration, ballot casting, vote tabulation, or reporting results,\" the document reads.\nThe US intelligence community said last August that China, Russia and Iran were actively trying to meddle in the forthcoming presidential election.\nThe assessment found that Russia was seeking to \"denigrate\" Mr Biden. It also found that China and Iran wanted Mr Trump to lose the vote.\nAnalysis by Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nUS intelligence officials accuse Russia of making \"unsubstantiated allegations\" about Mr Biden, but research shows the dominant drivers of misinformation about the election were closer to home. \nMr Trump and his supporters consistently promoted unfounded claims about widespread voter fraud on social media before, during and after the election.\nMany accused Mr Trump of deliberately trying to undermine faith in the election process - the same allegation now being levelled at Russia.\nHow much do the American intelligence agencies think the Russian operation boosted the former president's effort? The declassified report, scant on detail, doesn't really say.\nIf the goal of the alleged influence campaigns was to sway the vote in Mr Trump's favour, it clearly failed.\nBut operations that seek to create confusion and stoke division are a tool that countries will continue to use - and not only during elections. \nThe Washington riots on 6 January, though not driven by a foreign power, provided a powerful example of how misinformation spread online can threaten democracy and result in real-world violence."

      "text": "Withdrawals from cash machines in the UK have fallen by \u00a337bn during the 12 months of the Covid pandemic, renewing the debate over the future of cash.\nLink, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, said the number of visits to ATMs had fallen by 43% compared with the previous 12 months.\nBut the amount withdrawn on each cash machine visit has gone up, from an average of \u00a367 to \u00a384.\nLess demand and Covid restrictions mean 4,000 fewer free ATMs are in operation.\nSome may be restored, such those at a busy supermarket which may have temporarily cordoned off for social distancing, but other cost pressures will still exist for providers.\nIt still remains likely that further cuts to the 41,000 free-to-use machines will come in the next few years, prompting concern that some vulnerable people will be unable to access their favoured way to pay.\nThe first national lockdown starting in March 2020 led to a massive cut in cash machine use, according to the Link data.\nATM visits were down by 80% in some areas. \nThis recovered to a degree when restrictions were eased, and particularly when some hospitality venues such as pubs reopened.\nHowever, there is little doubt that shops, consumers, and venues have become more accustomed to taking cards rather than cash.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the Budget that the limit on a single contactless card payment would rise from \u00a345 to \u00a3100 later this year.\nThis was met with a mixed response, ranging from those celebrating the added convenience to warnings about theft and fraud.\nNatalie Ceeney, who chaired an independent review on access to cash, recently said that cash refusal by retailers was \"creeping into the UK economy\".\nShe said that much would depend on whether old habits will return to places such as pubs and hairdressers, which have traditionally seen high cash use.\n\"It is crucial to understand that cash remains vital for millions of people. Not everyone has a bank account and not everyone can use digital,\" she said. \n\"Cash allows you to budget to the last penny. Fewer ATMs, bank branch closures and shops going cashless may be seen as progress to some, but there are still a lot of people out there where it makes life more difficult, expensive and uncertain.\""

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,David Davis",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has said she \"strongly refutes\" allegations by a Conservative MP about her government's handling of complaints against Alex Salmond.\nFormer Brexit secretary David Davis used parliamentary privilege to claim there was a concerted effort in the SNP to encourage women to make complaints.\nThe first minister rejected this as \"the latest instalment in Alex Salmond's conspiracy theory\".\nShe said she would leave the Holyrood inquiry to consider the evidence.\nMs Sturgeon was repeatedly asked about the row at her Covid-19 briefing, but said she did not want the briefing to be \"sidetracked\" from health matters.\nThe intervention from Mr Davis at Westminster on Tuesday was the latest development in a long-running dispute between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond, her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader.\nMr Salmond took the Scottish government to court in 2018 over its investigation into two internal harassment complaints against him, with the government ultimately conceding ahead of a judicial review that the way it conducted the probe was \"unlawful\".\nHe was later charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, but was cleared of all of the allegations against him after a High Court trial in March 2020.\nIn his evidence to the Holyrood inquiry that was set up to examine what went wrong with the government investigation, Mr Salmond said there had been a \"malicious scheme\" among senior SNP figures to damage his reputation in the wake of the judicial review case.\nMr Davis, who is a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond, told the House of Commons on Tuesday evening that he had been passed evidence by a whistleblower, in the form of messages from a senior SNP official.\nHe read some messages out in the Commons and said they \"show that there is a concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" after the criminal investigation into Mr Salmond had started.\nAsked about this on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon said she was \"not able to add anything\" to the evidence she gave in a lengthy session in front of the inquiry earlier this month.\nShe said: \"Other than to say I refute - strongly refute - the suggestions and insinuations from David Davis in the House of Commons last night, I am not going to have this Covid briefing sidetracked by the latest instalment of Alex Salmond's conspiracy theory.\n\"I have given eight hours of evidence to the parliamentary committee looking in to this. \n\"They are able to assess the evidence - they have a job of work to do and I am going to allow them to do that while I get on with my job, of leading this Covid briefing.\"\nMr Davis also told MPs that he had it \"on good authority\" that there were messages between civil servants \"suggesting that the first minister's chief of staff is interfering in the complaints process against Alex Salmond\".\nHe said this showed the chief of staff - Liz Lloyd - had been aware of complaints as early as February 2018, whereas Ms Sturgeon has insisted she only learned of them that April.\nWhen asked whether she still had full confidence in her chief of staff, Ms Sturgeon replied: \"Yes.\"\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a statement on behalf of one of the nine complainers from Mr Salmond's criminal trial was published by Rape Crisis Scotland.\nThe woman said that she had been approached by Scottish government HR about an investigation into Mr Salmond's behaviour in January 2018, and had spoken to Ms Lloyd \"to gain advice and an understanding of my obligations\".\nShe said Ms Lloyd had offered to convey her thoughts to senior civil servants, and that \"this was not 'interfering', but acting in line with my wishes\".\nDavid Davis told the Commons an unnamed whistleblower supplied the information he released using the special freedom of speech privileges MPs have.\nThat a former Conservative minister should do this in apparent sympathy with a former SNP leader and first minister is not as surprising as it might first appear.\nDespite their political disagreements, Alex Salmond and David Davis are old friends with Mr Davis appearing as a star guest in Mr Salmond's show at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2017.\nMany of the messages between senior SNP officials discussing the criminal case against Alex Salmond have already been released to the Holyrood committee of inquiry for consideration.\nThe BBC understands the document alleging interference by the first minister's chief of staff in the earlier Scottish government investigation of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond has now been passed to the committee by the Crown Office, which handles prosecutions in Scotland.\nMSPs on that committee are currently preparing their report into this saga which is expected to be published next week, just before Holyrood breaks for the election. \nIn her evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said claims of a plot against Mr Salmond were \"absurd\".\nShe said her government had made a \"very serious error\" in its internal investigation process, but said it had nothing to hide and no reason to want to \"get\" Mr Salmond.\nFollowing Mr Davis's speech, a spokesman for the first minister said that \"as with Mr Salmond's previous claims and cherry picking of messages, the reality is very different to the picture being presented\".\nHe added: \"Every message involving SNP staff has been seen by the committee previously. Their views have been widely reported as dismissive of them.\"\nThe first of a number of expected reports about the row was published on Tuesday, in the form of an independent review of the government's recently-devised complaints handling process.\nLaura Dunlop QC recommended that investigations of harassment complaints against former ministers like Mr Salmond should be independent of government, saying that \"the risks of perception of bias, either in favour of or against the person complained about, are obvious\".\nThe report of the Holyrood inquiry committee and another into whether or not Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code in her dealings with Mr Salmond are expected to be published in the coming week."

      "text": "The government's programme to help pupils who have missed school time catch up may not be reaching the most disadvantaged children, a report says.\nThe National Tutoring Programme was launched last year to give extra tuition to the UK's poorest pupils.\nBut fewer than half of pupils who have already received tuition as part of the scheme are from the poorest families, a National Audit Office report found.\nThe Department for Education says it has invested \u00a32bn to help pupils.\nChair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, said the Department for Education's \"failure to do its homework\" had hit children who were already most disadvantaged.\nThe Labour MP said: \"DfE must now ensure its support is properly targeted to prevent the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers from widening even further.\"\nIn June last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a \u00a31bn catch-up fund to help pupils in England.\nThe package included \u00a3350m for the National Tutoring Programme to help the most disadvantaged pupils, as well as \u00a3650m for schools to help children from all backgrounds catch up.\nAlthough the tuition scheme is aimed at disadvantaged children, the Dfe has not specified what proportion of children accessing it should be disadvantaged. \nThe report found that of the 125,200 children who had been allocated a tutoring place by February, 41,100 had started to receive tuition. Of those, 44% were eligible for pupil premium funding - a grant given to schools in England to help disadvantaged children.\nThat raised \"questions over the extent to which the scheme will reach the most disadvantaged children\", the report said.\nAcademic mentors are also being placed in schools serving poorer communities to help provide intensive catch-up support. But demand had \"outstripped supply\", the report added. \nMentors had been placed in 1,100 schools by February, but it had received requests from 1,789 eligible schools - meaning more than 600 had not received one.\nThe report says the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic had been an \"unprecedented challenge\" for the DfE. \nBut it says aspects of its response could have been better and done more quickly. The DfE had no pre-existing plan for managing mass disruption to schooling, it added.\nIn April last year, the DfE considered providing 602,000 laptops or tablets and 100,000 4G routers to ensure vulnerable children and those in priority year groups had access to digital devices.\nBut due to the practical difficulty of supplying so many devices, it decided to instead focus on children with a social worker and care leavers, alongside disadvantaged pupils in Year 10 - a total of 220,000 laptops and tablets, and 50,000 routers.\nThe report said \"substantial amounts of equipment did not reach local authorities and academy trusts until June\", meaning many children may not have been able to access remote learning until well into the second half of the summer term.\nGareth Davies, head of the NAO, said it was \"crucial that the department monitors the impact of its catch-up arrangements, particularly on disadvantaged children, and acts on the results\".\nAnd Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government had \"been the cause of a great deal of unnecessary confusion and upset\" and had \"prioritised good press over good practice\". \nCllr Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said it was \"vital that catch-up support is strictly targeted to avoid any further widening of education gaps between disadvantaged pupils and their peers\".\nA DfE spokesperson said it had \"acted swiftly at every turn to help minimise the impact on pupils' education and provide extensive support for schools, colleges and early years settings\".\n\"We have invested over \u00a32bn into schemes to provide pupils with devices for remote education and ambitious catch-up plans - with funding targeted at disadvantaged children and young people who need support the most.\"  "

Its head, Emer Cooke, pointed out that blood clots highlighted by some countries were relatively common in the general population. \n\"I want to stress at present there is no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions,\" she said.\nIn a joint statement later on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the EMA's comments were \"encouraging\".\nMeanwhile, experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) were also meeting on Tuesday but a spokesman stressed there was \"no evidence\" that the reported blood clots were linked to the vaccine. \nThe WHO has urged countries not to pause their vaccinations. The suspensions come as much of Europe struggles to control rising cases.\nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring.\nSome 13 European countries have paused their use of the vaccine. Denmark was first, followed by Norway and Iceland. Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Spain, Latvia and Sweden are the latest to follow suit.\nOn Monday, the three largest EU members - Germany, France and Italy - said they were awaiting the results of the EMA investigation before deciding whether to resume their rollout of the jab.\nThey said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\"We expect some kind of verdict from the European scientific community by Thursday afternoon, allowing us to resume the campaign,\" French Health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said on Tuesday.\n\"There were a few very unusual and troubling cases which justify this pause and the analysis,\" French immunologist Alain Fischer, who heads a government advisory board, told France Inter radio. \"It's not lost time.\"\nIn Germany, the health ministry also pointed to a small number of rare blood clots in vaccinated people when justifying its decision. It has postponed a summit on extending the vaccine rollout ahead of the EMA's expected announcement on Thursday.\nThere is as yet no evidence that the specified clots were linked to the vaccine, and the EMA has said other factors are likely behind the incidents.\nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the AstraZeneca drug, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer the vaccine.\nThe decision to halt rollouts of the AstraZeneca vaccine has been criticised by some politicians and doctors. \nKarl Lauterbach, a German epidemiologist and health spokesman for the centre-left Social Democrats, said while the pause was justifiable, it was also political. \n\"I would even now get vaccinated with the AstraZeneca. Based on the incidents we now know, the benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the risks, particularly for the elderly,\" he told Deutschlandfunk radio. \nA spokeswoman for Germany's opposition Free Democrats said the decision had set back the country's entire vaccination rollout. German Greens health expert Janosch Dahmen, meanwhile, argued that authorities could have continued using the drug. \nAnd Poland's vaccination head Michal Dworczyk said countries that have paused their use of the drug \"have succumbed to the panic caused by media coverage of alleged complications\".\nThe intense divisions over the AstraZeneca jab come as much of the continent is struggling to contain a surge in coronavirus cases. \nThe rise has led many countries to tighten restrictions, and there are concerns over the pace of Europe's vaccination drive which has already been affected by supply shortages. \nGerman infections are growing \"exponentially\", with cases up by 20% in the past week, an expert from the RKI public health agency warned on Tuesday.\nWhile in France, Prime Minister Jean Castex said the widespread prevalence of three Covid-19 variants meant the country was now in \"a sort of third wave\".\n\"The outbreak is going into extra time,\" he told parliament on Tuesday.\nNorway's capital, Oslo, has announced tougher restrictions, while Italy and the Netherlands are both enforcing lockdowns.\nSome 575,000 people in the European Union have died as a result of coronavirus, and the pandemic has taken a major economic toll."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Arlene Foster has said she knows people want Covid restrictions eased faster, but the last thing she wants is to have to \"step backwards\" again.\nThe first minister was speaking after the executive announced the first key changes to the restrictions on Tuesday.\nBusiness groups have criticised the lack of dates provided for when they will be able to reopen.\nIt comes as Northern Ireland's four main churches will return to public worship in time for Easter.\nThe Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April.\nThe Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a \"cautious\" return a week earlier, from 26 March.\nMeanwhile, the Health Minister Robin Swann on Wednesday addressed a reduction in vaccine supplies announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\nMr Swann tweeted that \"we are currently considering what impact if any\" the announcement would have on vaccination plans in Northern Ireland.\n\"Our vaccination programme will continue in the coming weeks and more people will continue to receive first and second doses,\" he said.\n\"As has been the case since the programme began, the number of vaccinations carried out over time will vary due to supply however our programme is presently ahead of schedule and as ever we will be able to adapt to any changes in circumstances as they arise.\"\nEarlier, on Good Morning Ulster, Mrs Foster said it was vital that coronavirus was kept under control in Northern Ireland and that restrictions have to be lifted \"in a slow way\". \n\"We are in a five-party executive; from my perspective we would like to move in a more steady way, others are more cautious.\n\"However I do think it is very important that we do need to protect all of our services in our healthcare - and the best way to protect all of our services and our healthcare system is to make sure that we don't see another rise in Covid cases.\"\nMrs Foster added: \"I know that there is a great desire to open up in a faster fashion. Our taskforce in the executive will not just look at the health data, which of course is important, but the economic and societal data as well\n\"We're doing that on a rolling basis.\n\"Last year, when we had that flexibility built into our plan, it allowed us to move a little faster that some other jurisdictions and my hope and desire is that that will be the case in this case as well.\"\nNorthern Ireland has been in lockdown since 26 December.\nMeasures announced on Tuesday to ease the lockdown include the return of all primary school children to school from Monday, other school groups from 12 April and more people allowed to meet outdoors from 1 April.\nGarden centres can resume click-and-collect services from 1 April and other non-essential shops from 12 April.\nRetail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" that the executive had given \"no dates, no timeframes, no nothing\" for businesses to reopen.\n\"It is exceptionally frustrating when we are putting forward ideas on how we can make our high streets safe, cut down transmission levels of the virus and reassure consumers, but nothing is being done,\" Mr Roberts said.\n\"If we don't get some indication of when our economy is allowed to reopen, then we're going to off-the-scale unemployment, business failure, huge off-the-scale levels of mental health problems in our society.\"\nDawn McLaughlin, chief executive of Derry Chamber, said some business felt like they are no further forward. \n\"What we would ask the executive is to provide a bit of hope to our members and to businesses throughout NI, give them some clarity in terms of indicative dates, not necessarily actual dates, but at least give them time to plan, time to organise,\" she said.\n\"A bit of clarity, a bit of time - we all understand if the numbers go the wrong way it'll have to be postponed, but give them that hope and that clarity.\"\nWilliam Montgomery, who runs a garden centre in County Armagh, said the return of click and collect was a small but welcome step.\n\"Realistically we're probably only going to be looking at 10%-15% of sales probably that we would normally do at this time of year,\" he said.\n\"But it will get us through, it will get rid of some stock that we have there that currently we can't sell.\"\nNo new Covid-19 related deaths were reported in NI on Wednesday. \nThe Department of Health said there had been 161 new coronavirus cases within the last 24 hours.\nIn the Republic of Ireland the Irish Department of Health announced 17 more deaths related to Covid-19 on Wednesday. \nNine of those deaths occurred in March, four in February, and four occurred in January or earlier bringing the total to 4,566 deaths overall.\nThere were 557 more confirmed cases bringing the total number to 228,215 to date."

      "text": "Eight people, many of them women of Asian descent, have been killed in shootings at spas in the US state of Georgia.\nPolice say the shootings took place at a massage parlour in Acworth, a suburb north of Atlanta, and two spas in the city itself.\nSouth Korea later confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent.\nOfficials say a 21-year-old man was arrested and is suspected of involvement in all of the attacks.\nNo motive has yet been established, but there are fears the crimes may have deliberately targeted people of Asian descent. \nHate crimes against Asian-Americans spiked in recent months, fuelled by rhetoric that blames them for the spread of Covid-19.\nIn an address last week, President Joe Biden condemned \"vicious hate crimes against Asian-Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.\"\nThe first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County.\nTwo people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Jay Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded.\nLess than an hour later, police were called to a \"robbery in progress\" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. \n\"Upon arrival, officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds,\" police said.\nWhile there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead.\nPolice quoted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said all four Atlanta victims were Asian women.\nInvestigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta.\nCapt Baker said investigators were \"very confident\" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. \nThe identities of the victims have not yet been made public. Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. \nAuthorities say it is too early in the investigation to know if the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity.\nThe advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, said it was not clear \"whether or not the shootings were related or motivated by hate. But right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian-American community that must be addressed\".\nIt called the shootings \"an unspeakable tragedy\" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has \"been reeling from high levels of racist attacks\".\n\"A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,\" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that she had been in communication with the White House.  \nBen Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: \"Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism.\"\nAtlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked.\nThe New York Police Department's counter-terrorism branch said that while there was no known connection to New York city, it would \"be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the city out of an abundance of caution\".\nThe police department in Seattle also said it would increase patrols and outreach to support its Asian-American community. \nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: \"Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence.\"\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. \"We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,\" he said. \n\"We will stand up for the right of our fellow Americans, Korean Americans, to be safe, to be treated with dignity.\"\nThe White House said Mr Biden had been briefed on the \"horrific\" shootings. \nData compiled by the Pew Research Center"

      "tags": "Spain,France,Greece,Travel,Ursula von der Leyen,Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A digital certificate to kick-start foreign travel should be given to citizens across the EU \"without discrimination\", officials say.\nThe aim is to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU.\nThe 27 member states will decide how to use the new digital certificate.\nVaccine passports have faced opposition from some EU member states over concerns they might be discriminatory.\nSome argue that they would enable a minority to enjoy foreign travel without restrictions while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face measures such as quarantine. European Commission officials have made clear they want to avoid discrimination.\nAnother issue raised has been that data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete.\nAhead of the EU's announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was working to \"create an international trusted framework\" for safe travel, but that vaccinations should not be a condition. \nSeparately, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has threatened to withhold exporting vaccines to the UK and any other countries outside the EU that do not supply doses in a reciprocal way. \n\"We're still waiting for doses to come from the UK,\" she said. \"So, this is an invitation to show us that there are also doses from the UK coming to the European Union.\" \nSpeaking in Brussels on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed digital green certificate would be \"for all EU citizens, their families when they're leaving the EU or living abroad\". \n\"It'll also be for the European Economic Area (EEA), because we want to work with Norway and Iceland,\" he said, adding that Switzerland would also be involved. \nMr Reynders said there was still a lot to do to put the digital certificate in place, but the aim was to get it up and running before the summer tourist season. \nThe European Commission proposal sets out that any EU member state permitting vaccinated travellers to bypass restrictions such as quarantine must accept certificates from other states within the bloc under the same conditions. \nThe vaccines should be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These currently include drugs developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, but not Russia's Sputnik V or China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. \nHowever, the proposal adds that the guidelines \"should not prevent member states from deciding to accept vaccination certificates issued for other Covid-19 vaccines\".\nMeanwhile, in the UK, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was looking at the idea of vaccine passports and had been \"discussing what the best way to proceed is\".\n\"We are having debates, discussions about travel... but I think what we also have to do is be driven by the data, we've got to see how coronavirus develops,\" he told the BBC.\nMore than a third of the UK population - nearly 25 million people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine in the UK, which is no longer a member of the European Union.\nThe rollout across the EU has been slower, and has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the current suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over fears of possible side effects. \nThe economies of countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy are unlikely to recover until the tourist industry is reopened, and they have been looking at ways to save the summer season while providing a safe environment for both travellers and local residents. \nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Wednesday welcomed the planned certificate, which he said would \"significantly facilitate the movement of citizens and will help boost tourism and the economies that rely heavily on it\".\nLast month, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos said that a common digital certificate was \"not discriminatory\", and that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer - but the procedure for them would be slower as they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival.\nA hotel manager in the Spanish resort of Benidorm, Ricardo S\u00e1nchez, told the BBC that the UK was its most important market, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, and people arriving from Eastern Europe. \n\"So many months working with so many restrictions and the restrictions are changing every 15 days,\" he said, adding that would-be tourists were unsure what to do and were waiting for \"good news\" before booking reservations. \nIceland has said it is opening its borders to visitors who have received the vaccine without the need for testing or quarantine later this week.

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,Nuclear weapons",
      "text": "The UK is set to reverse plans to reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by the middle of the decade, as part of a foreign policy overhaul. \nThe overall cap on the number of warheads will now increase to 260, having been due to drop to 180 under previous plans from 2010.\nThe UK will shift focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, described as the world's \"growth engine\".\nAnd it pledges the UK will do more on the \"systemic challenge\" of China.\nOutlining the strategy to MPs, Boris Johnson said the UK would have to \"relearn the art\" of competing against countries with \"opposing values\".\nBut he added the UK would remain \"unswervingly committed\" to the Nato defence alliance and preserving peace and security in Europe.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an \"era of retreat,\" with armed forces cuts \"every year for the last decade\".\nThe integrated review of foreign and defence policies, which runs to over 100 pages, has taken over a year and sets out UK priorities until 2030.\nThe UK nuclear stockpile is estimated to comprise 195 warheads, and had been due to fall to 180 by the mid-2020s under a 2010 defence review.\nBut the latest assessment says this ambition is \"no longer possible\" given the \"evolving security environment\" over the last decade. \nIt adds that the UK will no longer publish figures on the size of its operational stockpile, to maintain \"deliberate ambiguity\" for adversaries. \nHowever, it pledges the UK will maintain the \"minimum destructive power needed to guarantee that the UK's nuclear deterrent remains credible\".\nThe review, which identifies Russia as the \"most acute threat\" to UK security, also says:\nThe review also pledged to reverse cuts on foreign aid, from 0.7% of national income down to 0.5%, when \"the fiscal situation allows\".\nThe government has previously faced criticism for the cuts, which it said were necessary in the wake of financial challenges posed by the Covid pandemic.\nThe review argues the UK should refocus its foreign policy towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia in the \"Indo-Pacific\" region.\nIt said the region's shipping lanes were vital to maintain UK trade with Asia, whilst the region is also on the \"frontline of new security challenges\".\nAnalysis by Rob Watson, BBC World Service UK Political Correspondent\nWhat's striking about the review is the continuity in UK foreign policy.  \nSo just as before Brexit and \"Global Britain\", the UK continues to see the main threats to its security as China, Russia, terrorism and cyber attacks.  And it continues to have as its main goals, among other things, the promotion of democracy, free trade, human rights and the fight against climate change. \nThere are differences, though. The most striking is the suggestion of a pivot away from Europe to the Indo-Pacific.\nBut exactly what that means is not spelled out (although we do know Boris Johnson will travel to India next month, and there will be new focus on new partnerships and trade agreements with south-east Asian countries).\nMore broadly, Mr Johnson's central claim is that leaving the EU will make the UK more nimble and flexible, whether it's in how to deal with China or becoming a science superpower or anything else.  \nCritics will say the review is long on aspiration and that the UK will face the same global challenges it faced before Brexit - but with one fewer foreign policy tool in its toolbox, namely its membership of the EU.  \nMr Johnson said: \"The review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values.\"\nHe said the UK had led international condemnation of China's \"mass detention\" of Uighur people in Xinjiang, and its actions in Hong Kong, adding: \"There is no question China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours.\"\nIn response, Sir Keir said UK policy towards China had been \"inconsistent\" and the government had \"turned a blind eye\" to the country's human rights abuses.\nHe said Labour remained committed to retaining nuclear weapons, but said the document had failed to detail the \"strategic purpose\" for increasing the warhead stockpile.\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the review demonstrated \"just how hollow the brand of Global Britain is\".\nHe also asked the prime minister \"who gave his government the democratic right to renege on the UK's obligations under the nuclear proliferation treaty\" referring to the government's plans on nuclear weapons.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Beatrice Fihn - head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons -  described the UK's decision to change its nuclear provision as \"outrageous, irresponsible and very dangerous\".\nShe said it went against international law and didn't address the real security threats faced by Britain such as climate change and disinformation. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent \nThe review calls China the \"biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security\".\nBut there is clearly disquiet among the government's own MPs that it hasn't been robust enough in identifying the challenge posed by its Communist regime.  \nFormer Conservative foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was worried by its description of China as a \"systemic\" challenge, given its current clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. \nAnother senior Conservative, Julian Lewis, took issue with its description of China as a \"partner\".\nHe added it suggested the \"grasping naivety\" of the party's approach under David Cameron and George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, \"still lingers on\".\nBoris Johnson said there was a \"balance to be struck\", and although the UK wanted a \"strong trading relationship,\" it should be \"clear-eyed\" and \"tough where we see risk\".\nBut the trade-offs between seeking investment and protecting the UK from becoming too vulnerable to Chinese economic and political influence and pressure will come under increasing scrutiny.

He just tried to get into a ball and protect himself as best he could.\"\nMartin is aware of some of the details of the attack because his brother managed to ring him in the minutes afterwards. \nHowever, Martin was not fully aware of the critical nature of Glenn's injuries. \n\"He was quite lucid and by no means did I think that Glenn had been assaulted as badly as he had been. \n\"The next was Glenn couldn't be contacted and that's when Glenn's body was found.\n\"I still blame myself that I didn't act, didn't phone an ambulance.\n\"I wish I'd spoke longer to him, I wish I'd have said so many other things and if I had knew this was the last conversation I was going to have with Glenn. Tell him how much I loved him... talk about old times, and I didn't have that opportunity.\"\nThe Ulster Defence Association, formed in 1971, had tens of thousands of members at its peak.\nIt killed hundreds of people during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and often claimed responsibility for sectarian murders using the cover name the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF).\nThe UDA had remained a legal organisation until it was banned in August 1992.\nNotorious attacks by the UFF included the shooting dead of five Catholics at a Belfast bookmakers in 1992 and the Greysteel massacre the following year.\nRead more here: Loyalist paramilitary groups 'have 12,500 members'\nGlenn Quinn was beaten to death for passing a remark about the South East Antrim UDA.  \nWhen his family appealed for help with the PSNI investigation, they were also threatened by the South East Antrim UDA.  \n\"I personally have been threatened three times, my mother's been threatened... They're threatening to shoot a 76-year-old woman. \n\"And that's part and parcel of how this organisation operate, they try to put people in fear.\"\nGlenn Quinn's death shocked Carrickfergus and beyond, but many locals remain too scared to speak out. \nThe murder, they say, is what happens when a ruthless criminal gang is effectively out-of-control and perceives itself to be above the law.  \n\"I want people to search their hearts,\" said Martin.\n\"Because, next time, and there will be a next time, it might be their brother, it might be their son, and I'd ask them to do something to stop this. \n\"To break the silence. And help us.\"\nWatch the full Spotlight story on iPlayer. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted.\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\nThat date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that \"brighter days are ahead of us\".\nThe \"stay at home\" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to \"stay local\" for a further three weeks.\nOther changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April.\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that:\nA decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept \"under ongoing review\".\nShe told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest.\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\".\nHowever, she said she was \"optimistic\" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues.\n\"This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,\" she said.\nRestrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or \"as soon as possible thereafter\".\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus.\nShe said that \"our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that\" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place \"for some time to come\".\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome.\nHowever, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments.\nAnd she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can \"get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear\".\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed \"effective testing and tracing\" systems to keep infections low.\nHe called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that \"transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close\".\nData not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland.\nThe first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored.\nWhen Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic.\nToday, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme.\nBut the first minister said this was the \"most hopeful\" she had felt for a long time and that \"something much closer to actual normality\" might be achieved as we move into summer.\nThe change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown.\nMs Sturgeon said the government had to make \"careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions\" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving \"steadily and in one direction\".\nThe final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the \"need for medium term-support\". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year.\nScottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was \"most welcome for everyone\", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission\", and that \"we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can\".\nScottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the \"indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area\".\nThe first minister said everything was \"predicated on the data going in the right direction\", and that \"all bets are off\" if case numbers rise sharply again.\nShe told MSPs that her \"hope and ambition\" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month."

      "text": "Prolific burglars, robbers and thieves are to be tagged with GPS trackers in a bid to stop them reoffending.\nOffenders will be automatically tagged for up to 12 months after being released from prison, under a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pilot.\nGwent, Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Humberside and West Midlands police forces are all taking part.\nThe MoJ said tracking offenders 24 hours a day would act as a deterrent.\nIt estimated 250 offenders, who have served a year in prison, will be fitted with the tag in the first six months of the scheme, as part of their licence conditions.\nPolice will be able to cross-reference the GPS data with reports of new thefts, robberies and burglaries to see if offenders were in the area at the time.\nBurglars broke into Diane Titmus's hair salon, stealing about \u00a32,000 of stock and all of her stylists' hairdryers and straighteners, in December last year.\nThe break-in was the 12th time the Newport salon had been broken into in 30 years.\n\"They just took the most expensive items, they knew what they were doing,\" said Ms Titmus.\n\"The first time it happened was some years ago. I came in on the Christmas weekend, our biggest weekend, they had taken every single item. \n\"I had to run around to all my friends and borrow dryers, scissors, just to be able to work that day.\n\"I was really very, very upset, but also angry. How dare they? I worked really hard all my life to have this, just for someone to come in and take it.\"\nMs Titmus said it had happened so many times she no longer made claims on her insurance because of the increase it would mean to her premium. \n\"Other times they've cost me \u00a3500 when they break a window and they probably had about 30p in pennies that were left in the drawer,\" she said.\n\"We just have to write it off as a loss. We work hard for a week to pay the burglar - that's how it works out.\" \nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the number of theft and burglary offences in England and Wales fell as many people stayed at home.\nMinister for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said, with levels expect to return to those seen before Covid-19, the tagging pilot was \"critical\".\n\"We want to make sure we help those offenders get back on the straight and narrow,\" he said.\n\"We think 24-hour-a-day supervision, through this tag on their ankle, will help them to realise that they're effectively being watched, and therefore choose something else to do, other than go back to their former crime.\n\"It's a rigorous supervision in a way that we haven't really seen before and we think it will have a big impact.\" \nMore than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released from prison, according to MoJ figures.\nIt said these types of crimes cost the public an estimated \u00a34.8bn a year, yet 79% of theft cases and 62% of robbery cases resulted in no suspect being identified - compared with an average of 24% in all other cases. \nFollowing the pilots, the MoJ said it planned to roll out the scheme, run by the National Probation Service, to a further 13 forces in September. \nTags have already been introduced in parts of England and Wales to monitor whether offenders who who were convicted of committing crimes while fuelled with alcohol, have been drinking.\nThe \"sobriety tags\" monitor sweat levels of the wearer every 30 minutes to see whether they have drunk alcohol. The probation service is then alerted if they have had a drink. \nGwent's Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said a small number of offenders were committing thefts, burglaries and robberies.\n\"Offenders tend to be serial offenders doing quite a lot of these types of crime over a short period of time, that can be very forensically aware, they can locate premises that aren't overlooked so there aren't any witnesses and then it becomes very difficult to pull those clues together to solve that particular crime. \n\"Obviously with the ability to be able to tag our persistent offenders it means we're able to see where they are and if they're in proximity of offences that have occurred,\" she said."

      "text": "St Patrick's Day celebrations will once again be different this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin have been cancelled for the second year in a row, with many events across the island again moving online. \nPolice have warned that anyone breaking Covid-19 regulations in NI will face a \"robust\" response.\nBut while large gatherings are mostly ruled out, attempts have been made to celebrate in style around the world.\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, a record number of places are taking part.\nSome 670 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nThe quirkiest additions to this year's list include an abandoned sauna in Finland and a Smurf statue in Brussels.\nHere's how other places in Northern Ireland and further afield are planning to mark the occasion:\nBelfast has an array of virtual events for people to enjoy from the comfort of their own homes throughout the month of March.\nAn online disco, Irish language festivals and a virtual guided tour of the city's street art are just some of the events on offer.\nSeveral live music events will also be streamed throughout St Patrick's Day, showcasing the city's talent. \nSt Joseph's Church in Sailortown is one such venue celebrating with an eight-hour live-streamed event.\nThe St Patrick's Centre in Downpatrick, County Down is celebrating with a number of online events for St Patrick's Day and also to mark its 20 year anniversary.\nA new show about St Patrick, a children's virtual art competition and a series of podcasts from former BBC politics correspondent Martina Purdy and ex-barrister Elaine Kelly, who are pilgrim guides on the new St Patrick's Way, are just some of the events on offer.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Purdy said that some of the guests involved on the podcast are journalist and presenter Eamonn Holmes, as well as Irish cellist Patrick Dexter, who has found online fame with his open-air recitals, shot outside his cottage in County Mayo. \n\"I was probably less aggressive than I was previously with some politicians,\" she said.\nIt is claimed that St Patrick is buried outside Downpatrick Cathedral. A large granite stone marks the spot, placed there in the early 20th century.\nThe council's Spring and St Patrick's Day programme promises to \"bring some colour\" to the city and district, according to mayor Brian Tierney.\nHe thanked event organisers for a programme that \"strikes a balance between giving the public something to look forward to and celebrate, while also keeping everyone safe\".\nEvent organiser Jacqueline Whoriskey said: \"While we will not be holding any public events or gatherings, we have focused in on how we can creatively bring the spring spirit to our streets with artwork and installations, with fairy dwellings and artistic sculptures that can be enjoyed by everyone when out getting some fresh air and exercise\".\nArmagh's At Home With St Patrick Festival includes events such as online wreath making and an Irish dancing master class. \nAll events are free of charge, however, some do require registration in advance.\nThe council is marking Irish Language Week and St Patrick's Day with a series of online performances and storytelling.\nAll events have moved online and the festival includes music and dance performances, streamed live from the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh and the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen.\nThe council is streaming a series of craft workshops, musical entertainment and dance performances live on social media channels throughout the day. \nPolice in Northern Ireland have appealed for anyone celebrating St Patrick's Day to ensure that they adhere to all public health regulations.\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland on Wednesday, through to the early hours of Thursday.\nThe substantial policing operation will see officers patrolling beauty spots and the Holyland area of south Belfast.\nPolice said that a number of gatherings have already been broken up by officers in south Belfast ahead of St Patrick's Day.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that people know the rules and those breaking them could face fines.\nSaint Patrick lived in the 5th Century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nWhile St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nThe city's St Patrick's Festival runs from 12 to 17 March, with more than 100 online events around the theme of Awaken Ireland.\nOrganisers have partnered with Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 for the virtual parade.\nThe celebrations will be broadcast around the world to a potential audience of 80 million people, organisers said.\nThe Queen has extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.\"\nPresident Michael D Higgins said that the British monarch's visit in 2011 was \"such a moment of healing\" and expressed his appreciation for her \"good wishes on our national day\". \nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition will continue this year, albeit virtually. The bowl will be placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders will discuss, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland, according to the White House.\nMr Biden, who has strong links to Mayo and Carlingford, will no doubt want to celebrate his Irish roots. \nBefore a visit to the land of his forefathers in 2016, the then US vice-president said: \"Being Irish, without fear of contradiction, has shaped my entire life.\"\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River event but the city's mayor was determined to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nChicago's mayor Lori Lightfoot tweeted: \"Happy St. Patrick's Day Weekend, Chicago! Although we didn't gather, we were able to honor long-standing tradition by dyeing the Chicago River green, thanks to the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers.\""

      "text": "Edinburgh's biggest bus operator has suspended evening services in the capital and Lothians following months of attacks.\nLothian Buses, which operates hundreds of buses, said its vehicles would not run after 19:30 except its NightBus service which starts after midnight.\nIt said it had taken the unprecedented step following months of incidents of antisocial behaviour.\nPolice have charged 18 people in connection with the recent attacks.\nLothian Buses said it would decide on Thursday if it would continue the measure.\nLarge stones were thrown at the windows of eight moving buses in two areas of Edinburgh on Monday evening.\nServices were suspended following the attacks on the vehicles in Gilmerton Road and Old Dalkeith Road. And services into Clermiston were suspended for a weekend following a serious attack in Drumbrae on 5 March.\nThe driver of the bus from the Drumbrae attack, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: \"I saw a youth coming to my side and he banged the side of the bus.\n\"Then I could see the rock coming towards my driver's window and it just shattered.\"\nThe driver was given an emergency appointment at the eye hospital and doctors said he had some abrasions to his cornea.\nHe added: \"That night I couldn't sleep. I kept hearing the noises, the bang especially.\n\"Normally, I am a very confident person but this has wiped me out and even the thought of going on a bus is now causing me quite big problems.\"\nSarah Boyd, Lothian Buses operations director, said: \"It is with pride that Lothian serves at the heart of our local communities and after the challenges of the last year it's frankly appalling that the actions of a few can directly impact on so many. \n\"However, driver and customer safety is our absolute priority and so it is with deep regret that we have to take this action.\n\"We understand that we provide a critical service for key workers and those for whom travel is essential and we can only apologise to these customers who we know will be inconvenienced by this decision.\"\nLyn Turner, Unite regional industrial officer said: \"Our members have the right to work without fear and we stand by Lothian's decision to withdraw services from areas in which they cannot operate safely. The safety of our members is paramount.\n\"We would urge communities to come together and provide information on those responsible for these dangerous acts of criminal behaviour which are putting the safety of our members and that of the public at serious risk.\"\nLesley Macinnes, City of Edinburgh Council's transport convener, said she was \"completely behind\" Lothian Buses' decision and urged anyone with information to contact police."

      "tags": "Carers,Social care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Leading care organisations in England are warning of a \"cliff edge\" when emergency funding to support infection control and visits during the pandemic runs out in two weeks.\nSome providers fear the financial pressure could force them to close.\nThey say the budget was a missed chance to tackle the short- and long-term funding crisis in adult social care.\nIn 2019, on his first day as prime minister, Boris Johnson committed to 'fix the crisis in social care'.\nMinisters say they will bring forward proposals this year. \nThe emergency funds are to help care homes and home care services with additional Covid costs, including infection control, visiting measures and extra staffing.\nThe Victory Care home in Chatham, Kent, which normally cares for 60 people, has used some of its emergency money on staff to organise visits and testing. \n\"Everything from extra newsletters, Zoom calls, the telephone calls, and then there will be additional resources put into ensuring people are tested, ensuring the tests are logged so that we know what our team's results are,\" says Raina Summerson, chief executive of Agincare, which runs the home. \nGerry Smith, whose mother Julia moved there last October, is tested every time she visits.\n\"We haven't got out of the pandemic yet, so we still need to keep the precautions going for a bit longer until everyone's had the vaccine that's going to have the vaccine and the numbers have dropped,\" says Ms Smith.\nBut if emergency funding stops in two weeks, there are fears about the impact on care home visiting, testing and even the survival of some providers. \nMs Summerson says whilst Agincare is secure, the care homes and home care services she runs have seen wage bills rise between 10% and 18% during the pandemic. \nBut, she says, fee rates offered by councils and the NHS for the year ahead are mainly staying the same or increasing by 1-2%. \n\"We will still have costs related to additional staffing for visiting, we will still need to be doing testing regularly, we will still need to be doing robust - more so than usual - infection control procedures,\" she says. \n\"Who will suffer through this lack of funding? People who desperately need services, and our workforce who have given so much over this last year. It feels like a real slap in the face for them.\" \nThe seven organisations which signed the statement call themselves an \"unprecedented alliance\" of local politicians, council social service directors, care providers and people who need support. \nThey say the absence of social care in the Budget was \"disappointing and a missed chance to provide much-needed certainty\". \nThey want the government to publish its long-promised social care reform plan by the summer.\nThree years ago, Christie Michael and her mother Maria moved from one area where they were both eligible for council support to another with a very different approach.  \nMaria has regular epileptic seizures, renal failure and diabetes. \nChristie has a rare condition that means her joints dislocate very easily. \nBut once they moved, Christie was not entitled to local authority funded help, and rather than four hours support a day, her mum was offered an hour and 15 minutes.\nThey say the council told them they would have to pay \u00a375 a week towards the care. \n\"We decided to stop the care, we just could not afford it.\n\"We already needed food banks before when we were getting free care,\" says Christie.\nShe is now her mother's full-time carer.\n\"I feel like I owe her and I want to do it, but it means that I don't have a life and it means that my physical health and my mental health is declining as well.\"\nChristie describes the care system as broken.\n\"I absolutely do not think you should get social care according to your postcode. \n\"It should be nationwide, available to everyone.\"\nThe full list of signatories is: "

      "tags": "Crime,Criminal justice system",
      "text": "A man with learning difficulties who admitted to a murder 30 years ago should have his conviction quashed because he confessed to police without a lawyer present, his solicitor says.\nOliver Campbell's confession would be ruled inadmissible today, Arthur Mullinger told BBC Newsnight.\nCampbell, who was 19 at the time, says he was \"put under pressure\" to \"admit to something that I didn't do\".\nPolice say the interviews were fair, while a judge ruled them admissible.\nMr Mullinger believes officers failed to tell him that his client - who was accused of shooting dead a London shopkeeper - had waived his right to a solicitor because they realised that he would try to change Campbell's mind.\nHe told Newsnight: \"The police did not have anything like sufficient evidence, probably even to get a prosecution off the ground, let alone a conviction without something more. And the more was going to be a confession.\"\nCampbell, 50, who suffered a brain injury when he was eight months old, has always protested his innocence and has been fighting his conviction for many years. He was released from prison on life licence in 2002.\nOn 22 July 1990, two men entered a shop in east London intent on robbery. The owner, 42-year-old Baldev Hoondle, pressed a panic alarm before one of the men pulled out a gun and shot him in the head at close range.\nNewsnight approached Mr Hoondle's family but they did not wish to participate in the programme.\nCampbell - a local teenager - was arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder and brought in for questioning at Hackney police station.\nOn 1 December 1990, Mr Mullinger attended a police interview with his client alongside an appropriate adult from social services who was there because the police accepted that Campbell was mentally vulnerable.\nMr Mullinger and the appropriate adult left at around 6.30pm thinking interviews were over for the day, with Mr Mullinger saying that police officers had agreed to call him back if that changed.\nThe police say Campbell then decided to confess to murder and had waived his right to a solicitor.\nOfficers then brought his foster mother in to the police station and she agreed to become the appropriate adult for the new interview, which went ahead without Mr Mullinger's knowledge.\nHe told Newsnight he was misled and believes the police realised that getting a confession would be less likely if Campbell was legally represented.\nHe said: \"The officer should have telephoned me and said, 'I think Oliver wants to speak to me. Will you come over to be part of the interview?' And I would have said, 'yes, of course'\u2026 And we would have had the interview. \n\"I don't know how that interview would have panned out, but it would have been undoubtedly a fair interview.\" \nCampbell's foster mother, who was a magistrate, was so shocked by his confession to murder that she was physically sick. She said at the time that she felt manipulated by the police.\nNewsnight obtained the original tapes of the police interviews conducted and traced the senior officer who interviewed Campbell in 1990.\nThe officer, who the BBC is choosing not to name, denies that the interview was unfair and told Newsnight he suspects Campbell is \"in denial of murder\", adding: \"When he was interviewed by me, he had the assistance of a solicitor or an appropriate adult to look after him... \n\"It is correct he did not have a solicitor present when he confessed. However, his appropriate adult was present throughout and he had waived his right to have his solicitor.\"\nHe added: \"His interview tape recordings were played at his trial and the jury had ample opportunity to consider whether or not his confession was genuine\", and said this was \"not the only evidence which incriminated him\".\nThe officer said the interviews were tape recorded and conducted in accordance with the Codes of Practice issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which applied at that time.\nBut Mr Mullinger and Campbell's current legal team say his conviction should be quashed because the confession would be ruled inadmissible today.\nGlyn Maddocks and Michael Birnbaum have been fighting to clear Campbell's name for the past 20 years.\nMr Maddocks said: \"Oliver Campbell is a mentally disabled person who was no match for a group of experienced and manipulative police officers. \n\"The 'admissions' Oliver made were inconsistent, varied noticeably from the evidence and in some places were quite absurd.\"\nMr Birnbaum QC said: \"I can't prove this - this is a strong suspicion [but] I think they realised that they were never going to get an admission from him if a solicitor was present.\"\nCampbell's confession statements were ruled admissible at his trial in 1991. Mr Birnbaum QC told Newsnight: \"The trial judge conducted a hearing about whether to admit that statement - declare it admissible - and said that there had been no impropriety by the police. \n\"But I don't believe the defence counsel brought up any of these to my mind pretty obvious points that could be made about the unfairness of the police conduct.\"\nThe prosecution relied on three main strands of evidence apart from Campbell's confession: \nBut Campbell's lawyers say his confession was key, and there was no solicitor present for that.\nCampbell was released from prison after serving 11 years in 2002 and is now living in sheltered accommodation in Suffolk. He is still a convicted murderer, a label he says is ruining his life. \nHe told Newsnight that the police questioning was unfair, adding: \"I was put under pressure\u2026 to say things that I didn't want to say at the end of the day\u2026 to admit to something that I didn't do. And I felt scared at the time.\"\nSome of the police interview tactics were later described by an independent psychologist as \"highly manipulative and relentless\", while one of the questions lasted almost three minutes.\nThe case is now being reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for the second time. In 2005, it decided not to refer it back to the Court of Appeal. A key reason for this was that it argued that many of the apparent weaknesses in evidence had already been considered by the courts.\nMr Birnbaum QC says there are fresh grounds today, both on the detail of the evidence and the circumstances surrounding Campbell's confession. \nHe said: \"The law and practise in regard to the way that mentally challenged suspects and defendants are treated has changed very considerably in their favour. \n\"Today his interviews would never be heard by a jury because of the unfairness of the police questioning and because I don't think the prosecution could prove that he understood the implications of being interviewed without a solicitor.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"The case was fully investigated at the time with a range of evidence brought before a jury who convicted the defendant in 1991. \n\"We are aware this matter is with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.\"\nWatch the full report on Newsnight at 22:45 GMT on Tuesday 16 March on BBC 2 or later on iPlayer."

      "tags": "Television",
      "text": "Sharon Osbourne has said she may not be wanted back, or want to go back, on US chat show The Talk after clashing with one of her co-hosts about Piers Morgan.\nShe said she had \"got too personal\" with co-presenter Sheryl Underwood and that she feared the row had escalated too far for her to return to the show.\nThe Talk has been taken off air and has extended its hiatus until next week.\nMeanwhile, Osbourne's spokesman has dismissed accusations of racism made against her as \"lies\".\nThe row on The Talk followed Oprah Winfrey's interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Morgan's subsequent departure from Good Morning Britain after saying he \"didn't believe a word\" she had said.\nOsbourne was one of the first people to voice support for Morgan, claiming he had the right to express his own opinion.\nHer comments were challenged on Wednesday's edition of The Talk, leading to an angry exchange with Underwood.\n\"I feel like I'm about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is racist, so that makes me a racist,\" Osborne said.\nShe later issued an apology, saying she had \"felt blindsided\" and had let her \"fear and horror of being accused of being racist take over\".\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday, Osbourne reiterated her apology and said she should have appreciated that Underwood was \"hurting\".\n\"I own up to what I did,\" she told the programme. \"I can't not own up. I said what I said. I got too personal with Sheryl.\"\nBut Osbourne also claimed she had been \"set up\" as a \"sacrificial lamb\" and had not been sufficiently prepared by The Talk's producers.\n\"I wish we could go on and have a adult conversation calmly and work it out but I don't know whether we can,\" she continued. \"I don't know whether it's gone past that.\n\"I would love to, but I don't know whether I even want to go back. I don't know whether I'm wanted there.\"\nThe Talk was due to return on Wednesday after US network CBS cancelled its Monday and Tuesday editions. However, the broadcaster has now said the show will not be back until next week while an internal investigation is carried out.\nCBS said it was \"committed to a diverse, inclusive and respectful workplace\" and was \"very mindful of the important concerns expressed and discussions taking place regarding events on The Talk\".\nIts statement said: \"This includes a process where all voices are heard, claims are investigated and appropriate action is taken where necessary. The show will extend its production hiatus until next Tuesday as we continue to review these issues.\"\nOsbourne, who is married to rock star Ozzy and has appeared as a judge on The X Factor and other shows, has been a panellist on The Talk throughout its 11 years on air.\nFollowing her comments last week, some former colleagues have come forward to make accusations about her.\nLast week, former co-presenter Holly Robinson Peete claimed Osbourne had complained she was too \"ghetto\" for the show, and that her job on the presenting line-up ended soon afterwards. Osbourne has denied making those comments or engineering her dismissal.\nUS journalist Yashar Ali has since reported allegations that Osbourne made racist remarks about former co-host Julie Chen.\nOsbourne's representative Howard Bragman issued a staunch defence. \"The only thing worse than a disgruntled former employee is a disgruntled former talk show host,\" he said.\n\"Sharon is disappointed but unfazed and hardly surprised by the lies, the recasting of history and the bitterness coming out at this moment. She will survive this, as she always has.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "title": "How do we know Covid vaccines are safe?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance",
      "text": "Customers who pay too much to their energy supplier through their monthly direct debit payment should receive automatic annual refunds, Ofgem says.\nFor years, customers have complained that energy firms can hoard thousands of pounds of overpayments and would only return it on request.\nNow the regulator has proposed balances are cleared once a year, claiming suppliers held a surplus of \u00a31.4bn.\nIt said some were using the money for \"unsustainable business practices\".\nEnergy UK, which represents suppliers, said direct debits evened out bills even though domestic gas and electricity use varied considerably during the year.\nFor the millions of customers paying by direct debit, energy firms set a sum to be collected each month. The amount is based on predictions of how much gas and electricity will be used, taking previous records into account.\nOften the balances go into credit in the summer, when less energy is used, before moving back closer to parity during the colder months.\nHowever, meter readings may show that direct debits have been set too high, meaning a customer has consistently overpaid.\nThis can build up, in some cases, to thousands of pounds. In 2016, the BBC reported how one customer was shocked to discover that his energy supplier owed him \u00a33,049 - with similar complaints having been made for years.\nCurrent rules state the onus is on the customer to request a refund of the money. The process can take months.\nNow, Ofgem has proposed that, from next year, companies automatically refund customers on the anniversary of the start of payments or their contract.\nThat would mean a customer who signed up with a firm in April, for example, would see their excess balance the following April automatically refunded into their bank account.\nOfgem estimates that people would receive \u00a365 on average, under the latest calculations.\n\"These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers' money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers' money,\" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem.  \n\"This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship.\" \nThe regulator said it had evidence that excess payments were being used by some suppliers to prop up parts of the business that would otherwise be unsustainable.\nTo prevent firms simply increasing direct debits during a year, the regulator is proposing a threshold for these payments. The methodology will be discussed during consultation.\nAny customers who owe money at the end of the year will, as is currently the case, receive a catch-up bill or see regular direct debits increased over the following year.\nThe Energy Ombudsman received 1,000 complaints about credit balances last year.\n\"Just as people are expected to pay their energy bills on time, we think it's fair to expect energy suppliers to do the same with refunds,\" said Ed Dodman, director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman.\n\"We know from looking at complaints that suppliers can sometimes take too long to issue refunds, which can be stressful for consumers.\"\nOn behalf of suppliers, Energy UK said: \"Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year. \n\"Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem's proposals.\""
