      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish independence",
      "text": "The Scottish government is to resume making the case for independence - with the goal of holding a referendum by the end of 2023.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a vote would only be held \"when the Covid crisis has passed\".\nBut she said work would restart on a \"detailed prospectus\" so that voters can make a \"fully informed\" choice.\nThe Scottish government had previously paused work on its indyref2 plans because of Covid. \nMs Sturgeon was speaking to MSPs as she set out her plans for the year ahead at Holyrood - including work to establish a National Care Service, reforms to the Gender Recognition Act and tighter regulation of fireworks.\nThe opposition Conservatives urged her to focus on recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic rather than independence.\nWith Holyrood's summer recess over, Ms Sturgeon was addressing MSPs in the wake of the SNP's election victory in May and the party's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nThe two parties form a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, and Ms Sturgeon said the government's \"democratic mandate\" to hold a fresh referendum was \"beyond question\".\nShe said this would only happen \"when the Covid crisis has passed\", but added that she wanted it to be \"before the end of 2023\".\nAnd she said civil servants would now resume work on a \"detailed prospectus\" for independence so that voters could make a \"fully informed\" choice.\nThe first minister has previously said she wants the agreement of the UK government to hold an independence referendum so that the result is put beyond any legal question.\nHowever Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he is not willing to agree to this in the immediacy, saying the focus should instead be on recovering from the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government has already published draft legislation for a new independence referendum.\nAnd Ms Sturgeon set out plans for a range of other new bills in her speech to MSPs, saying her plans would \"meet head on the key challenges Scotland faces\".\nThese include work to establish a National Care Service, which Ms Sturgeon said should be up and running within five years.\nShe also confirmed that a Gender Recognition Reform Bill would be tabled to make it easier for trans people to change their legally recognised gender.\nThe issue has caused deep divisions within the SNP, with the first minister acknowledging that \"some have sincerely held concerns about this legislation\", but insisting that \"it will make life easier for one of the most stigmatised minorities in our society\".\nThe government will also consult on changes to the justice system, including potentially scrapping the \"not proven\" verdict and separating the dual roles of Scottish law officers.\nOther proposals in the Programme for Government include:\nMs Sturgeon also nodded to her party's power-sharing deal with the Greens, telling MSPs that \"tackling the climate emergency is a moral and economic imperative\".\nThe Greens meanwhile claimed that the government's agenda was heavily influenced by their own policies, with co-leader Patrick Harvie saying they would \"lead efforts to lower emissions\".\nWhat Nicola Sturgeon has not done is announce plans to legislate for a referendum at Holyrood. \nTogether with their power-sharing partners in the Greens, the SNP has a majority to pass the bill \u2014 although without UK government agreement it would probably face a legal challenge. \nThe first minister is not, at this stage, formally requesting from Boris Johnson the explicit power to hold a referendum, knowing he's likely to refuse. \nInstead, she is restarting work by civil servants on the prospectus for independence. Work that was put on hold when coronavirus struck.\nShe will hope that will assuage her critics in the independence movement who don't think she's pushing hard enough for indyref2, with her party conference due this weekend. \nIt has also angered Conservatives and other supporters of the UK who think she is putting nationalist politics ahead of Covid recovery - a recovery the first minister insists remains her top priority. \nThe Conservatives were critical of the plans, with leader Douglas Ross saying Ms Sturgeon's priorities were all wrong.\nHe said: \"Another independence referendum is front and centre of the first minster's plans for the year ahead.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon is giving us a new white paper for independence instead of a plan for jobs, a plan to tackle drug deaths or a plan for NHS recovery.\"\nScottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said the government was \"short on big ideas\", saying: \"This isn't good enough, it isn't bold enough and it won't do enough.\"\nHe added: \"Barely a week goes by without someone from the government front bench declaring something mundane, rebadged or self-serving as historic. \n\"But the drier truth is that despite the SNP's rhetoric, the only historic thing today is levels of poverty in our streets, the numbers waiting for treatment in our hospitals and the depth of the economic crisis facing our country.\"\nAnd Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said there was \"little in the way of new hope\" in the programme, saying there was merely \"old hype, reheated and rebatched\"."

      "text": "Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has admitted making a \"mistake\" when he confused footballer Marcus Rashford with rugby player Maro Itoje.\nThe Evening Standard newspaper quoted Williamson as saying he had enjoyed a Zoom discussion with England and Manchester United's Rashford.\nBut an aide later clarified that it had actually been with Itoje.\nManchester-raised Rashford called the difference in accent between him and Londoner Itoje a possible \"giveaway\".\nItoje, who plays for England and Saracens, tweeted: \"Due to recent speculation I thought it was necessary to confirm that I am not Marcus Rashford\u2026 And whilst we are here my name is not Mario either!! Just a simple Maro Itoje will do\u2026\n\"Much love, Marcu\u2026 I mean Maro Itoje.\"\nBoth sportsmen are high-profile campaigners on issues involving children.\nRashford has spoken out on free school meals, while Itoje, who was educated at Harrow School, advocated for poorer pupils to get better access to laptop computers during lockdown.\nA spokesperson for Rashford said the footballer's \"consistent ask\" had been for collaboration with the government.\n\"More often than not this ask is rebuffed,\" the statement continued. \"Maro and Marcus are two incredibly successful young black men, but there is little more they have in common.\"\nLast year, the then Health Secretary Matt Hancock apologised for calling Rashford Daniel rather than Marcus.\n\"Whether it's Daniel Rashford or a Maro Itoje reference, the message remains the same,\" Rashford's spokesperson said. \"Put our children first.\"\nIn his interview with the Evening Standard, Williamson said of Rashford: \"We met over Zoom and he seemed incredibly engaged, compassionate and charming, but then he had to shoot off.\n\"I didn't want to be the one that was holding him back from his training.\"\nBut one of the education secretary's staff later clarified that he had meant Itoje rather than Rashford.\nAfter the article was published, Labour MP Zarah Sultana responded by calling Williamson a \"joke\".\nLiberal Democrat education spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said the mix-up had been \"shocking and embarrassing\", adding that minister had \"confused two black sporting heroes\".\nRashford himself gave a brief response, tweeting: \"Accent could have been a giveaway.\"\nIn a statement, Williamson said: \"Towards the end of a wide-ranging interview, in which I talked about both the laptops and school meals campaigns, I conflated the issues and made a genuine mistake. We corrected this with the journalist before publication of the story.\n\"I have huge respect for both Marcus Rashford and Maro Itoje, who run effective and inspiring campaigns.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Healthcare,Theranos trial,Fraud,United States",
      "text": "Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes \"lied and cheated\" for money and fame, prosecutors alleged on the first day of the former Silicon Valley star's trial. \nMs Holmes faces 12 fraud charges over her role at the now-defunct blood-testing firm which was once worth $9bn.\nShe is accused of deceiving investors and patients by claiming Theranos could detect common illnesses using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick.\nHer lawyers said she was simply a naive businesswoman whose firm failed.\n\"Failure is not a crime. Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime,\" Lance Wade, a lawyer for the defence said in his opening statement on Wednesday. \nIn what will be a closely watched trial in San Jose, California, Ms Holmes denies all the charges against her but could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.\nFormer Theranos executive Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani - who was romantically involved with Ms Holmes for years - faces the same charges but will be tried separately next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.\nMs Holmes, who founded Theranos in 2003 aged 19, was dubbed the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and the \"next Steve Jobs\" thanks to her technology.\nHowever, she fell from grace in 2015 when it emerged her blood-testing devices did not work and Theranos was doing most of its testing on commercially available machines made by other manufacturers.\nOn Wednesday, prosecutor Robert Leach said Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani turned to fraud in 2009 after big pharmaceutical firms declined to back Theranos and they ran out of cash. \nThey lied about the tests and exaggerated the firm's performance to secure millions of dollars of investment between 2010 and 2015. \nThis included falsely claiming the tests had been vetted by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and that the technology was being used by the US military in the field, Mr Leach said. \nMs Holmes came into the court surrounded by her legal team. There's huge interest in the case here.\nJournalists had been queuing up since 5am to try and get into court. Many didn't get in.\nEschewing the black turtleneck she had become famous for, Ms Holmes wore a grey suit and blue mask. In court, she sat bolt upright, poised, attentive, as she listened to the case against her.\nThe prosecution didn't mince its words. The word \"lies\" was mentioned liberally. Ms Holmes watched on passively.\nThe case will probably take months and at some point it's possible that Ms Holmes herself will take the stand. \nIf she does it will be a huge risk for her defence. But with so much evidence that the tech she flaunted didn't work she may feel it's a risk worth taking.\nMs Holmes also \"dazzled\" firms such as Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, into agreeing testing partnerships, despite being fully aware the tests were \"plagued by issues and repeatedly failing quality control\", he said. \nIt brought her fame and adoration, Mr Leach added.\n\"She had become, as she sought, one of the most celebrated CEOs in Silicon Valley and the world. But under the facade of Theranos' success there were significant problems brewing.\"\nHowever, the defence's Mr Wade said Ms Holmes did not intend to defraud, but instead \"naively underestimated\" the challenges her business faced. \n\"In the end, Theranos failed and Ms Holmes walked away with nothing,\" he told the jurors in San Jose. \nHe added that the former executive was motivated by Theranos's mission, not money, and \"committed to that mission until that very last day\".\n\"By the time this trial is over, you will see that the villain the government just presented is actually a living, breathing human being who did her very best each and every day. And she is innocent.\"\nAccording to court filings unsealed last month, Ms Holmes has alleged Mr Balwani abused her emotionally and psychologically for years. Mr Balwani has denied the allegations.\nHer lawyers have said she is \"highly likely\" to take the witness stand and testify about how the relationship affected her mental state. \nAs boss of Theranos Ms Holmes is alleged to have duped a host of powerful people who invested around $700m in the company. Henry Kissinger and four star general James Mattis sat on the company's board while Rupert Murdoch invested \u00a3120m.\nHer story has become the subject of documentaries, podcasts and books. A TV miniseries and a Hollywood film based her life are in the works.\nThe defence and prosecution have identified more than 140 potential witnesses in the case, including investors and former Theranos employees."

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,UK immigration,France,Home Office,English Channel,Priti Patel,Migration",
      "text": "The home secretary is expected to hold talks with her French counterpart about the number of migrants crossing the English Channel to the UK.\nPriti Patel and Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin are both due to attend a meeting of G7 ministers in London.\nShe has warned that Britain could withhold \u00a354.2m it had promised to pay France to help deal with the problem, unless more boats are intercepted.\nThe Home Office said 785 people crossed the channel in small boats on Monday.\nMore than 12,600 people have made the dangerous journey so far this year.\nThe rise in the number of migrants making the crossing in recent days comes after several weeks of unsettled weather.\nBack in July the UK agreed to pay France to step up patrols along the French coast in order to deter crossings.\nOn Tuesday, the prime minister's official spokesman said UK and French officials were \"working on the implementation\" of the deal and that \"significant\" funding provided in November had already led to increased patrols and \"enhanced intelligence\".\nHe said that following a period of poor weather there had been an increase in crossings but warned that the journey remained \"extremely dangerous\".\n\"We remain determined to fix the broken asylum system and break the business model of people smugglers who put lives at risk, and welcome people through safe and legal routes,\" he added.\nAnd speaking during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said efforts to stop the illegal crossings of the English Channel depended \"to a large extent\" on the ability of the French authorities.\nHe was responding to a question from the Conservative MP, Lee Anderson, who urged ministers to \"take some direct action and send the boats straight back\" because \"thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants\" are landing on Kent's shores every month. \nThe PM said it was a \"perennial problem\" and the home secretary was \"dealing with it in the best possible way, which is to make sure that they don't leave those French shores\". \nHe added: \"Clearly, as time goes on and this problem continues, we are going to have to make sure that we use every possible tactic at our disposal to stop what I think is a vile trade and a manipulation of people's hopes.\" \nBut speaking earlier on Radio 4's Today programme, Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont, said \"nothing\" can stop migrants crossing the Channel and it is \"impossible\" for French police to patrol the whole shoreline.\n\"The fact is, we've got 300 to 400 kilometres of shore to monitor every day and every night and it's quite impossible to have police officers every 100 metres because of the length of the shore\" he said. \nThere are \"numerous causes\" why people attempt the journey in the first place, including the warmer weather, migrants being more likely to speak English and the perception that it is easier to find work in the UK, he said.\nHe added: \"We have more and more patrols. \n\"The money that was promised to be given by the UK government to France is set to maintain this number of patrols that we already doubled a few weeks ago.\"\nAhead of the meeting, Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, Steve Valdez-Symonds, said without a change of policy by the government, the talks were a \"lost cause\". \n\"The home secretary can keep on spending public money, but nothing is going to change unless she is prepared to change her failed and unworkable policies\" he said. \n\"People have every right to seek asylum in the UK,\" he said, adding \"they only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them\".\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called for the government to focus on finding a \"workable solution with the French authorities, tackling vile people-smuggling gangs and properly managing safe routes to prevent people risking their lives\"."

      "tags": "NI education,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Public Health Agency (PHA) is set to take over responsibility for the contact tracing of close contacts of Covid-19 cases in schools, BBC News NI understands.\nIf approved, the move is expected to reduce the number of pupils who have to self-isolate and miss time in school.\nIt is also expected to ease demand for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\nSchools will be urged to encourage pupils to take twice-weekly lateral flow device (LFD) tests.\nThe aim is also to ease the burden placed on principals and school leaders to trace close contacts.\nThe Ulster Teachers' Union said schools had faced a \"tsunami\" of Covid-19 cases and related absences in recent days.\nPrincipals' representatives and teaching unions are expected to be consulted on the plans later.\nThey are similar to arrangements for schools currently in place in England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe change will certainly improve things for school principals and senior school staff who have had to take on the bulk of contact tracing at the minute, when there has been a positive case. \nThey could contact the PHA for advice, but many principals reported it could take a while for them to get that advice. \nReally it has been down to principals and schools to do the bulk of contact tracing when there is a positive case in school. \nI think sometimes they have perhaps been erring on the side of caution, and sending whole year groups home if there has been a positive case, or whole classes. \nI think the PHA might be able to be a bit more forensic in identifying exactly who was a close contact. \nThat means the surge in demand for PCR tests in some parts of Northern Ireland would be somewhat reduced.\nNew self-isolation guidance for schools was issued on 26 August.\nIt changed previous guidance for close contacts to isolate for 10 days and aimed to reduce the time children spent out of school.\nBut the logistical burden of tracing asymptomatic close contacts has, in the main, been the responsibility of school principals and staff.\nThat has also led to high numbers of pupils self-isolating and seeking negative PCR tests to return to school.\nAny child with symptoms is still expected to stay off school and get a PCR test.\nIf that is positive they must self-isolate for 10 days.\nIf the move is approved by principals' representatives and unions, guidance on how the new arrangements will operate will be provided to schools.\nA number of teaching unions in Northern Ireland have called for the PHA to take responsibility for identifying close contacts of pupils in schools.\nPrincipal from Maghaberry Primary School and President of National Association of Headteachers NI (NAHTni) Graham Gault said the development was a \"significant step\".\nHe said contact tracing should never have fallen to school leaders.\nChris Donnelly, principal of St John The Baptist Primary School in Finaghy, said that while schools \"will welcome the easing of any type of administrative burden associated with contact tracing\" it was the case that \"the devil will be in the detail\". \nJustin McCamphill from teachers' union NASUWT said that while taking the job of contact tracing \"away from school principals\" was welcome, the union was urging caution around the proposals. \n\"We do worry that the PHA may not have the capacity to identify close cases as quickly as school principals did,\" Mr McCamphill told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"The experience of our leaders over the past few weeks has been that they have difficulty getting through to the PHA advice line.\n\"We think now if parents and pupils are making direct contact we don't know if the capacity is going to be there.\n\"The other issue of course is that if a six or seven-year-old is a close contact and gives their friend's name, how are the PHA going to make contact with that friend without going back through the school?\"\nMr McCamphill added that the union did not see the plan as \"something that's going to fix everything straight away\".\nIn England, Scotland and Wales public health authorities take on the responsibility for tracing close contacts of school pupils.\nIn Wales, for instance, the Test, Trace and Protect (TTP) programme gathers information from positive cases on their close contacts.\nChildren under 16 are spoken to alongside a parent or guardian.\nThe public health authorities, rather than schools, then advise close contacts whether they have to self-isolate or seek a PCR test.\nSimilar arrangements are in place in Scotland with the aim that whole classes or year groups are not routinely asked to stay at home in the event of a positive case."

      "tags": "NI education,Contact tracing,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled to discuss the situation regarding Covid-19 in schools.\nThe speaker has decided that the recall, which follows a petition put forward by Sinn F\u00e9in, will take place on Thursday at 12:00 BST. \nSome principals have expressed concern that guidance on testing and tracing has caused a high number of pupils to miss classes.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan has suggested a quicker test could be used.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen said proposals for dealing with Covid school absences were being finalised, and would be discussed with the education sector this week. \nShe said discussions had been ongoing between her department and the Department of Health. \nAssembly members were officially due to resume assembly business on Monday.\nThe recall, proposed by Pat Sheehan MLA, needed 30 signatures to pass.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen needed to give \"clear guidance\" and put in place enough resources to support staff in keeping schools open, he said.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Givan, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) colleague of the minister, said the executive may need to consider other options for Covid-19 testing and contact tracing in schools.\nIt comes after more than half of the pupils at Larne High School were absent on Monday because they were in close contact with a positive case.\nThe current guidance issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) last month advised that close contacts of a positive case can avoid self-isolation if they had recently tested positive themselves and present no symptoms.\nOtherwise, if a pupil is a close contact and has no symptoms but has not had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the previous 90 days, they are advised to self-isolate until they have taken a test.\nMr Givan said this policy was supported by all the parties in the executive and should be followed, rather than children having to self-isolate for the previous requirement of 10 days.\nThe word that you hear a lot is \"unsustainable\". Principals are saying they can't go on like this. \nMichael Carville, who is head of Regent House, a secondary school in Newtownards with 1,400 pupils, said to me on Monday that he hasn't done any education since he got back to school at the start of term. It it has been all contact tracing.\nAnd a number of other heads [principals] are in the same position. \nWe are only just a week into term, and there is a recognition right across the board that it cannot go on like this. \nThe problem is, what do we do about it?\nAny major change in self-isolation rules would have to be approved by the executive.\nIt is hard to know if that would be palatable to the executive, or what other changes could be made without executive approval.  \nMr Givan conceded it was \"becoming difficult\" to find available slots for PCR tests and questioned if the education system should \"go back to a system of lateral flow testing\", which are not as accurate but provide quick results.\nHe told BBC News NI that such tests were considered sufficient for access to venues such as sporting events and could be \"carried out at home by parents\".\n\"Every option needs to now be considered because if the system within the Public Health Agency cannot support principals to implement a policy which was to prevent children being put out for 10 days and to have a turnaround of 24 hours, then we need to be considering other options,\" he said.\nBut St John the Baptist Primary School principal Chris Donnelly said lateral flow testing did not give the same security.\nTwo classes at the Finaghy school were sent home because of positive cases last week, he said. \nOver the weekend he asked parents to provide documentary proof of negative PCR tests. \nThe same documentary proof would not be available with a lateral flow test, he said. \nHe said he also had to stop two children from coming into school because they had not been tested.\n\"There's a trade-off in society at the moment. We know that opening the schools can only do one thing. It's only going to lead in an increase in the number of cases,\" he told BBC's Evening Extra programme. \n\"But we understand that society needs to function. If we're going to have that system in place then we need to trust that the system is robust.\n\"I do not think relying on lateral flow tests is robust, I don't think that it would provide the reassurance that parents, that staff members and school leaders need.\"\nBrain Guthrie, head teacher of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, said the first positive cases since the school year started were identified at the end of last week.\nHe told BBC Radio Foyle some of the messages coming from the PHA have been mixed.\n\"If a child tests positive here at Ebrington, having reported cases before I am feeling confident enough myself to get information out to parents. We have our letter ready to go, we adjust the date appropriately,\" he said.\n\"I then make the phone call through to PHA and make them aware of that. The only thing is, is the pressure of time, the amount of added administration that is putting on principals.\"\nLori Campbell, who is a mum of four and also works as a childminder in Londonderry, was instructed to take one her children home when she arrived at the school gates on Monday.\n\"Her class was involved in a close-contact situation and they needed us to return home and organise a PCR test,\" Mrs Campbell told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"It left me in a situation where I was meant to be working, I had another child on board who was then at risk and my husband was at work.\"\nShe said her daughter's Covid-19 test results came back negative.\n\"If her test had came up positive, I would have to close my business and that would be me closed until her PCR test came back clear,\" she said.\n\"That's not a great position to be in and not a great position to then land other parents in who have to come and pick up their child.\"\nMrs Campbell has called for the current testing and tracing protocols in schools to be changed.\nBBC News NI asked the Department of Education and Education Authority (EA) for figures for the number of pupils absent from class, but they directed us to the PHA.\nThe PHA directed us to a Covid-19 bulletin, which has not been updated since August 29.\nStormont education committee chair Chris Lyttle said he had requested that both the PHA and chief medical officer attend Wednesday's education committee meeting. \n\"We need greater clarity on what the evidence is behind the system we have in place, and whether the system is operating as it is supposed to,\" said the Alliance assembly member.\nSDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the lack of planning by the Department of Education had \"plunged schools into crisis\".\n\"I have been inundated by school principals complaining about the current guidance, it's not fit for purpose and resulted in them and their staff spending countless hours focused on contact tracing and other Covid-related issues instead of education,\" he said.\nFollowing the absence levels at Larne High School, the PHA set up a mobile testing facility at Larne Leisure Centre.\nThe real business on Thursday may not happen within the assembly chamber but at the executive meeting which is also due to take place.\nThe education and health ministers have been tasked by the executive to go off and listen to what's been said by teachers on the ground, to speak to public health officials and the chief medical officer.\nThey will come back to the executive on Thursday with some proposals as to how they may be able to tackle this current crisis.\nIt was anticipated there was going to be difficulties but ministers have now found themselves in the position where they are going to have to look again at this problem.\nPerhaps the scale of the problem that was coming down the track was underestimated.\nBehind the scenes, there is probably a lot of scrambling going on.\nOn Sunday, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said some schools had decided not to follow the PHA guidance because they feared it could lead to greater infection rates.\nThe union said some principals would like pupils to have longer self-isolation periods to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their classmates.\nThe first minister said he wanted the Department of Health to provide an update on the situation at Thursday's executive meeting.\nUp to 12,000 pupils are out of school in the Republic of Ireland, RT\u00c9 has reported.\nAbout 1,300 schools are reporting cases but the \"vast majority\" are traced to community transmission and not picked up in school, according to the Health Service Executive.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said \"we are seeing a large number of students having to self-isolate because they have been deemed to be close contacts and they of course will get tested\"."

      "text": "Three central figures caught up in the events around Holy Cross Primary School in north Belfast in 2001 have been speaking about the sectarian dispute.\nLoyalist protesters tried to block the route taken by the school's pupils and their parents, who were from a Catholic background, on their walk to class.\nThe then school principal, a Presbyterian minister and a Catholic priest say the scars are still there.\nOnly now can Fr Gary Donegan even bring himself to speak of the events because it is still so raw. \nHe was a young priest starting out when it began.\n\"I had only just arrived - it was actually my birthday when the thing kicked off,\" he said.\n\"But by 3 September when the worst part of it was actually taking place I suppose I was really shocked, because to some extent children were sacrosanct and they were right in the midst of this.\"\nTwenty years later, Anne Tanney still wonders if it really happened.\nMrs Tanney, who was the principal of Holy Cross Girls' Primary School at the time, said the worst moment was when a pipe bomb exploded as the children were walking to school through the lines of police officers keeping back the loyalist protestors.\n\"I was in the school and we heard this explosion outside and we knew the children were coming,\" she said.\n\"We ran out down to the gate and I thought there would be a child carried in dead or somebody would be dead, but they were in a terrible state.\" \nThe dispute was worldwide news which worried the Reverend Norman Hamilton, who is now a retired Presbyterian minister.\n\"I remember, more than once, being quite taken aback at the range of media who were there from Australia, from Canada, from France, even from the Far East,\" he said.\n'Serious psychological damage'\nDr Hamilton said he wondered what it was doing \"not just to this community to be exposed on the world stage but what is it doing to Northern Ireland to be exposed like this on the world's stage?\"\nAs for Fr Donegan, he said when the 10th anniversary came around he \"deliberately suppressed any kind of marking of it\" because it was such a raw experience.\n\"I think long-term there was serious psychological damage done, \" he said.\n\"I buried a couple of the mothers and, ironically, their children were able to move on but they were not.\n\"I've been offered book deals. I've been offered all kinds of things, but until now I've said I want to focus on now. You can't forget, we'll never forget what actually happened, but I want to focus on what's actually happening now.\"\nSo 20 years on what is happening now?\n\"I don't think it will be replicated but I have to say I am a bit troubled in the back of my mind that tensions can arise and go in unexpected directions, not in this area, particularly, but just generally,\" said Dr Hamilton.\n\"I think, to be honest, we are in a sort of stalemate because the big political picture works itself out by default at local level, so whilst the communities are at greater ease with each other I'm not sure, in terms of reconciliation, and the building of close, mutually supportive relationships that we have progressed very much.\n\"The political fracturing is still a real problem. You cannot expect local communities to do what big-picture politicians are either unwilling or unable to do.\" \nFr Donegan said it was important for people with experience to move in quickly when tensions started to rise.\n\"I believe if it had happened in one of the leafy suburb schools the unions would have been out, the educationalists would have been out. But it's kind of like: 'It's Ardoyne, it's the Shankill'  -  you know to some extent we're alright jack sort of,\" he said.\n\"I find, sometimes, people who don't have experience, even pastors or priests... a lot of these people wouldn't know an interface if it walked up and shook them by the hand and sometimes they are better actually not being there.\n\"We won the peace inch by inch and people like Norman and I now are not prepared to let any shrinkage.\n\"We're prepared to hold on to those inches, so if we see anyone in some way starting to impinge on that, we have a moral obligation and a duty to get in there and actually do something about it.\"\nMrs Tanney says the school received cards and calls from people all over the world. She and her husband were even offered a free holiday in New Zealand.\nShe says it was important to tell the children there were many good people in the outside world who could be trusted.\n\"It's a terrible thing for a child to grow up thinking that they're in a world they can't trust and where their parents can't help them,\" she said.\n\"And it was very bad for parents because they felt they couldn't protect their children and that's the worst thing that can happen to a parent.\" "

      "text": "Online shopping giant Amazon has said it is \"proud\" of its contribution to the UK economy, as it reveals its latest financial results.\nThe firm paid \u00a3492m in direct taxation as its sales rose 50% to \u00a320.63bn, amid a Covid-driven surge in demand.\nAmazon and other tech firms, which pay tax on profits not sales, have faced scrutiny over the level of their tax bills in the UK.  \nBut Amazon said it had invested \u00a332bn in UK infrastructure since 2010.\n\"We are proud of the significant economic contribution we are making to the UK economy,\" Amazon said in a statement.\n\"Looking ahead, we know that the UK remains full of opportunity and we continue to be excited by the potential to continue to invest, create jobs, develop talent and have a positive impact in communities across the country,\" the statement added. \nAmazon's total sales in the UK, rose to \u00a320.63bn during 2020 - up by more than 50% from \u00a313.73bn in 2019.  \nThe direct tax bill was up by more than two-thirds compared with the \u00a3293m it paid in the previous year. \nThe firm, which employs 55,000 people in the UK, said the taxes included business rates, stamp duty, corporation tax and other contributions.\nAmazon said employers' national insurance taxes accounted for the majority of the bill as it took on 22,000 more staff over the course of the last year.\nThe company's indirect tax bill came to \u00a31.06bn, up from \u00a3854m, driven by VAT on increased sales and employee taxes, as it took on more people and increased wages. \nAmazon said that when both direct and indirect taxation were taken into account, it had contributed \u00a31.55bn, up from \u00a31.15bn. \nGMB, the union for Amazon workers, said the company's tax bill was \"frankly insulting\" and said firms that had profited from the pandemic should pay more.\nMick Rix, GMB National Officer, said:\"Amazon workers suffer unsafe, dehumanising work practices; breaking bones, falling unconscious and being taken away in ambulances.\n\"Ministers must get a grip of this runaway company and make sure pandemic profiteers pay more.\n\"Amazon's key UK business paid just \u00a33.8m more corporation tax last year than in 2019, even as sales increased by \u00a31.89bn.\" \nIn April last year, the UK government launched a 2% tax on digital sales amid concerns that big tech firms were re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions. The Digital Services Tax is also included in the \u00a3492m figure. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said in June last year that the coronavirus crisis had made tech giants even \"more powerful and more profitable\".\nOther global tech firms have faced similar scrutiny over their tax bills.\nFrench tax authorities recently settled disputes with Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon over their operations in the country over the last decade. \nLast year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech firms and backed plans by think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to find a global solution.\n\"As usual the accounts are legally compliant but opaque and lack the crucial information about intra-group transactions which enable the company to shift profits is not there,\" said Labour peer and emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield and University of Essex, Prem Sikka.\n\"Therefore it's impossible to know what their true economic profit is,\" Prof Sikka said.  \nGiven the profits declared by competitors, Prof Sikka said Amazon's tax bill \"seems very low\", whereas, for retailers such as supermarket chains, tax bills as a proportion of sales were much higher.  \n\"We need a complete change in accounting regulations which currently increase opacity rather than transparency,\" Prof Sikka added. \nProfessor of taxation law at King's College London, Ann Mumford agreed and said that there was a lack of public discussion around the rules which led to this amount of tax. \n\"It seems that Amazon realised that they would need to pay a respectable amount - and, are hoping that an increase of \u00a33.8 million sounds like a lot of money,\" Prof Mumford added. \nThe pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online shopping and Amazon has been one of the biggest winners amid those changing consumer trends. \nAs Covid closed physical stores during successive lockdowns, sales at the internet giant rocketed. \nToday's numbers will raise further questions about how tech giants operate, the level of tax they pay and their impact on the struggling High Street. \nAmazon moved to fend off criticism by pointing out that its direct tax bill increased by more than two-thirds from the \u00a3293m it paid in 2019. \nCritics say that's still nowhere near enough given the surge in sales. \nThe firm's been on a hiring spree to meet soaring demand, offering a \u00a31,000 joining bonus to encourage staff to work in its fulfilment centres in the north east of England."

      "text": "\"How do you get up from an all time low?,\" The Wanted asked in their debut single in 2010.\nBut in 2021 the question is now: How do you come back from a seven-year break?\nBecause, yes, the chart-topping boy band have announced their return, a greatest hits album, a new single and a live charity gig.\nThe five-piece group - Max George, Siva Kaneswaran, Jay McGuiness, Tom Parker and Nathan Sykes - made the announcement on Wednesday.\nDiscussions about a reunion first took place in 2020, but as with a lot of things, the pandemic forced the group to put the brakes on the idea at first.\nA second setback came when Tom Parker was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.\nBut after starting treatment, and \"responding well\", Tom began working with the charity Stand Up To Cancer on a Channel 4 documentary and a live show at London's Royal Albert Hall - where The Wanted will reunite to perform later this month.\n\"It feels amazing. It's quite nice to be able to do something again that's not related to treatment,\" Tom said at a press conference to announce the reunion.\n\"It's been a very sad eight months, so it's been nice to smile again, for me.\"\n\"We have been talking off and on for a few years now about getting back together... but have all been working on other projects at different times so it didn't happen,\" Jay adds in a statement. \n\"This is all about having fun with our mates, no pressure, just fun.\"\nThe gig is on 20 September and will also include performances from Liam Payne, Becky Hill, McFly, KSI and Sigrid.\nThe Wanted's greatest hits collection will be released on 12 November.\nDuring their four years in the spotlight, the group scored two number one singles and a string of Top Ten singles and albums.\nTheir biggest hit, 2011's Glad You Came, also achieved the rarest of feats for British pop acts - it went big in America too.\nAfter the band split in 2014, only Nathan scored solo success with music. He's had two UK top 20 singles, including Over and Over Again, a duet with Ariana Grande.\nMax had a minor role in Glee after the boys parted, and appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2020. He was initially signed as solo music artist by Scooter Braun, who also manages Justin Bieber.\nSiva wrote the UK's 2016 Eurovision entry, You're Not Alone by Joe and Jake, which came 24th out of 26 countries.\nJay won Strictly Come Dancing in 2015 and has appeared in musicals in London's West End.\nTom has released solo music and appeared on reality TV shows such as Celebrity Masterchef and The Jump, as well as touring the UK in the lead role in a production of Grease. \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

She was later released on bail.\nShe was due on Wednesday to represent an opposition politician charged under the national security law at a bail hearing, but was arrested at her office before she could appear in court.\nChina recently imposed a broadly-worded national security law in Hong Kong that criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. \nCritics say it is aimed at crushing dissent but China says it is meant to maintain stability.\nIn June, Chow Hang Tung spoke to BBC Chinese explaining why she was encouraging those in Hong Kong to remember the Tiananmen crackdown."

      "tags": "Taliban,Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund,United States",
      "text": "Anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan have asked the international community not to recognise the new government announced by the Islamists on Tuesday.\nThe all-male cabinet consisting entirely of Taliban leaders or their associates is \"illegal\", they said.\nThe US has expressed concern that the interim government includes figures linked to attacks on US forces. \nAnd the EU said the Islamist group had reneged on promises to make it \"inclusive and representative\".\nThe interim cabinet is led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, who is on a UN blacklist. Another figure, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is wanted by the American FBI.\nThe National Resistance Front (NRF) said it considered the announcement of the Taliban's caretaker cabinet \"a clear sign of the group's enmity with the Afghan people\".\nThe Taliban insist they have now defeated the NRF in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, but NRF leaders say they are still fighting.\nIn a statement, the US state department said it was concerned by the \"affiliations and track records of some of the individuals\".\nThe statement said Washington would \"continue to hold the Taliban to their commitments\" to allow safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans with travel documents, \"including permitting flights currently ready to fly out of Afghanistan\".\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken is to hold a virtual meeting of 20 Western nations to co-ordinate a set of conditions for engagement with the Taliban government.\nThe Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in a sweeping offensive more than three weeks ago. It now faces many tough challenges in the conflict-torn country, including stabilising the economy and gaining international recognition.\nOn Wednesday dozens of women marched in Kabul and in the province of Badakhshan, saying they would not accept a government without women.\nThe Taliban deny using violence against the demonstrations. They say protesters need permission to march and should not use abusive language.\nPakistan also denies any role in Afghanistan.\nEarlier on Tuesday, a statement attributed to Taliban Supreme Leader Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada told the government to uphold Sharia law - Islam's legal system. The Taliban have been known for their extremely hardline interpretation of Sharia.\nThe Taliban want \"strong and healthy\" relations with other countries and would respect international laws and treaties as long as they did not conflict with \"Islamic law and the country's national values\", the group's statement said.\nHassan Akhund, the new interim prime minister, served as deputy foreign minister from 1996 to 2001, when the militants were last in power. He is influential on the religious side of the movement, rather than the military side.\nHis appointment is seen as a compromise, after recent reports of in-fighting between some relatively moderate Taliban figures and their hardline colleagues.\nThe group had previously said it wanted to form an inclusive government.\nSirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister, is head of the militant group known as the Haqqani network, who are affiliated with the Taliban and have been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country's two-decade-long war - including a truck bomb explosion in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people.\nUnlike the wider Taliban, the Haqqani network has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. It also maintains close ties to al-Qaeda.\nThe FBI says he is wanted for questioning over a 2008 attack on a hotel that killed an American and was behind attacks on US forces in Afghanistan. \nA movement which has long moved in the shadows, whose names would surface only on the world's terrorism watch lists, is now announcing titles used in governments the world over. \nActing prime minister Mullah Akhund appears as a compromise candidate after reported rivalries among leading military and political figures who will serve under him. \nIts caretaker nature also provides breathing space as the Taliban move from guns to government. \nIt also underlines the Taliban view that a Taliban victory can only mean Taliban rule. Sources say they pushed back against calls for an \"inclusive\" government. They balked at including former political figures and officials, who've had their turn at the top, and especially those tainted by corruption. \n\"Why should we let others pick our cabinet when other countries pick their own? \"was one retort. \nAs for women, there was never a chance they would be given a ministerial role; the ministry of women's affairs seems to have been, for now, abolished altogether.  \nOther appointments to the new government include:"

If you live in certain parts of Wales you should be asking yourself: 'Am I getting fair service from my MP when I need them?'\"\nMeanwhile, Labour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant said \"it is a deliberate campaign by the Conservatives\" to get people who typically vote against them to vote for them.\nMr Bryant also criticised the UK government's proposal to pass a law requiring people to show an approved form of identification in order to vote. \n\"Many people in my constituency and people who live in transient communities in cities who normally tend to vote labour are going to find it more difficult to register, vote and participate in democracy\", he added.\nBut according to Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, \"it's no longer clear whether the Conservatives will necessarily lose significantly less than Labour\" in Wales after proposed boundary reform."

Guards unlocked some cells but had to leave as the fire raged.\nThere were 122 inmates staying in the worst-affected Block C - far more than the 40-person capacity.\nTwo foreign victims, inmates from Portugal and South Africa, are among the dead.\nIndonesia's Minister of Law and Human Rights Yasonna Laoly said in a press conference that the embassies of the respective countries had been informed.\nEight people were seriously injured and dozens more had minor injuries, he said.\nTelevision footage showed thick smoke billowing from the prison complex as the fire raged. It started at about 01:45 local time (18:45 GMT Tuesday) and was put out just over an hour later.\n\"The fire spread quickly and there was no time to open some cells... When the guards found out, the fire had already spread, and that's where we found the victims,\" Mr Yasonna told a press conference.\nHe said that an electrical short-circuit was thought to be the cause of the blaze, although this was still being investigated.\nThe jail was built in 1972 and its electrical system had not been updated since then, he said.\nThe block mainly housed inmates held for drug-related offences.\nOf the victims, one was reported to be a murder convict, another had been found guilty of terrorism, and the rest were in prison for crimes involving drugs. \nDr Hilwani from Tangerang General Hospital told Reuters some of the bodies were so badly burned they could not be identified. DNA tests are being used.\nOne relative of a victim, Marlinah, told the AFP news agency outside the hospital: \"I saw a viral video of the fire. Then I heard that my brother might have been killed. Then we rushed here. All we hope for now is that the procedure will not be too complicated so we can bring my brother's body for burial.\"\nOnly 15 guards were on duty for the entire building, which housed 2,000 inmates - a far higher number than its intended 600-person capacity.\nPrison overcapacity is a persistent problem in Indonesian jails.

I thought it'd be really cool to see if I could get to champions division as a solo, which I did. \n\"I've been doing various competitions but not yet won any cash cups and I've got a long way to go, but I'm trying.\"\nGalaxy Racer CEO, Paul Roy, explained why the company has signed her: \"We are thrilled to announce mamabenjyfishy as the newest addition to Galaxy Racer's content creator team. \n\"Having proved her Fortnite skills at our recent tournament, The Aubameyang Cup, her years of experience in the industry, including managing Benjyfishy, and a shared passion for nurturing greater inclusivity within gaming and esports, we are proud to welcome Anne into the Galaxy Racer family.\"\nAnne's son Benjy says \"it's pretty mad\" that his mum is now a signed gamer.\n\"Yeah I mean it's pretty weird because obviously back in the day I always wanted to be a gamer, and the fact that my mum is now like technically a pro game streamer is pretty sick.\n\"I never would have thought this could happen three years ago. If you had told me that I wouldn't believe it - it's pretty mad.\"\nBenjyfishy is ranked as one of the top 10 players in the world by multiple websites and was one of a handful of British players to make it to the Fortnite World Cup in New York in 2019. \nHe says he's given his mum a few tips but that he mainly \"lets her get on with it\" in the room next door to where he plays in high-level tournaments for thousands of pounds in prize money.\nAnne said she dreams of being good enough to challenge her son in the battle arena but says it would be a mountain to climb.\n\"It would be super good if I could compete against him at a World Cup or something, but there is such a skill gap between the likes of Benjy and myself that I don't think I could ever quite make it to that level. But I'll try!\""

      "tags": "NI education,Contact tracing,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled to discuss the situation regarding Covid-19 in schools.\nThe speaker has decided that the recall, which follows a petition put forward by Sinn F\u00e9in, will take place on Thursday at 12:00 BST. \nSome principals have expressed concern that guidance on testing and tracing has caused a high number of pupils to miss classes.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan has suggested a quicker test could be used.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen said proposals for dealing with Covid school absences were being finalised, and would be discussed with the education sector this week. \nShe said discussions had been ongoing between her department and the Department of Health. \nAssembly members were officially due to resume assembly business on Monday.\nThe recall, proposed by Pat Sheehan MLA, needed 30 signatures to pass.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen needed to give \"clear guidance\" and put in place enough resources to support staff in keeping schools open, he said.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Givan, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) colleague of the minister, said the executive may need to consider other options for Covid-19 testing and contact tracing in schools.\nIt comes after more than half of the pupils at Larne High School were absent on Monday because they were in close contact with a positive case.\nThe current guidance issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) last month advised that close contacts of a positive case can avoid self-isolation if they had recently tested positive themselves and present no symptoms.\nOtherwise, if a pupil is a close contact and has no symptoms but has not had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the previous 90 days, they are advised to self-isolate until they have taken a test.\nMr Givan said this policy was supported by all the parties in the executive and should be followed, rather than children having to self-isolate for the previous requirement of 10 days.\nThe word that you hear a lot is \"unsustainable\". Principals are saying they can't go on like this. \nMichael Carville, who is head of Regent House, a secondary school in Newtownards with 1,400 pupils, said to me on Monday that he hasn't done any education since he got back to school at the start of term. It it has been all contact tracing.\nAnd a number of other heads [principals] are in the same position. \nWe are only just a week into term, and there is a recognition right across the board that it cannot go on like this. \nThe problem is, what do we do about it?\nAny major change in self-isolation rules would have to be approved by the executive.\nIt is hard to know if that would be palatable to the executive, or what other changes could be made without executive approval.  \nMr Givan conceded it was \"becoming difficult\" to find available slots for PCR tests and questioned if the education system should \"go back to a system of lateral flow testing\", which are not as accurate but provide quick results.\nHe told BBC News NI that such tests were considered sufficient for access to venues such as sporting events and could be \"carried out at home by parents\".\n\"Every option needs to now be considered because if the system within the Public Health Agency cannot support principals to implement a policy which was to prevent children being put out for 10 days and to have a turnaround of 24 hours, then we need to be considering other options,\" he said.\nBut St John the Baptist Primary School principal Chris Donnelly said lateral flow testing did not give the same security.\nTwo classes at the Finaghy school were sent home because of positive cases last week, he said. \nOver the weekend he asked parents to provide documentary proof of negative PCR tests. \nThe same documentary proof would not be available with a lateral flow test, he said. \nHe said he also had to stop two children from coming into school because they had not been tested.\n\"There's a trade-off in society at the moment. We know that opening the schools can only do one thing. It's only going to lead in an increase in the number of cases,\" he told BBC's Evening Extra programme. \n\"But we understand that society needs to function. If we're going to have that system in place then we need to trust that the system is robust.\n\"I do not think relying on lateral flow tests is robust, I don't think that it would provide the reassurance that parents, that staff members and school leaders need.\"\nBrain Guthrie, head teacher of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, said the first positive cases since the school year started were identified at the end of last week.\nHe told BBC Radio Foyle some of the messages coming from the PHA have been mixed.\n\"If a child tests positive here at Ebrington, having reported cases before I am feeling confident enough myself to get information out to parents. We have our letter ready to go, we adjust the date appropriately,\" he said.\n\"I then make the phone call through to PHA and make them aware of that. The only thing is, is the pressure of time, the amount of added administration that is putting on principals.\"\nLori Campbell, who is a mum of four and also works as a childminder in Londonderry, was instructed to take one her children home when she arrived at the school gates on Monday.\n\"Her class was involved in a close-contact situation and they needed us to return home and organise a PCR test,\" Mrs Campbell told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"It left me in a situation where I was meant to be working, I had another child on board who was then at risk and my husband was at work.\"\nShe said her daughter's Covid-19 test results came back negative.\n\"If her test had came up positive, I would have to close my business and that would be me closed until her PCR test came back clear,\" she said.\n\"That's not a great position to be in and not a great position to then land other parents in who have to come and pick up their child.\"\nMrs Campbell has called for the current testing and tracing protocols in schools to be changed.\nBBC News NI asked the Department of Education and Education Authority (EA) for figures for the number of pupils absent from class, but they directed us to the PHA.\nThe PHA directed us to a Covid-19 bulletin, which has not been updated since August 29.\nStormont education committee chair Chris Lyttle said he had requested that both the PHA and chief medical officer attend Wednesday's education committee meeting. \n\"We need greater clarity on what the evidence is behind the system we have in place, and whether the system is operating as it is supposed to,\" said the Alliance assembly member.\nSDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the lack of planning by the Department of Education had \"plunged schools into crisis\".\n\"I have been inundated by school principals complaining about the current guidance, it's not fit for purpose and resulted in them and their staff spending countless hours focused on contact tracing and other Covid-related issues instead of education,\" he said.\nFollowing the absence levels at Larne High School, the PHA set up a mobile testing facility at Larne Leisure Centre.\nThe real business on Thursday may not happen within the assembly chamber but at the executive meeting which is also due to take place.\nThe education and health ministers have been tasked by the executive to go off and listen to what's been said by teachers on the ground, to speak to public health officials and the chief medical officer.\nThey will come back to the executive on Thursday with some proposals as to how they may be able to tackle this current crisis.\nIt was anticipated there was going to be difficulties but ministers have now found themselves in the position where they are going to have to look again at this problem.\nPerhaps the scale of the problem that was coming down the track was underestimated.\nBehind the scenes, there is probably a lot of scrambling going on.\nOn Sunday, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said some schools had decided not to follow the PHA guidance because they feared it could lead to greater infection rates.\nThe union said some principals would like pupils to have longer self-isolation periods to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their classmates.\nThe first minister said he wanted the Department of Health to provide an update on the situation at Thursday's executive meeting.\nUp to 12,000 pupils are out of school in the Republic of Ireland, RT\u00c9 has reported.\nAbout 1,300 schools are reporting cases but the \"vast majority\" are traced to community transmission and not picked up in school, according to the Health Service Executive.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said \"we are seeing a large number of students having to self-isolate because they have been deemed to be close contacts and they of course will get tested\"."

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban,Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund",
      "text": "The Taliban have announced an interim government in Afghanistan, declaring the country an \"Islamic Emirate\". \nThe new cabinet, entirely male, is made up of senior Taliban figures some of whom are notorious for attacks on US forces over the last two decades.\nIt will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, one of the movement's founders, who is on a UN blacklist.\nThe interior minister is the feared FBI-wanted leader of the Haqqani militant group, Sirajuddin Haqqani.\nThe Taliban seized control of most of Afghanistan more than three weeks ago, ousting the previous elected leadership.\nThe announcement of the acting cabinet is a key step in the formation of a permanent Taliban government. The new leadership will face significant challenges, not least stabilising the country's economy and gaining international recognition.\nThe Taliban have previously said they wanted to form an inclusive government. However, all of the cabinet ministers announced on Tuesday are already established Taliban leaders, and no women were included.\nA statement attributed to Taliban Supreme Leader Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada told the government to uphold Sharia.\nThe Taliban want \"strong and healthy relations with our neighbours and all other countries based on mutual respect and interaction\", said the statement, released in English - with the caveat that they would respect international laws and treaties \"that are not in conflict with Islamic law and the country's national values\".\nHibatullah Akhundzada has never made a public appearance. This is the first message appearing to come from him since the Taliban took control last month.\nHassan Akhund, the new interim prime minister, served as deputy foreign minister from 1996 to 2001, when the group was last in power. He is influential on the religious side of the movement, rather than the military side.\nHis appointment is seen as a compromise, after recent reports of in-fighting between the some relatively moderate Taliban figures and their hardline colleagues.\nSirajuddin Haqqani, the new acting interior minister, is head of the militant group known as the Haqqani network who are affiliated with the Taliban and have been behind some of the deadliest attacks in the country's two-decade-long war - including a truck bomb explosion in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people.\nUnlike the wider Taliban, the Haqqani network has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. It also maintains close ties to al-Qaeda.\nAccording to the FBI's profile on Haqqani, he is \"wanted for questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul... that killed six people, including an American citizen\".\nIt adds: \"He is believed to have coordinated and participated in cross-border attacks against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Haqqani also allegedly was involved in the planning of the assassination attempt on [former] Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.\"\nThe Haqqani network has also been blamed for an attack on the US embassy and nearby Nato bases in Kabul on 12 September 2011. Eight people - four police officers and four civilians - were killed in that attack.\nA movement which has long moved in the shadows, whose names would surface only on the world's terrorism watch lists, is now announcing titles used in governments the world over. \nActing prime minister Mullah Akhund appears as a compromise candidate after reported rivalries among leading military and political figures who will serve under him. \nIts caretaker nature also provides breathing space as the Taliban move from guns to government. \nIt also underlines the Taliban view that a Taliban victory can only mean Taliban rule. Sources say they pushed back against calls for an \"inclusive\" government. They balked at including former political figures and officials, who've had their turn at the top, and especially those tainted by corruption. \n\"Why should we let others pick our cabinet when other countries pick their own? \"was one retort. \nAs for women, there was never a chance they would be given a ministerial role; the Ministry of Women's Affairs seems to have been, for now, abolished altogether.  \nOther appointments to the new government include:\nREAD MORE: Who's who in the Taliban leadership\nAsked why no women were given posts, one senior Taliban figure told the BBC that the cabinet had not been finalised yet.\nThe government announcement came on the day Taliban fighters fired shots at a protest of hundreds of people, mainly women, in Kabul.\nFootage from the scene showed people running to safety, while heavy gunfire - warning shots fired by militants - was heard in the background.\nThe Taliban now claim full control of Afghanistan, saying they have defeated resistance fighters who were holding out against them in the Panjshir valley, north of Kabul.\nThe National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF) said in a statement that it \"considers the announcement of the Taliban's caretaker cabinet illegal and a clear sign of the group's enmity with the Afghan people\"."

      "text": "The countries most vulnerable to climate change are calling for an \"emergency pact\" to tackle rising temperatures. \nThe group wants all countries to agree radical steps to avoid \"climate catastrophe\" at the upcoming COP26 meeting in Glasgow. \nGreen campaigners are urging a postponement of the gathering, citing problems with vaccines for delegates. \nThe Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) says the event is critical and cannot wait.\nRepresenting some 1.2 billion people, the CVF consists of countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. \nThe group has been key in pushing the rest of the world to accept the idea of keeping the rise in global temperatures to under 1.5C this century. \nThis was incorporated into the Paris agreement in 2015. \nRecent research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that the threshold will be passed in little over a decade at current rates of carbon emissions.\nIn less than two months, global leaders will gather in Glasgow for COP26, the most critical meeting on climate change since Paris.\nAhead of the Glasgow meeting, the CVF has issued a manifesto for what the conference must deliver to keep the planet safe and protect the most vulnerable. \nEnvironmental groups have suggested postponing the meeting, on the grounds that vaccine distribution is inequitable and that delegates from poorer countries face huge bills for quarantine hotels when they arrive in the UK.\nHowever, the CVF member states insist the meeting must go ahead in person, and are calling for support and \"facilitated access\" to ensure inclusive participation. \nThe UK government has responded to these calls by agreeing to pay the quarantine hotel expenses of any delegate, observer or media from a developing country.\nThe vulnerable group says that progress on climate change has stalled and COP26 should move forward with what it terms a \"climate emergency pact\".\nThis would see every country put forward a new climate plan every year between now and 2025.\nAt present, signatories of the Paris agreement are only obliged to put forward new plans every five years. \nThe vulnerable nations say that richer countries must fulfil their obligations to deliver $100bn in climate finance per year over the 2020-24 period. \nThe CVF nations want this money to be split 50-50 between cutting carbon and helping countries adapt to the threat posed by rising temperatures. \nThe countries also want the UK to \"take full responsibility\" for this aspect of the negotiations, saying it is vital to restore confidence in the Paris pact. \nAmong the other areas that the most vulnerable nations want to see progress on is the question of debt-for-climate swaps. \nMany of the world's poorest countries have large debt burdens, and these have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic which has stretched finances even further. \nIn a debt-for-climate swap, a country can reduce what it owes to international creditors by directing the debt service payments to fund renewable energy or greater protection for nature. \nOne such restructuring was recently announced by Belize where the debt money will now go to support marine conservation projects instead.\n\"Vulnerable countries have unique needs - and public-private collaboration will be key to addressing them,\" said Nigel Topping, who's the UK's high-level climate action champion for COP26.\n\"Whether it is in debt for nature swaps such as the recent Belize announcement or in increasing public sector capability to structure investment projects to attract private finance, the aim is to accelerate progress in this area so that 2022 becomes the year of climate action solidarity.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.

      "text": "The government is planning to overhaul the travel traffic light system, with changes set to be announced in weeks. \nGreen and amber categories could be removed and replaced with a new system, the BBC has been told.\nA new system would allow vaccinated travellers to go to countries with similarly high levels of vaccination as the UK without the need for quarantine.\nSources say the red category, which is for countries which the government says should not be visited, will remain.\nUnder current restrictions, red countries should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\" and travellers returning from them must self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel.\nThe government declined to comment on the plans but said: \"Our international travel policy is guided by one overwhelming priority - protecting public health. \n\"The next formal checkpoint review will take place by 1 October 2021.\"\nIt is understood that the government has asked senior travel industry leaders to make proposals for international travel to replace the current traffic light system. \nThe government devised the travel traffic light system to limit the transmission of Covid-19 from overseas and protect against new variants coming into the country.\nOne of the key demands from industry bosses is the removal of Covid testing as a necessity of travel back to the UK, which they say puts customers off booking due to cost.\nThis would bring the UK in line with much of European Union, which does not mandate Covid tests for vaccinated travellers within the bloc. It is unclear whether this will happen in the UK. \nTravel industry bosses believe it is crucial that the sector receives a boost of confidence to encourage travellers and holidaymakers to book and travel again. \nThey say the fear caused by category changes is a huge barrier to customers booking and the sector ultimately moving into recovery.\nSudden changes to the traffic light categories for Portugal and Mexico at the start of the summer saw holidaymakers having to rush home at short notice.  \nBosses also point to the \"damaging\" impact on business when commentators speculate on potential changes to countries moving on and off green, amber and red lists, which then prove to be incorrect when government decisions are officially released.\nThe Daily Telegraph first reported that the government was planning to scrap the traffic light system.\nThe third government review of international travel is due by 1 October, but sources say changes could come as soon as next week.\nTravel industry leaders want changes to happen as soon as possible, as the furlough scheme is due to end on 30 September and thousands of travel sector workers are still on the wage support scheme.\nA relaxation in travel rules, they believe, would lead to a bookings surge, which may protect the jobs of those currently on furlough. \nOne industry source said: \"Removing PCR testing for vaccinated passengers is essential. We have to align ourselves with what the rest of Europe are doing and stop being such an outlier. \nThey added that the sector now faces a \"perfect storm\": \"This summer should have been the big reopening of travel - like has happened domestically - but it wasn't because of the insistence on hugely complex and expensive tests.\"\nYesterday, the chief executive of British Airways, Sean Doyle, demanded that the Covid testing and quarantine system is changed, saying it is \"not fit for purpose and must be simplified\".  \nHe added: \"We had the traffic light system over the summer. There was some progress made, but I think it's not fit for purpose. It needs to be simplified and adapted in the same way that we see in Europe and in the US.\nIndustry leaders say they are aware any policy changes will not happen until proposals are signed off by the Chief Scientific Officer and the Health Secretary. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Decisions on our traffic light system are kept under regular review and are informed by the latest risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and wider public health factors.\""

      "text": "Archbishop Carl Bean, a former Motown singer best known for the 1977 gay liberation anthem I Was Born This Way, has died at the age of 77.\nFeaturing the lyrics \"I'm happy, I'm carefree, and I'm gay, I was born this way\", it was a disco hit in the US and inspired Lady Gaga's Born This Way.\nShe credited him as an inspiration, saying his song was \"like a sermon\".\nAt the height of his music career, Bean worked with Dionne Warwick, Sammy Davis Jr, Burt Bacharach and Miles Davis.\nBut he turned down the offer of more work at Motown when they asked him to sing more commercially-viable love songs about women. \nInstead, he went on to become an Aids activist and founded a network of LGBT churches.\n\"Archbishop Bean worked tirelessly for the liberation of the underserved and for LGBTQ people of faith and in doing so, helped many around the world find their way back to spirituality and religion,\" the Unity Fellowship Church Movement said in a statement.\nIt said he had made the \"transition to eternal life\" on 7 September \"after a lengthy illness\".\nBorn in Baltimore in 1944, Bean was raised by his next-door neighbours after his mother died during an abortion. \nHe was actively involved in the church and the black civil rights movement from a young age, with the two often intertwining.\n\"I was introduced to Jesus as a rabble rouser who made things happen,\" he later recalled. The image of Jesus as an outsider, who embraced people from all walks of life, inspired him and taught him an early lesson about acceptance.\nAs a teenager, he found himself attracted to boys in the neighbourhood, and also alleged that an \"uncle\" - the brother of one of his guardians - sexually abused him.\nBoth revelations emerged at the same time and, in the ensuing turmoil, the family kicked him out.\n\"Being basically a foster child, I felt like, now I'ma be kicked out because I'm a queer,\" he told Vice in 2016. \"I attempted suicide and landed in the mental health ward of a big hospital.\"\nThe hospital insisted on treating him with electroshock therapy, but Bean found an ally in a German psychiatrist who helped him come to terms with his sexuality.\n\"She said, 'There are many people like you. I can't do what your parents want - make you a heterosexual - but I can help you accept who you are and go for your dreams,'\" he recalled.\n\"That gave me enlightenment and the chance to accept myself. If I had another doctor, I might have been a different animal.\"\nMusic was a solace for Bean and, after being released from hospital, he started performing gospel songs around Baltimore.\nAt 16, he moved to New York, where he became involved in the rich culture of the Harlem churches, and appeared in an early production of Langston Hughes's influential show Black Nativity.\nAfter another move to Los Angeles, he formed the group Carl Bean and Universal Love. But the band faltered because, in his words, they were too far \"ahead of the curve\".\n\"I was part of a movement looking to erase the line between R&B and gospel,\" Bean later explained in his autobiography.\nHowever, the band's 1974 single Gotta Be Some Change caught the ears of producers at Motown Records, who asked him to record a song written by Bunny Jones, I Was Born This Way.\nLabel owner Berry Gordy thought Bean \"would be perfect\" for the track, sister and fellow Motown executive Gwen Gordy later recalled. \"It's a message song with a gospel feel. [Berry said] Bean will tear it up.\" \nAlthough the lyrics were unconventional at the time - arriving before the Village People made an explicit connection between disco and homosexuality - Bean felt the song was a perfect fit.\n\"I always say the lyric found me, and it was very natural,\" he told US radio station NPR in 2019.\nAlthough the song had already been released a year earlier by recording artist Valentino, Bean's version became the definitive take, reaching number 15 on the US dance charts in 1978.\nAfter turning down a Motown career, he turned his attention back to the church and was ordained in 1982. That year, he also founded the Unity Fellowship of Christ Church for black LGBT congregants, whose motto is: \"God is love and love is for everyone.\"\nBefore long, he was asked to help establish similar congregations around the US and Caribbean.\n\"I told them, 'If you can get 10 black gay men and lesbians together, who aren't afraid to be out, I will come and talk.' So I went to many cities for many years, and only went back to LA around 1995,\" he told Out Alliance.\nBean also founded the Minority Aids Project in 1985, which was the first community organisation to focus on the spread of Aids in the black community at a time when the disease was relatively new and misunderstood.\nHe was honoured many times for his work, receiving an NAACP Image Award in 1987, and having an intersection in Los Angeles named in his honour two years ago. \nI Was Born This Way remained an important anthem for the gay community and gained a new lease of life in 2011 when Lady Gaga used it as the foundation for her own hymn to acceptance, Born This Way.\n\"I heard this song. And I just said, 'Man, does that answer every question'.\" the star once told radio host Howard Stern.\nBean said he was honoured and flattered that Gaga had referenced his biggest hit.\n\"I felt it was a great tribute, and it was the continuation of saving lives,\" he said. \n\"So you know, [I Was Born This Way] has just been a blessing to my life. And it's been a blessing, once again, to even another generation's life through the take that Gaga did on it.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nadhim Zahawi,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government has denied newspaper reports that it is planning an October lockdown in England.\nThe i newspaper said plans had been drawn up to extend the school half-term holiday, if the number of hospitalisations continue at the current level.\nThe i said a full lockdown was unlikely - but the government could introduce some rules as part of a \"firebreak\".\nHowever the Department for Education said the report was \"not true\".\n\"It is not true that the government is planning a lockdown or firebreak around the October half term,\" it said in a tweet.\nThe prime minister's spokesman also denied the report. He said plans had been kept for a range of scenarios - \"but these kind of measures would only be reintroduced as a last resort to prevent unsustainable pressure on our NHS\".\n\"I think we've been clear throughout that we will take action, and indeed we have done when necessary to protect our NHS,\" he said.\nBut the spokesman pointed out that when rules were brought in the past, the UK did not yet have the protection from vaccines. \nOn Tuesday the UK recorded another 37,489 coronavirus cases, with 209 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nFour in five people in the UK aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the latest figures show. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was \"a phenomenal achievement\".\nIf the NHS was at risk of collapse the return of restrictions is possible. Contingency plans are, of course, in place. \nBut the key question is - what is the likelihood of this? Very few of those scientists advising government think it's a likely scenario. \nAnd - as one scientist put it to me - \"if we were going to suggest anything it wouldn't be closing schools\".\nThat's not to say there isn't real concern about winter. \nCovid, plus the return of normal winter viruses made worse by lack of immunity from social distancing and lockdown last year, means the coming months are likely to be very difficult for the NHS. \nCare could be rationed and performance deteriorate as happens quite often in winter.\nBut it is important to remember currently fewer than 7% of beds are occupied by Covid patients - and the numbers are not rising rapidly.\nEarlier, the government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped booster jabs would avoid the need for any new lockdown rules.\n\"Look, vaccines have given us the ability to reduce infections, to save 100,000 lives,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"I'm not going to be arrogant and say to you this is a done deal, it's all over, it's fine, this virus is no longer in pandemic stage. \n\"But I hope through the booster programme we can transition the virus from pandemic to endemic status and deal with it year in, year out... but not have to close down our economy or take the severe measures we had to sadly take in December of last year.\"\nThe first booster vaccines for the most vulnerable are expected this month.\nThe latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the government on vaccines -  suggests more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose of Covid vaccine.\nThat number includes all over-50s and anyone over 16 who qualifies for a flu jab.\nSeparately to the booster jabs, about 400,000 to 500,000 people in the UK who are severely immuno-suppressed will also be eligible for a third dose of vaccine. This is different to a booster jab, and they may also get a booster at a later date.\nMr Zahawi also emphasised that the flu vaccine was important. \n\"I worry about flu,\" he said. \"We've got a big flu programme that has begun and will continue throughout the winter months as well as, I hope, our Covid booster programme which will begin shortly this month.\"\nThe number of people in hospital with coronavirus has been slowly climbing in recent weeks - although it is still far below the peak in January this year.\nSo far, nearly 80% of adults in the UK are fully vaccinated, while almost 89% have had a first dose.

He died at the scene.\nThe curve of the track meant the passenger was difficult to detect on the drivers' CCTV, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found.\nIt happened on the Bakerloo line at Waterloo station in May 2020. \nThe RAIB has made several safety recommendations to London Underground.\nThe accident, which happened mid-morning during the first coronavirus lockdown, took place when there were no staff or other passengers to help. When the man was unable to free himself the train left with him still in the gap, crushing him as it moved off. \nHe had been trapped for more than a minute before the train departed. Only his head and arm had been above platform level, and so the passenger was difficult to detect using monitors.\nHe then lay motionless for a further minute and a half before being hit by the second train as it entered the station, the report said.\nThe driver of that train was unaware of the passenger because their attention was focused on the platform and the train's stopping point, the report said.\nThe RAIB found that London Underground's risk assessments did not identify extra risks caused by curved platforms at certain stops.\nThe investigation found that the model used by London Underground to assess safety issues relating to what the RAIB calls the \"platform-train interface\" did not take into account non-fatal injuries. Therefore,  the model understated the risk to passengers in such scenarios and presented an \"incomplete picture\" of it. \nThe three recommendations made by the branch:"

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus testing,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is planning to overhaul the travel traffic light system, with changes set to be announced in weeks. \nGreen and amber categories could be removed and replaced with a new system, the BBC has been told.\nA new system would allow vaccinated travellers to go to countries with similarly high levels of vaccination as the UK without the need for quarantine.\nSources say the red category, which is for countries which the government says should not be visited, will remain.\nUnder current restrictions, red countries should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\" and travellers returning from them must self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel.\nThe government declined to comment on the plans but said: \"Our international travel policy is guided by one overwhelming priority - protecting public health. \n\"The next formal checkpoint review will take place by 1 October 2021.\"\nIt is understood that the government has asked senior travel industry leaders to make proposals for international travel to replace the current traffic light system. \nThe government devised the travel traffic light system to limit the transmission of Covid-19 from overseas and protect against new variants coming into the country.\nOne of the key demands from industry bosses is the removal of Covid testing as a necessity of travel back to the UK, which they say puts customers off booking due to cost.\nThis would bring the UK in line with much of European Union, which does not mandate Covid tests for vaccinated travellers within the bloc. It is unclear whether this will happen in the UK. \nTravel industry bosses believe it is crucial that the sector receives a boost of confidence to encourage travellers and holidaymakers to book and travel again. \nThey say the fear caused by category changes is a huge barrier to customers booking and the sector ultimately moving into recovery.\nSudden changes to the traffic light categories for Portugal and Mexico at the start of the summer saw holidaymakers having to rush home at short notice.  \nBosses also point to the \"damaging\" impact on business when commentators speculate on potential changes to countries moving on and off green, amber and red lists, which then prove to be incorrect when government decisions are officially released.\nThe Daily Telegraph first reported that the government was planning to scrap the traffic light system.\nThe third government review of international travel is due by 1 October, but sources say changes could come as soon as next week.\nTravel industry leaders want changes to happen as soon as possible, as the furlough scheme is due to end on 30 September and thousands of travel sector workers are still on the wage support scheme.\nA relaxation in travel rules, they believe, would lead to a bookings surge, which may protect the jobs of those currently on furlough. \nOne industry source said: \"Removing PCR testing for vaccinated passengers is essential. We have to align ourselves with what the rest of Europe are doing and stop being such an outlier. \nThey added that the sector now faces a \"perfect storm\": \"This summer should have been the big reopening of travel - like has happened domestically - but it wasn't because of the insistence on hugely complex and expensive tests.\"\nYesterday, the chief executive of British Airways, Sean Doyle, demanded that the Covid testing and quarantine system is changed, saying it is \"not fit for purpose and must be simplified\".  \nHe added: \"We had the traffic light system over the summer. There was some progress made, but I think it's not fit for purpose. It needs to be simplified and adapted in the same way that we see in Europe and in the US.\nIndustry leaders say they are aware any policy changes will not happen until proposals are signed off by the Chief Scientific Officer and the Health Secretary. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Decisions on our traffic light system are kept under regular review and are informed by the latest risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and wider public health factors.\""

      "tags": "Holyhead,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A care home owner has said she was \"forced\" to ask two staff with Covid-19 to work because of a staff shortage.\nThe Caledonia home in Holyhead, Anglesey, said 11 of its 12 residents had Covid and the two staff only cared for residents who were also positive.\nAnn Bedford said Anglesey council and an agency had both been unable to provide emergency cover for staff who were sick or isolating.\nAfter speaking to social services, it was agreed the staff could work.\nAnglesey council said it worked closely with the care home since the staffing shortages had been brought to its attention.\nMs Bedford has run the home, which specialises in dementia care, since 1987 and said it had been increasingly difficult to recruit staff over the past decade. The situation now has \"no spare capacity in the system\", she said.\nThere are usually between 13 and 15 staff including a manager, two full-time carers, 11 part-time staff, two cooks and two cleaners at the home.\nLast weekend there were only three day staff, no cleaners, one cook and no night staff.\nThe two Covid-positive staff came in to cover the night shift.\nBy Wednesday morning, Ms Bedford had one person to work with the 12 residents.\n\"I have never known a situation as bad as we faced over the last weekend. As a matter of course we have contingency plans in place to cope in emergencies but even these buckled under the strain,\" she said. \n\"My heart sinks when I think about the weeks and months ahead.\n\"We felt abandoned and alone. I called on social services for help but they were facing their own emergencies.\n\"The shortage of carers on Anglesey is at dangerous levels and is being intensified by the pandemic.\"\nOne care agency which she asked to help with temporary staff told her \"you must be joking\", saying they were overwhelmed with requests.\nMs Bedford said after speaking to social services and the Care Council of Wales, it was agreed if staff felt well enough they could come in to work.\nShe praised the two staff who volunteered to come in, adding: \"The night shift is tough and extremely tiring. It really knocked them for six and both these staff are now suffering much more from the symptomatic effects of Covid.\n\"I am so grateful to them but this is a situation which should not have been allowed to happen.\"\nShe said the authorities had suggested transferring staff from another home she runs nearby, Plas Dyffryn, but she said it would have put staff and residents there at increased risk and was not an option.\n\"It is also not feasible because we simply do not have enough care staff on our books to stretch that thinly, and the Caledonia is specialised for dementia care so staff here need to be trained in those highly specific skills,\" she added.\nShe described staff as worn out and \"on their knees\" from the pandemic and the lack of personnel available to work.\n\"What's happened to me is frightening everybody (other care home managers) - we fought so hard and kept Covid out of the homes, but a lot of homes have got it,\" she said.\nAnglesey council said in a statement: \"Decisions in respect of emergency care provision at the Caledonia have been taken in the best interest of residents.\n\"We would reject claims that this private care home was abandoned. Our officers, together with colleagues in health, have worked very closely with Ms Bedford to respond to her staffing shortages since this issue was brought to our attention.\"\nA spokesman said they had worked to identify shift cover until the weekend to ensure residents did not have to leave their home.\nA team has also been convened to manage the incident at the home.\nThe crisis rose just before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday National Insurance contributions would rise to fund social care and NHS reforms.\nIn Wales, a proportion of the funds raised at a UK level will be allocated to spend on health and care services, expected to be about \u00a3700m by 2024-25.\nThe Welsh government said: \"We know the sector is under exceptional pressure but we are very concerned to hear a report of staff being asked to work despite testing positive for Covid. We are looking into the circumstances as a matter of urgency.\n\"We continue to support the sector at this difficult time and have provided local authorities with \u00a350m of additional funding to help deal with these staffing challenges.\""

There have been 21 deaths in the past seven days, meaning 5,712 people in Wales have died with Covid-19.\nThe number of people in Wales vaccinated with the first dose has risen to 2,363,623 (74.53% of the total population), while 2,194,075 (69.2%) have been fully vaccinated."

      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger has rejected claims that she went back on a deal to perform in a reunion tour, branding them \"ludicrous and false\".\nThe singer is being sued by the band's choreographer and founder Robin Antin for allegedly reneging on a previously-announced tour, it emerged this week.\nBut Scherzinger's lawyer has now said any such obligations \"simply do not exist\".\nHoward King called the legal case \"a desperate attempt to divert blame\".\n\"Robin will fail in her efforts to trade on Nicole's hard-earned success to pull herself out of a deep financial hole she has created by her own poor business and professional decisions,\" Mr King said in a statement given to the BBC.\n\"Nicole loves and respects the PCD fans and hopes to one day be back on stage performing the group's amazing hits for them... Sadly, this will not happen under these circumstances.\"\nAccording to legal papers filed by Antin, Scherzinger asked to renegotiate the reunion agreement to give her creative control and a larger share in the group's new business venture.\nIn November 2019, a decade after the Pussycat Dolls split, the group announced they would reform for a live tour.\nFive of the six Dolls would reunite - with Scherzinger joined by Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar, Kimberly Wyatt and Jessica Sutta to perform hits like Buttonz, Don't Cha and Jai Ho at a series of live UK shows.\nCourt papers show that Scherzinger agreed to be an \"active partner\" in the tour, which included making up to 45 live appearances with the group.\nThe lawsuit, filed on Friday at Los Angeles Superior Court, includes a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), a short-form agreement drawn up and signed in advance of the tour's announcement.\nThe MoU shows that Roberts, Wyatt and Sutta would each receive 12.5% of net profits from the tour.\nAntin, who is described as the \"chief executive officer, director and sole owner of PCD\" would also receive 12.5%.\nBachar, who left the group in 2008 before their second album was released but was set to return for the reunion, would receive 5% of the takings.\nAs the lead singer and face of the recording group, Scherzinger stood to make the most, with a 32.5% share. \nHowever, the Covid-19 pandemic struck before the tour could take place, and the band announced they would reschedule the live dates in the future, when it was safe to do so. \nIn addition to her earnings from the tour, Scherzinger would be given a 49% stake in a new Pussycat Dolls business venture called PCD Worldwide, while Antin had a 51% share.\nScherzinger was awarded her share of the company in exchange for her participation in the reunion tour.\nThe court papers indicate that PCD Worldwide would manage the Pussycat Dolls brand in the future, including any new projects, such as putting together a \"new generation\" of Pussycat Dolls.\nThe court papers say Scherzinger initially agreed to the 49% share in PCD Worldwide in 2019, but allegedly later said she wanted to increase that to 75%. \nAccording to the papers, Scherzinger emailed to Antin in April 2021 saying she would refuse to take part in the reunion tour unless the contracts were renegotiated to increase her share in the company.\nScherzinger cited the \"growth of her personal brand\" and the \"opportunities she would have to forego to continue to engage in the partnership\" with Antin and the band as her reason for demanding a bigger share.\nThe lead singer is the biggest breakout star of the group. Scherzinger enjoyed a successful solo career in the early 2010s, starred in West End shows, and became a judge on TV competitions including The X Factor and The Masked Singer USA.\nAntin refused to meet this demand, which the lawsuit describes as \"extortion\", saying Scherzinger was already contractually obliged to take part in the reunion tour under the MoU she had signed two years earlier.\nThe stand-off has prevented the Pussycat Dolls reunion tour dates from being rescheduled, which will cost the band financially unless a solution is found.\nThe documents show Live Nation invested $600,000 (\u00a3434,000) to partner with the group in advance of the reunion, which the tour company will demand is returned if the concerts do not go ahead.\nIn his statement in response to the legal action, Scherzinger's lawyer said: \"Prior to Nicole's involvement, trading on Nicole's name without her consent, Robin borrowed (and spent) $600,000 from Live Nation that she won't or can't repay.\n\"Nicole has invested her own funds in excess of $150,000 in support of a potential PCD reunion that has now been made impossible by Robin's actions (including the public release of the group members' confidential financial information).\" "

Much will depend on your individual circumstances, but there are a number of reasons it's not necessarily the silver bullet it may first appear. \nThe cap on care is just that - a limit on how much you pay for care.\nThere was no mention of it in the 33-page plan published - but the government confirmed to BBC News the daily living costs in a care home - those associated with food, energy bills and the accommodation - will not count towards the cap.\nThe government has not said how much people should be prepared to contribute for these daily living costs - care homes do not usually itemise them.\nBut previous incarnations of the cap - the coalition government first considered it - suggested people's contribution to these living costs should be fixed at \u00a312,000 a year.\nThat would mean when someone hits the cap they could still face \u00a31,000 monthly bills for living costs.\nIn many ways, this is understandable - after all, they would be liable for living costs if they remained in their own home.\nBut it would mean - based on the average care home cost of \u00a336,000 a year - only \u00a324,000 of the spending counting towards the cap once those \u00a312,000 living costs are taken off.\nThat would mean it would take the average care home resident more than three and a half years to hit it.\nBut the problem is not many people live that long once they move into a care home. \nHalf die in little over a year, with three-quarters not making it past three years.\nCare you receive in your own home will count towards the cap. \nBut this tends to cost much less and therefore people would normally need to be in receipt of that care for many, many years to hit the cap.\nWhat is more, spending on care will count towards the cap only for people assessed by the local council as in need enough to be eligible. \nOnly the very frailest qualify.\nAnd more than half requests are turned down - with the County Councils Network predicting this will not change significantly with the changes announced.\nThe only way to widen access would be spending more on services - it has been increasingly squeezed in recent years.\nBut councils worry the money being raised by the National Insurance hike will be largely swallowed up covering the cost of the cap and funding the NHS - a warning that has also been reiterated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its analysis of the tax rise.\nIf these fears are realised, it would mean the system remains on its knees with insufficient staff to provide the care people need, council leaders are warning. \nAnd it is why, according to Natasha Curry, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, the changes risk leaving the public and care system \"short-changed\", despite the eye-catching announcements.\nMinisters may certainly be able to claim they are the first government in more than 20 years not to have dodged the issue - but fixing the problem is another matter.\nFollow Nick on Twitter.\nRead more from Nick.\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

      "text": "Major proposals to change Wales' Westminster constituencies have been published, as the number of Welsh MPs drops from 40 to 32. \nArfon, which covers part of Gwynedd, could go and the number of north-east Wales MPs could drop from six to four.\nWelsh Secretary Simon Hart could face a battle for his seat as Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire is redrawn.\nThe Boundary Commission for Wales' initial plans now enter an eight-week public consultation.\nThere will be two more separate consultations before final proposals are presented to MPs, with the final changes due to take effect at the next general election.\nPlans to redraw the Parliamentary boundaries date back around a decade, when David Cameron was prime minister.\nThe Boundary Commission has no power to set the number of MPs - which has already been decided by Parliament - and will not consider arguments around the number of constituencies.\nUnder new Westminster rules each constituency proposed by the Boundary Commission for Wales must contain between 69,724 and 77,062 registered voters. \nThe UK government says this will ensure people from all parts of the United Kingdom have equal representation in Parliament.\nThe only exception to that rule will be Ynys M\u00f4n, which was given a \"protected status\" last year, meaning no changes to the Anglesey seat's name or boundaries - leaving it with 52,415 voters.\nEvery other constituency in Wales will see changes, with the majority changing names and some disappearing entirely by being absorbed into neighbouring constituencies.\nOne of the constituencies affected will be Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, the seat held by UK government cabinet member Mr Hart. \nThe constituency, which has 58,048 registered voters, would be redrawn to include parts of the Preseli Pembrokeshire seat held by former Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb and would be rebranded Mid and South Pembrokeshire, along with a new Ceredigion Preseli seat.\nSpeaking to journalists on Wednesday, Mr Hart said the boundary redrawing process had \"years to run yet\". \n\"This is the implementation of a manifesto commitment to make the parliamentary boundaries in Wales fairer for voters,\" he said.\n\"It's not about career prospects of individual MPs or good fortune for particular political parties, this is making sure that every vote in Wales is of the same value.\"\nThe former \"red wall\" seats of north-east Wales could also face cuts, with Clwyd South and Vale of Clwyd disappearing.\nClwyd South, a Conservative gain from Labour in the 2019 general election, would being split between Alyn and Deeside, Wrexham and a newly-named Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr constituency. \nAnother Tory gain in 2019, Vale of Clwyd, would also be absorbed by Clwyd and Delyn.\nArfon, which has 43,215 voters, will be split between Dwyfor Meirionydd and Aberconwy - with Caernarfon in the former and Bangor in the latter.\nThe Bridgend seat, another Conservative gain at the last election, would be split between a new constituency called Aberafan Porthcawl and a new Bridgend seat that would include parts of the current Ogmore constituency.\nThe Boundary Commission said it considered several factors in developing its proposals, from geography to local and historical ties, as well as the required number of voters.\nSecretary to the Boundary Commission for Wales Shereen Williams said: \"We've had to propose significant changes due to the reduction in the number of Welsh constituencies and that's presented a particular challenge as we seek to develop a map which meets the conditions laid out in the (Parliamentary Constituencies) Act, but also meets the expectations of the people of Wales.\n\"We're confident that our proposals are a strong first attempt to create a workable map of 32 Welsh constituencies. \n\"The purpose of our initial proposals, however, is to start the conversation about how the new map will look.\"\nLiz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said she thinks the move is \"yet another argument that Wales should be taking over [its] own affairs\".\n\"We just lose our voice,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, adding she feared the proposals would make it even harder for MPs to serve their constituents. \n\"There are certain areas in here as [the map] stands that are so huge. If you live in certain parts of Wales you should be asking yourself: 'Am I getting fair service from my MP when I need them?'\"\nMeanwhile, Labour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant said \"it is a deliberate campaign by the Conservatives\" to get people who typically vote against them to vote for them.\nMr Bryant also criticised the UK government's proposal to pass a law requiring people to show an approved form of identification in order to vote. \n\"Many people in my constituency and people who live in transient communities in cities who normally tend to vote labour are going to find it more difficult to register, vote and participate in democracy\", he added.\nBut according to Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, \"it's no longer clear whether the Conservatives will necessarily lose significantly less than Labour\" in Wales after proposed boundary reform."

      "text": "Boeing's board of directors must face a lawsuit from shareholders over two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max plane, a US judge has ruled. \nMorgan Zurn said the first crash was a \"red flag\" about a key safety system on the aircraft \"that the board should have heeded but instead ignored\".\nShe said the real victims were the dead and their families but investors had also lost billions of dollars.\nBoeing said it would \"consider next steps\".\nIn her ruling the Delaware judge said: \"While it may seem callous in the face of [the families'] losses, corporate law recognizes another set of victims: Boeing as an enterprise, and its stockholders. \n\"Stockholders have come to this court claiming Boeing's directors and officers failed them in overseeing mission-critical airplane safety to protect enterprise and stockholder value.\" \nThe crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 killed all 346 people on board, leading to the 737 Max being grounded around the world. \nInvestigations later found a flaw in an automated flight control system, known as MCAS, was at fault. \nIn January, Boeing paid $2.5bn to settle criminal charges it concealed information about changes to MCAS from safety officials, contributing to the crashes. \nBut it still faces civil lawsuits from families along with the latest action from shareholders. \nOn Tuesday, Vice Chancellor Zurn dismissed some of the investors' claims, including one regarding a decision to award former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg a $60m retirement package after he was fired. \nHowever, the judge said another claim about board member oversight could go ahead. Shares in the plane maker slumped following the accidents and are yet to fully recover.\nA Boeing spokesperson said: \"We are disappointed in the court's decision to allow the plaintiffs' case to proceed past this preliminary stage of litigation.\n\"We will review the opinion closely over the coming days as we consider next steps.\"\nThe Max was cleared to fly in the US in November 2020, and in Europe and Canada in January this year. It remains grounded in China. \nThe crashes have already cost Boeing about $20bn in fines, cancelled orders and other costs. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe government is planning to overhaul the UK's travel traffic light system, with changes set to be announced in weeks. Green and amber categories could be removed and replaced with a new scheme which would allow vaccinated travellers to go to countries with similarly high levels of vaccination as the UK without the need for quarantine, the BBC has been told. Sources say the red category - for countries the government says should not be visited - will remain. Here's a reminder of what the traffic light system means.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the rate at which Covid-19 is spreading in Scotland may now be slowing down, although she said there continued to be a \"very high\" level of infection among the Scottish population. She told MSPs that average daily case numbers had gone up by 9% over the past week - but this was down significantly on the 70% increase seen the week before. She added that she was hopeful \"we can turn the corner\" without having to reintroduce any tighter restrictions.\nMoving too quickly to give people Covid booster jabs would deprive scientists of data on how well the vaccines work, AstraZeneca bosses have said. \"We do not yet know whether that third dose is clinically needed,\" they said in the Telegraph. It has already been announced that half a million of the most vulnerable in the UK will be offered a third dose. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday he was \"confident\" a booster programme could begin this month but was awaiting advice on who should be eligible. Find out more about who will get a booster jab here.\nPeople in northern England were 17% more likely to die with Covid than the rest of the country, official figures have revealed. A report by the Northern Health Science Alliance also found northerners had a 26% higher mortality rate in care homes than elsewhere in England.  Academics, who analysed government statistics, said the pandemic exacerbated inequalities in northern England, compared to the rest of the country in health and wealth.\nThe upcoming Ashes series between England and Australia's cricketers will \"hopefully\" be played in front of full crowds despite a rise in Covid-19 cases, Cricket Australia has said. Citing rising vaccination rates in Australia, chief executive Nick Hockley said he was optimistic the series would be played as scheduled and with fans present. The series is set to start in Brisbane on 8 December. The optimism comes despite parts of Australia currently being under lockdown, including Melbourne and Sydney, the venues for the third and fourth Tests in the five-match series.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nVaccination rates around the world continue to differ vastly - head here to find out how progress is going in different parts of the globe.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Dementia,Social care,NHS",
      "text": "For thousands of people who need social care, raising the money to pay for it has meant taking life-changing decisions. Many have sold their homes, while others have given up work to look after their loved-ones themselves. \nNow the government is raising taxes and proposing a cap on the amount people will pay. So what do those already using the care system make of the proposals? \nBetty, 88, has dementia and has lived in a care home since December 2016. She has sold her house to cover the tens of thousands of pounds needed to pay for her care. \nBut as she is already in a home, she will not benefit from the government's plans to cap costs at \u00a386,000. It will come into force in England from October 2023, but it will not be backdated.\nBetty's son, Gordon Brooks, from Gosport, Hampshire, describes his mother's \u00a34,300-a-month fees as \"horrendous\". To pay for them, her house was sold and the proceeds were invested in shares.\nBut Gordon fears that rather than being helped by the government's new plans, the money set aside to pay for her care will be hit by further taxation. \nAs part of the proposals, shareholders will also have to pay the additional 1.25% in tax on the profits they make.\n\"We invested it to gain more and make it last longer but if the investment is taxed further it diminishes it so it's a double whammy,\" he said.\n\"She's well looked after and in relatively good health but the assets she has will only last a certain amount of time.\"\nHe says his mother will be contributing to the new scheme through the additional tax from her shares, but won't gain anything herself.\n\"Politicians have been saying for a long time that people shouldn't have to sell houses to pay for their social care. She has already had to sell her house.\n\"This new scheme is meant to help people in this position but it's doing the opposite for her. I'm not interested in inheriting the family silver, I'm interested in making sure she is kept in the home and looked after.\"\nJulie, from Manchester, says her mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, will have paid a quarter of a million pounds in care home fees by the time the government's plans come into force in October 2023.\nShe rents out her mother's house to pay for her care but she says that only covers a quarter of the fees.\n\"In order to meet these costs, I will have to sell her property,\" she says. \"Her savings are all but depleted.\"\nJulie, an only child, says her mother is well looked after but she doesn't think it's fair that some people pay for care fees and others don't. \"\u00a3250,000 is a lot of money for just over four years of care,\" she adds.\nUnder the plans announced by the prime minister the NHS will get the bulk of the \u00a336bn raised in the first three years, with \u00a35.4bn going to social care in England.\nBut that balance is expected to tip towards social care in subsequent years as the \u00a386,000 cap on costs introduced from October 2023 starts to require funding.\nHowever, Julie says she is sceptical about how much of the money raised will end up going to social care. \"Whilst I welcome that finally, care home fees will be capped, waiting another two years in the hope that there will be funding available once monies have been ploughed into the NHS gives me very little comfort, or indeed hope, that this will actually come to fruition. \n\"I totally understand and appreciate that the NHS needs support, but so does social care. Why, yet again, is social care the poor relation?\"\nSharon and her family are struggling to pay for her elderly mother's care after the money put together from selling the family home ran out.\nShe says the money spent on her mother's care has gone well beyond the proposed cap.\nYou can watch her talking about her situation, below.\nSome carers who look after their family members feel they have been ignored by the government's proposals.\nNorman Couch lives in East Sussex where he cares for his mother after she had a series of strokes which left her with limited mental capacity and movement in just one arm. He gets help from a carer three times a day for half an hour.\n\"This policy will not help me or fund the little help I get from carers - either me or my mother will still pay for it.\"\nHe gave up his job to look after his mother and he says family carers are saving the NHS \u00a320,000 in looking after loved ones but \"we don't get the help\".\n\"It's a missed opportunity by the government - all they have done is kick the can down the road.\""

      "text": "MPs have voted 319 to 248 for a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance for workers and employers to help fund health and social care.\nBoris Johnson hopes the tax increase, which breaks a Conservative manifesto pledge, will raise \u00a312bn a year.\nThe prime minister said his plan would deal with \"catastrophic costs\" faced by those who need care.\nBut Labour raised concerns that people could still have to sell their home in order to pay for the help they need. \nDuring a House of Commons debate, some Conservative MPs also raised objections to the proposals.\nFormer minister Steve Baker called on his party to \"rediscover what it stands for\" rather than \"every time there is a squeeze on the public finances, coming back for higher taxes\".\nOpposition MPs voted against the rise but the government, which has a majority of more than 80, comfortably won the vote.\nFive Conservatives - Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Davies, Neil Hudson, Esther McVey and John Redwood - voted against the changes.\nThirty-seven Conservative MPs abstained. However, while some abstained due to concerns about the tax rise, others may simply been given permission to miss the vote. \nPoliticians have long agreed on the need to reform England's social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication.\nThe key proposals of the new plan are: \nCurrently workers pay 12% National Insurance on earnings between \u00a39,564 and \u00a350,268. However, anything earned above this amount attracts a rate of just 2%.\nMr Johnson has said the majority of the \u00a336bn fund raised by the tax rise will go towards catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid.\nA smaller portion of the money - \u00a35.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nThe UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional \u00a32.2bn to spend on their services. \nFrom 2023, the increase in National Insurance will become a separate levy, while the National Insurance rates will return to their previous level.\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said that under Mr Johnson's plan \"someone with a house worth \u00a3186,000 would still have to pay \u00a386,000 even with this cap - and that's before living costs of going into a care home.\"\n\"How does the chancellor suggest they pay those fees without selling their home?\" she asked.\nAlong with Labour, the SNP also voted against the government's proposals, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford accusing the Conservatives of \"taxing Scottish workers twice\" and \"forcing them to pay the bill for social care in England as well as at home in Scotland\".\nAnd Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister had failed to come up with a plan to tackle care staff vacancies or help unpaid family carers.\nConservative MP Jake Berry was among the critical voices from the government's own backbench, warning ministers that \"throwing other people's money down a bottomless pit doesn't become a good idea if you put the NHS logo next to it\".\nMr Johnson sought to reassure his own MPs ahead of the vote, telling a meeting of backbenchers: \"We should never forget we are the party of low taxation.\"\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

      "text": "A woman who was vaccinated in England and Scotland says she cannot get an accurate vaccination certificate because of issues with data-sharing across health services.\nMaura McGoldrick, 21, received her first dose in London and her second in Glasgow, where she lives.\nHowever, her vaccination record only shows her having received one dose.\nThe fourth-year student at the University of Edinburgh is concerned others may be similarly affected.\nThe Scottish government said it had been working to \"align\" vaccination data from across the UK.\nThe certificates are necessary for travelling abroad and could be used as part of a passport scheme to allow people into nightclubs and large events.\nScotland's system has already seen problems including a recent security glitch and people being denied use of the pass in certain countries.\nIt has only recently been made available in the form of a QR code - despite a digital passport being widely used across Europe for months.\nWhile travelling to London over the summer, Ms McGoldrick said she heard news of the push for young people to visit drop-in vaccine clinics - and attended a local clinic the following day.\nShe said the medics at the centre were unable to find her NHS records, but took her name and address and gave her a card which stated the batch of the vaccine she had just received.\nTo be safe, Ms McGoldrick said she quickly phoned NHS Inform to let them know she had received her first jab outside of Scotland and was told her records would be updated.\nHowever, when she received her second dose in Glasgow in August, she was told the first dose was missing from her medical records.\nShe requested her vaccine certificate by post and, again, the document showed one dose issued in Glasgow.\n\"Because there have been other things going on, it's just compounded general stress and been emotionally draining,\" said Ms McGoldrick.\n\"I know rationally it's not the end of the world and I'm very privileged even to just have the vaccine.\n\"But I'm now at the stage where there is no-one else for me to call, no more leads for me to pursue - it's a bit of a hopeless situation.\"\nMs McGoldrick has spent more than two weeks calling NHS Inform and her GP in order to resolve the matter.\nShe said her GP managed to acquire information on her vaccination in London.\nHowever, she said NHS Inform staff told her there was no data-sharing mechanism between them and NHS England and they would need to request the information from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\nThe Scottish government denied the claim about data sharing, saying it has worked to \"align\" vaccination records from different UK nations.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are aware some people have encountered problems but it's untrue to say there is no data-sharing and we are working closely with other nations to resolve the issue. \n\"We have a process in place for sharing data between England and Scotland and continue to work with international stakeholders to improve the transfer of data across borders.\n\"Updated NHS Inform guidance contains guidance on what to do if you have been vaccinated abroad or have been vaccinated in different parts of the UK.\"\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde gave the BBC contradictory information, saying that NHS Scotland certificates \"can only contain information on vaccines administered in Scotland\".\nIt has not responded to a further query.\nMs McGoldrick is currently trying to get the health board to share her GP's information with NHS Inform - but said other people in her position may not be able to chase it up.\nShe said: \"Selfishly speaking, I'm trying to sort this out for myself but I'm in the fortunate position where I have time to chase this up.\n\"But I know there are other people in the same position - NHS Inform said they had other people call about this but assumed they sorted it out. People have probably just given up as it will take more time and effort that they have to give right now.\"\nAs a result of her vaccine status issue, Ms McGoldrick has postponed her October plans to travel to Copenhagen - partly for leisure, but also to do work experience related to her university course in international relations.\nShe said she thought she was doing the right thing by getting her vaccine as quickly as possible, but the bureaucracy and cancelled plans that resulted had been a \"bit of a blow\".\n\"It's the fact that we've been cooped up for so long,\" she said. \"I felt when I got two doses I had done everything I was supposed to do.\""

      "text": "People who have lost thousands of pounds in the post-Grenfell fire safety crisis have asked for urgent help amid spiralling insurance and service costs.\nDeborah Polverino, from Cardiff, saw her annual service charge rise from \u00a33,000 to nearly \u00a37,800 after her building failed fire safety tests.\nCampaigners warned people could go bankrupt and lose their homes.\nThe Welsh government said it was \"working hard to develop funding options\".\nA spokesman said the \"complex nature\" of the issue was \"affecting the pace\" of that work. \nAs well as paying increased charges, many leaseholders are worried about the huge costs of repair work for things such as flammable cladding and inadequate internal firebreaks.\nIn July, the Welsh government announced it would be funding surveys to assess what work was required, a move described by campaigners as \"too little, too late\".\nA repair fund is planned for next year in Wales. In England people can already apply for money to remove cladding on buildings over 18m (59ft) tall.\nThe Welsh government is yet to spend any money on removing cladding or other fire safety remediation work on private residential buildings over 18m tall.\nIn response to a freedom of information request by BBC Wales, it said nearly \u00a311m had so far been spent on remedial work on 15 social housing blocks.\nWork has been completed on three buildings in Newport and is under way on one other in the city, eight in Cardiff and three in Swansea.\nMs Polverino has lived at Victoria Wharf in Cardiff Bay with her partner Guy Griffiths for 10 years.\nWhen they tried to move a couple of years ago they realised their seventh-floor, three-bedroom flat was \"valueless\".\n\"When you've invested a huge amount of money into your home and you're then told it's unsellable, or if you're lucky you might sell it at auction at a massively decreased value, it's a hard pill to take,\" said Ms Polverino.\n\"I can't mortgage it, I can't sell it.\"\nIncreased costs, including insurance and internal safety measures, have seen big hikes in the service charges leaseholders must pay.\n\"I sat down and cried, as I'm sure many people in these blocks did,\" she said.\nThe total cost of repair work, including the replacement of cladding, has been estimated at \u00a360,000 per flat, she said.\nAs well as the financial hit already taken and the worry about the bigger one potentially on the way, she is also anxious at the thought of a fire.\n\"I know so many people have sleepless nights over this. I've had my own sleepless nights.\n\"I even looked at getting one of these ladders but sadly they only go four floors, so that didn't help me.\"\nShe said the developer, Taylor Wimpey, should \"step up and do what's morally right\". \n\"We didn't build these properties, we didn't create the issue. Why are we paying for it?\"\nShe suggested the Welsh government could set up a low-interest loan scheme, similar to help it gave tenants during the pandemic.\nMs Polverino said First Minister Mark Drakeford and Housing Minister Julie James \"need to do more now\". \n\"We keep getting these promises of something in the future,\" she said.\n\"It's a moral obligation for the Welsh government to make sure leaseholders don't lose their homes.\"\nA spokesman for Taylor Wimpey said the company was \"taking steps where appropriate\" to help customers with fire safety measures and it had set funding aside to bring the external walls of its apartment buildings constructed over the past 20 years up to current standards.\n\"We are closely engaged with FirstPort, the management company at Victoria Wharf, regarding funding and further updates will be provided to residents as soon as possible.\"\nFirstPort said it was \"pleased\" Taylor Wimpey has \"announced additional funding\" and it was \"urgently reviewing\" what permanent work was required.\nBex Ashwin, from newly-formed campaign group Welsh Cladiators, said increased charges people were facing meant some would lose their homes or go bankrupt.\n\"The Welsh government really need to step up and understand the urgency of this situation and how much it is putting on residents every day from a mental health perspective.\" \nWelsh Conservative housing spokeswoman Janet Finch Saunders said homeowners in Wales had been left in the dark waiting for further news while costs spiralled. \n\"We urgently need action, with homeowners so far only seeing a paltry survey,\" she added. \n\"Welsh homeowners should not be left paying the price for the shortcomings of developers and it is the job of ministers to step in to rectify this injustice.\"\nPlaid Cymru claimed it was \"not acceptable\" the Welsh government had given no details about funding options and and urged it to address the matter, adding: \"How many more times will the pleas from these people, figuratively trapped in their high-rise buildings, fall on deaf ears?\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"These building defects are having a significant impact on leaseholders and residents. \n\"We are committed to supporting them and are working hard to develop funding options. \n\"Building safety issues are often more than just cladding-related - we are working hard to deliver a funding offer which will go further than cladding only.\""

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Tax,Boris Johnson,Social care,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has defended his plan to raise National Insurance to fund health and social care, saying it deals with \"catastrophic costs\" faced by millions.\nIn a testy exchange in Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed him on whether he stood by his promise that no one who needed care would have to sell their home.\nThe PM did not answer directly, saying his party was taking tough decisions. \nMPs are debating the plan in the Commons and will vote at 19:00 BST.\nIn the manifesto-breaking move, the prime minister hopes to raise \u00a312bn a year to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and boost social care.\nMr Johnson said his plan - which includes capping care costs in England at \u00a386,000 - was broad-based and progressive according to the economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\"The plan deals - after decades - with catastrophic costs faced by millions of people, the risks that they face, the threat they could face the loss of their homes, their possessions, their ability to pass on anything to their children,\" he said.\nHe added it was the first time the state had stepped in to deal with the threat of such costs and meant insurance companies would now be able to help protect people against the costs of care.\nBut Sir Keir said the tax was unfair on working people, adding: \"Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year.\n\"A care worker earning the minimum wage doesn't get a pay rise under this plan but does get a tax rise. In what world is that fair?\" \nLabour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, confirmed during the debate that the party would be voting against the tax. \nA handful of Conservative MPs are also expected to vote against, including former minister Steve Baker, who called on his party to \"rediscover what it stands for\" rather than \"every time there is a squeeze on the public finances, coming back for higher taxes.\"\nBut with an 80-seat majority, Mr Johnson's plan is still expected to pass. \nThe SNP also oppose the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a \"regressive tax\" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation.\nAnd Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also carer for his disabled son - said the plan \"forgot family carers\" who just want \"a fair deal\".\nIt is widely agreed that major changes are needed to England's social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out day-to-day tasks, such as washing, dressing, eating and medication.\nThe key proposals of the new plan are: \nMr Johnson has said the majority of the \u00a336bn fund raised by the tax rise will go towards catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations.\nA smaller portion of the money - \u00a35.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nBut there has been anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised.\nThe UK Home Care Association, which represents home care providers, said it was \"nowhere near enough\", while Unison, a union for care workers, said the money \"doesn't even come close\" and those in need of care would be feeling \"extremely let down\".\nChairman of the Independent Care Group Mike Padgham also said the plan did not address the staffing crisis which was \"sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts\".\nAsked about staff shortages and low pay, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the levy would mean local authorities could pay more for care and a new staff training and development programme would be introduced.\nFrom those who work in, commission services or have their lives shaped by the care they get, the reactions to the prime minister's plans to reform this crumbling system have been mixed. \nThe fact there is a plan is welcome because it means there is something to work with, but charities, councils and the people who run home care and care homes, are worried by the lack of a vision of what a future care system should be trying to achieve.\nAnd there is even more concern about the money. One senior local Conservative politician described the mood in local government to me in one word - \"despair\".\nCouncils are facing a significant increase in people asking for help already, but there is no extra money now. \nThere's scepticism about whether the funding given to the NHS in the short term will actually be released to social care in three years' time.\nThe politician said the authority feared that as the new levy comes in, their costs will go up as they expect more people will be eligible for council support (with more generous means-testing) and wage bills will rise for them and care providers.\nThey worry that people believe the social care system is fixed now, but the situation may have just got worse.\nThe new tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from next April, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip.\nThis will be paid by all working adults, including older workers. The government says it will be \"legally ring-fenced\" to go only towards health and social care costs.\nIncome from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase, to stop people getting round the tax by taking more earnings in the form of dividends rather than salary.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies also said the \u00a312bn a year extra for health and social care risked being swallowed up by the NHS.\nIt suggested that the experiences of the past 40 years showed NHS spending plans were almost always topped up, meaning that health would continue to require the bulk of the revenue raised by the new tax, which \"could leave little if any of the tax rises announced available for social care\".\nThe UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional \u00a32.2bn to spend on their services. \nMr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes but defended the move as \"the right, reasonable and fair approach\" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of \u00a3407bn on support.\nWhile he said he did not want to raise taxes further, he did not rule out more increases before the next election.\nSir Edward Leigh said as a \"low tax Conservative\" MP, it would be \"easy to attack\" the new levy, warning it could end up \"subsidising\" wealthy pensioners in the south east of England at the expense of those elsewhere. \nBut during Wednesday's debate, he said it was \"much more difficult to provide an alternative\" when the funding was needed for care and the NHS now.\nThe Tory backbencher did warn the leadership, however, not to think they can \"solve these problems by becoming a tax and spend party\" to cheers from his colleagues, adding: \"It is simply not going to wash\"."

      "title": "Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year",
      "text": "The government has confirmed a one-year suspension of the \"triple lock\" formula for annual state pension increases.\nThe move follows government concern that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have meant pensions increasing by 8%.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the average earnings component would be disregarded in the 2022-23 financial year.\nInstead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%.\n\"Tomorrow, I will introduce a Social Security Uprating and Benefits Bill for 2022-23 only,\" she told the Commons.\n\"It will ensure the basic and new state pensions increase by 2.5% or in line with inflation, which is expected to be the higher figure this year, and as happened last year, it will again set aside the earnings element for 2022-23 before being restored for the remainder of this Parliament.\" \nMs Coffey said the figures had been \"skewed and distorted\" by the average earnings rise, which she described as a \"statistical anomaly\".\nShe said the change meant that pensions would still rise, but less quickly. The triple lock would return the following year, she added. \nUnder the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater.\nThe Work and Pensions secretary said she was \"anticipating an unusual change in earnings\" due to the pandemic. \nShe added that earnings between May and July were expected to rise by more than 8%, so a one-year adjustment was needed. \nLast month, the Bank of England said it was expecting inflation to peak at 4%.\nThe Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to maintain the triple lock formula.\nMs Coffey's announcement came just hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson breached another manifesto commitment by increasing National Insurance to fund health and social care.\nAge UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \"If suspending the triple lock for a single year helps get a government deal on social care over the line, then I believe it's a price worth paying, but only if it really is just a one-off measure and not a sneaky way for ministers to ditch the triple lock altogether.\"\nMs Abrahams said that with more than two million pensioners currently living in poverty, there was \"a strong case\" for keeping the triple lock untouched.\nShe added that it was \"imperative that the triple lock reverts to normal next year, to help all those pensioners on low and modest incomes who desperately need it\".\nThe one-year break in the usual calculations for increases in the state pension was widely expected. \nThere is, after all, near-universal agreement that the average annual earnings rise (one leg of the so-called triple lock) will be an anomaly caused by the economic effect of Covid. \nCharities representing the elderly will hold the government to its commitment that this is just a temporary arrangement.\nTheir fear is that the government might be tempted to do the same again - potentially reducing rises in a state pension which is already low when compared with elsewhere in the Western world.\nOthers will consider this as a missed opportunity to reform the universal triple lock system, even though its existence is a Conservative manifesto promise for the rest of this Parliament.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of unvaccinated people ending up in hospital with Covid is \"concerning\", Boris Johnson has said.\nThree quarters of those admitted at hospitals such as St Thomas' had not had a Covid jab, with a \"higher proportion\" of younger people now being affected, he said.\nHe added that while lifting most restrictions in July continued to look right, there was still a risk as infections remained high. \nThe UK has reported more than 30,000 cases for the last nine days in a row.\nThe number of people in hospital with Covid is also rising. It currently stands at 7,907, compared to 5,697 a month ago.\nSpeaking at St Thomas' Hospital, London, the prime minister told the BBC: \"It'd be fair to say the decision to go ahead with the roadmap in the way that we did continues to look right. \n\"The openings that we did in July continue to look right - we're seeing the fastest growth of any G7 economy now we're comparatively open in this country. \n\"But we've got to be very clear with people. There still is a risk out there and there still is a pandemic, and the numbers of infections remain high or high-ish. \n\"I'm certainly concerned and what I'm particularly concerned about is that in great hospitals like this, 75% of the people who are succumbing to Covid still are not vaccinated.\"\nFour out of five people aged 16 and above have had two doses of a vaccine, while nearly 89% have had one dose.\n\"Sadly, we are seeing an increase in the proportion of Covid victims who are younger people,\" the prime minister said, urging those who were unvaccinated to get their jab.\n\"What we want to do is get people to see the value of vaccination to themselves and their families.\"\nWhat we are seeing with Covid is not a sudden surge like in previous waves, but a slow, gradual build-up of pressure.\nThe virus is not raging out of control, but it is still circulating and at quite a high level.\nThe vaccines are working really well.\nBut with one in five adults still not fully vaccinated, there are millions of people at risk. \nThat, as the prime ministers says, is the most significant cause of the pressure in hospitals.\nOnly around 7% of hospital beds are occupied by Covid patients, but if that keeps increasing along with the return of normal winter viruses, hospitals will have to start rationing other types of care more.\nIt's going to be a long, hard autumn and winter for the NHS.\nAsked about reports the government was planning of a \"firebreak\" lockdown in October, he said: \"There's been no discussion of anything like that.\"\nMr Johnson also reiterated the government's plan to offer a booster vaccine to the most vulnerable groups this month. \nIt had already been announced that half a million of the most vulnerable in the UK will be offered a third dose, following a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nAbout 400,000 to 500,000 people in the UK with severely weakened immune systems will be eligible for a third dose of vaccine.\nClarification 26th October 2021: In his interview with the BBC Boris Johnson highlighted that \"75% of the people who are succumbing to Covid still are not vaccinated,\" which we understood to be a comment on the general picture of hospital admissions, when addressing the state of the pandemic in the UK. His team later clarified that the figure of 75% related to \"major trusts like St Thomas' and so we have amended the article's second paragraph to precisely reflect that.\n"

      "title": "Will the cap really fix the social care system?",
      "text": "Ministers have announced a hike in national insurance to invest more in health and care.\nAs well as boosting NHS spending, the money will be used to pay for a cap on the costs people face if they need social care which includes help at home or a move into a care home.\nThe plan for England sounds simple - from 2023 no-one will pay more than \u00a386,000 for the care they need for daily tasks such as washing, dressing and eating.\nNo longer will people rack up \"catastrophic\" costs, the government says. \nBut as always the devil is in the detail. Much will depend on your individual circumstances, but there are a number of reasons it's not necessarily the silver bullet it may first appear. \nThe cap on care is just that - a limit on how much you pay for care.\nThere was no mention of it in the 33-page plan published - but the government confirmed to BBC News the daily living costs in a care home - those associated with food, energy bills and the accommodation - will not count towards the cap.\nThe government has not said how much people should be prepared to contribute for these daily living costs - care homes do not usually itemise them.\nBut previous incarnations of the cap - the coalition government first considered it - suggested people's contribution to these living costs should be fixed at \u00a312,000 a year.\nThat would mean when someone hits the cap they could still face \u00a31,000 monthly bills for living costs.\nIn many ways, this is understandable - after all, they would be liable for living costs if they remained in their own home.\nBut it would mean - based on the average care home cost of \u00a336,000 a year - only \u00a324,000 of the spending counting towards the cap once those \u00a312,000 living costs are taken off.\nThat would mean it would take the average care home resident more than three and a half years to hit it.\nBut the problem is not many people live that long once they move into a care home. \nHalf die in little over a year, with three-quarters not making it past three years.\nCare you receive in your own home will count towards the cap. \nBut this tends to cost much less and therefore people would normally need to be in receipt of that care for many, many years to hit the cap.\nWhat is more, spending on care will count towards the cap only for people assessed by the local council as in need enough to be eligible. \nOnly the very frailest qualify.\nAnd more than half requests are turned down - with the County Councils Network predicting this will not change significantly with the changes announced.\nThe only way to widen access would be spending more on services - it has been increasingly squeezed in recent years.\nBut councils worry the money being raised by the National Insurance hike will be largely swallowed up covering the cost of the cap and funding the NHS - a warning that has also been reiterated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its analysis of the tax rise.\nIf these fears are realised, it would mean the system remains on its knees with insufficient staff to provide the care people need, council leaders are warning. \nAnd it is why, according to Natasha Curry, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, the changes risk leaving the public and care system \"short-changed\", despite the eye-catching announcements.\nMinisters may certainly be able to claim they are the first government in more than 20 years not to have dodged the issue - but fixing the problem is another matter.\nFollow Nick on Twitter.\nRead more from Nick.\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

      "tags": "Tax,Boris Johnson,Social care",
      "text": "A new health and social care tax will be introduced across the UK to pay for reforms to the care sector and NHS funding in England.\nBoris Johnson said it would raise \u00a312bn a year, designed to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and to bolster social care.\nHe accepted the tax broke a manifesto pledge, but said the \"global pandemic was in no-one's manifesto\".\nHowever, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a \"sticking plaster\".\nLeaders in social care also warned the money was \"nowhere near enough\" and would not address current problems.\nThe tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from April 2022, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip.\nThis will be paid by all working adults, including older workers, and the government says it will be \"legally ring-fenced\" to go only towards health and social care costs.\nIncome from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the latest tax increases amounted to \u00a314bn. Together with those announced in the March Budget, it said, 2022 had seen the highest tax rises in 40 years.\nThe UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional \u00a32.2bn to spend on their services. \nThe SNP said the tax would \"unfairly penalise Scottish families - and leave the poorest in society subsidising the wealthy\".\nMPs will vote on the new proposals in the Commons on Wednesday. \nMr Johnson said the proceeds from the tax would lead to \u00a312bn a year being raised, with the majority going into catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations.\nA portion of the money - \u00a35.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nA cap will be introduced on care costs in England from October 2023 of \u00a386,000 over a person's lifetime.\nAll people with assets worth less than \u00a320,000 will then have their care fully covered by the state, and those who have between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 in assets will see their care costs subsidised.\nJune Clay, 92, from Hornchurch, had to go into a nursing home four years ago.\nAs a property owner, June had to \"self-fund\", so sold her house to afford fees which over four years have risen to nearly \u00a31,200 a week.\nHer capital is almost all gone. The local authority will help, but only up to \u00a3640 a week - while the cheapest homes locally charge \u00a3900.\nNow her children, in their 60s, are considering re-mortgaging their own homes and using their pension savings to pay for her care.\n\"I made a promise to my mum, that she would stay in that home... I'm worried sick about it,\" says daughter Sharon.\nBut she fears the reforms will be \"smoke and mirrors\" that will not meet the full costs of care.\nMr Johnson insisted that with the new tax, \"everyone will contribute according to their means\", adding: \"You can't fix the Covid backlogs without giving the NHS the money it needs.\n\"You can't fix the NHS without fixing social care. You can't fix social care without removing the fear of losing everything to pay for social care, and you can't fix health and social care without long-term reform.\"\nBut Labour's Sir Keir said the new tax broke the Conservatives' pledge at the last election not to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. \nHe also said the rise would target young people, supermarket workers and nurses, rather than those with the \"broadest shoulders\" who should pay more. \nThe Labour leader added: \"Read my lips - the Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax.\"\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey - who is a carer himself - also said the tax was \"unfair\", and that the government's plan missed out solutions for staffing shortages, care for working age adults and unpaid family carers. \nMr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes - but he defended the move as \"the right, reasonable and fair approach\" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of \u00a3407bn on support. \nLater, during a press conference, the prime minister said he didn't want to raise taxes further but did not promise there would be no further rises before the next election - despite being asked repeatedly to rule it out. \nMeanwhile, the government has also announced it will suspend the so-called \"triple lock\" on pensions for one year following concerns that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have led to pensions increasing by 8%.\nThe government is raising about \u00a312bn a year for three years with these tax rises. \nJust over \u00a32bn of that goes to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under rules on how UK government spending is split. \nThat leaves \u00a310bn a year for health and social care in England. Most, but not all, of that has been earmarked against particular parts of health and social care. \nAbout \u00a36bn a year has been earmarked for the NHS. \nAnother nearly \u00a32bn a year will go to social care. \nA bit less than half of that will go towards the new funding model (helping people to pay for care) and a bit more than half going on delivering care - training for staff, support for councils and work on making the care and health services work better together. \nSome of the remainder will be spent on tax. The Department of Health and Social Care, and the NHS, are big employers and so a tax rise for employers will mean they have to pay more. \nBut there's still at least a \u00a31bn increase in the DHSC budget that goes into \"other\", with the government saying they'll announce further details in the coming weeks. \nAhead of the announcement, there was a backlash from number of Tory MPs, who said they were against a rise in National Insurance.\nBut questioning the PM after his statement in the Commons, many backbenchers instead sought reassurance that the money raised from the new tax would definitely go towards social care. \nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's World At One that he thought the government had listened to concerns about only making changes to National Insurance, especially as it would \"disproportionately target younger people\" and not pensioners.\nHe said: \"This new tax is more broadly based and the 10% of pensioners who work will pay it as well.\"\nHowever, there was anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised as a result of the tax. \nChief executive of the UK Home Care Association, Dr Jane Townson, said: \"This is nowhere near enough. It will not address current issues and some measures may create new risks.\"\nChairman of the Independent Care Group, Mike Padgham, said it was a \"huge opportunity missed for radical, once-in-a-generation reform of the social care system\", adding it would not address the staffing crisis which was \"sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts\".\nAnd the general secretary of the Unison union, Christina McAnea, said: \"A detailed plan is needed first to mend and future-proof a sector broken by years of neglect. \n\"Only then will the cost of making good the damage become clear.\" \nThe sums are eye-watering, but they've still left health and care bosses disappointed.\nThe Covid pandemic has had a huge toll on the NHS, requiring an overhaul of how services are run and creating a growing backlog in care.\nEven with this money, it will take the health service years to catch up.\nPart of the reason for that is that despite the headline figure of \u00a336bn over three years, by the time the money is shared out across the four UK nations and social care takes a chunk, the frontline of the NHS in England is left with little more than half the \u00a310bn a year health bosses were asking for.\nCouncils are perhaps even more disappointed. \nThe case for social care predates the pandemic. Governments have been dodging it since the late 1990s so the fact that changes are on the way is being welcomed.\nBut the cap only solves one part of the problem - protecting people's assets when they face catastrophic costs.\nYou will still need to be eligible for care to benefit from the cap. Access is rationed so only the most frail qualify - currently half of requests for help are turned down.\nCouncils say the money will do little to help them tackle this."

      "text": "Alice Thompson wanted to work shorter hours to pick her daughter up from nursery, but ended up resigning.\nThe former estate agent spent tens of thousands of pounds pursuing the case against her former employer.\nShe was awarded \u00a3185,000 by an employment tribunal and this week told the BBC it was \"a long, exhausting journey\".\nThe tribunal ruled she had suffered indirect sex discrimination when the firm refused to consider her request.\nMs Thompson was a successful sales manager at a small independent estate agents in central London before she became pregnant in 2018.\n\"I'd put my heart and soul into an estate agency career for more than a decade,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.\n\"That's no mean feat, it's quite a male dominated environment to work in. And I'd worked really hard to build relationships with clients.\"\nWhen she wanted to return to work after maternity leave, she asked her employer if she could work shorter hours, a four day week, and leave at 5pm, rather than the normal end-of-day at 6pm, to pick her daughter up from nursery.\nHer manager said they couldn't afford for her to work part time.\n\"I made a request for flexible working that wasn't seriously considered,\" Ms Thompson says.\n\"I proposed what would have worked for me. If that didn't work for the company, I would have been more than happy to hear a counter offer, what might work for them.\n\"If they needed me for the full hours, maybe eight 'til five instead of nine 'til six, that's something I could have worked around. \n\"But it was shut down, every avenue, not listened to, not considered. And I was left with no other option but to resign.\n\"How are mums meant to have careers and families? It's 2021 not 1971.\"\nShe said she was motivated to pursue the legal challenge in order to prompt change.\n\"I've got a daughter and I didn't want her to experience the same treatment in 20, 30 years' time, when she's in the workplace.\"\nShe said her effort was worth it to \"stand up for what is right\".\nThe tribunal found that the firm's failure to consider more flexible working put Ms Thompson at a disadvantage, and upheld her claim. The judge awarded her almost \u00a3185,000 for loss of earnings, loss of pension contributions, injury to feelings and interest.\n\"Losing a job unexpectedly is always a cause of unhappiness, shock, and sometimes anger, as shown by the way many employees react to redundancy, even when there has been proper consultation, and even when it is never suggested their performance was not good enough,\" the tribunal found.\n\"Here the claimant resented that flexible working appeared not to be considered properly - as in our finding it was not - and felt that this was an injustice because of her sex, which it was.\"\nRead more here from\nHowever several other claims Ms Thompson made regarding her treatment, including discrimination because of pregnancy and maternity, and harassment, were denied by the tribunal.\nThe tribunal found that the director of the Manors estate agency, Paul Sellar, had moved a staff trip to New York from November to August so Ms Thompson could fly in when pregnant, and there were checks to see when the latest was that she could fly.\nWhen there, she did not join the other six for a boat trip.\n\"She did go shopping and then back to the hotel. In our finding she was upset that the others had had a good time drinking and were late back. She may have felt excluded, but it was not because of any action on the part of the respondent,\" the judges said.\nOn the return journey from New York, Mr Sellar commented that Ms Thompson did not seem to have enjoyed the trip, and she replied that she had felt isolated and became tearful.\nA few days later he suggested she should not have gone to New York.\n\"We can understand that Mr Sellar may have found her response ungrateful when the group trip had cost him \u00a325,000,\" the judges said.\nWhile she was determined to pursue the legal action she told Woman's Hour it was challenging.\n\"It's a very emotional process once you've had a child. You have a new identity as a mum, you're trying to figure things out on that field, and then you're going back to work as well,\" said Ms Thompson.\nBut she said workplaces that didn't support returning mothers risked \"missing out on some fantastic women, who have been really successful, because they are short-sighted and don't want to be flexible\".\nShe said many women had reached out to her in the wake of the ruling, many of whom had similar experiences but didn't have the mental or financial capacity to pursue a claim. \n\"It did come at a huge financial cost... and obviously there's the risk you might not get that money back if you lose, but there's a greater picture to trying to make some small change in the world for the better.\"\nThe BBC approached Manors for comment.\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "France,Salah Abdeslam,November 2015 Paris attacks,Paris,Belgium",
      "text": "On the evening of Friday 13 November 2015, Theresa Cede - an Austrian mother of two living in Paris - had invited out her friend St\u00e9phane to celebrate his 40th birthday. Her present: two tickets for Californian band Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan concert hall.\nThey were standing near the entrance next to the concessions stall when three gunmen burst in at 21:47, killing indiscriminately. She was saved by a man who was shot and fell next to her. \n\"I owe him my life. I was shielded by his body, while the shooting continued around us,\" she said.\nAt around 22:00 a policeman and his driver fired at one of the gunmen on stage with a victim, causing the attacker's jacket to explode. Shortly after, the two remaining jihadists retreated in a corridor on the top level of the Bataclan, taking hostages. Theresa and St\u00e9phane were eventually evacuated shortly before the final assault at 00:20.\nNearly six years later it is a moment of reckoning for the thousands of people who, directly or indirectly, found themselves caught up in France's worst ever night of terrorism. \nOpening on Wednesday and set to continue until next May is a trial hallmarked to go down in history.\nIn a specially constructed courtroom in the historic Palais de Justice on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, 20 men will be judged for the jihadist Islamic State (IS) plot that led to 130 dead and hundreds of wounded that night, not just at the Bataclan but also at the Stade de France and on the caf\u00e9-terraces of the 10th and 11th arrondissements.\nAmong the defendants is the last survivor of the 10-man squad who set out on the evening of the attack. \nSalah Abdeslam, 31, was also supposed to blow himself up, but instead he threw away his suicide belt and fled back to Brussels where he was arrested months later. From prison he has said very little, but his questioning will be a key point of the trial.\nTheresa Cede is one of nearly 1,800 civil plaintiffs - mainly survivors and relatives of the dead - who have the right to tell their story before the court. Their memories will take up five weeks of hearings.   \nWhile Theresa has not yet decided to speak herself, she will attend to give support to those who do.\nNearly six years of investigations conducted in 19 countries have resulted in a mountain of evidence. The justice ministry says that the 47,000 depositions and statements amount to 542 volumes which stacked up would reach 53 metres in height. \nThe aim of the trial is not just to establish the guilt or innocence of the 20 accused, it is also to document the origins, planning and execution of the 13 November conspiracy:\nTo accommodate the large numbers of lawyers, plaintiffs, journalists and members of the public, it was decided to convert an entire gallery of the 19th-Century Palais de Justice. \nThe gallery now contains a 45m (147ft) by 15m wood-panelled salle, with seating for 600, which will be the main courtroom, as well as two other principal rooms for press and relatives.\nWith other smaller rooms also fitted with projection screens, there is space for up to 2,000 people - though after the opening it is estimated only a fraction of that number will attend.  \nThe whole trial will be filmed for posterity, as was the smaller Charlie Hebdo trial last year, and an online radio feed will be available to survivors and other plaintiffs so they can keep abreast of developments.\nBuilt at a cost of \u20ac7m (\u00a36m), the new courtroom will be used over the next two years for other terror trials - such as the one arising from the Nice lorry attack of July 2016. The scale of the enterprise is meant to impress on the French the solemnity and historic nature of the trial.\nIn the words of Le Monde newspaper, \"It is the ultimate response of democratic nations to the challenge of terrorism: the law; all the law; nothing but the law.\" \nAmong the accused, attention will inevitably focus on Salah Abdeslam. This is because in the established account of 13 November, he was the one who was supposed to die but didn't.  \nA childhood friend of Abdelhamid Abaaoud (the leader of the commando group who died in a shoot-out in Saint-Denis on 18 November), he allegedly played an important role ferrying the newly arrived jihadists by car from Germany and Hungary to Brussels.  \nHe is said to have rented cars and hotel rooms in Paris, and then driven the three suicide-bombers to the Stade de France.\nBut there is still uncertainty over what happened next. Leaving his car in the 18th arrondissement, he dumped the suicide vest in the suburb of Montrouge and after calling a friend in Brussels was picked up and driven back to Belgium.  \nA few months later, just before the deadly Brussels suicide attacks of March 2016 - carried out by the same IS militant cell set up by Abaaoud - Salah Abdeslam was arrested in Molenbeek. \nHe told police that he had a change of heart and that was why he did not blow himself up. But the investigation established that the suicide vest was in fact defective - opening the possibility that he tried but failed to complete his mission. \nOf the other 19 defendants, six are absent and five of them are presumed dead: senior IS men probably killed in US drone strikes. The sixth is in prison in Turkey. Of the others some are accused of helping the gang without necessarily knowing the extent of the conspiracy.\nBut others, it is alleged, were important figures, and some may themselves have been intended as suicide-bombers on the night of the attack. \nOne of the more intriguing items of evidence in the case is a computer abandoned by the gang and found in Brussels following the March 2016 attacks there. \nThis included a schedule setting out the 13 November attacks, including the three Paris targets - but also two more: Schiphol airport in the Netherlands and \"metro\". \nOne theory is that a fourth squad - including two of the accused at the trial - may have been ordered to attack Schiphol.\nThere is also the possibility that Salah Abdeslam himself may have been told to attack the Paris metro, at the point where he abandoned his car. This would explain why the IS propaganda machine included a non-existent attack on the 18th arrondissement in its list of \"victories\" that night. \nFor Theresa Cede, the first year after the attacks was spent compiling all the information she could find about what had happened at the Bataclan. \"I had to find people who were there; I had to hear their stories; I had this absolute need to understand,\" she says. \n\"I am naturally an outgoing and resilient person. I had a job, a husband and two kids. My absolute priority at the start was that I would not let it have an impact on my family. But that was wishful thinking.\" \nFrom the start she says she had to change which side of the bed she slept on, because of spending two and a half hours next to her dead protector. \n\"Things suddenly bubble up,\" she says. \"When one of my sons had a birthday the sulphur smell of the candles set me off. When he went to a show with his school, the sight of the theatre with those velvet seats was another trigger.\"\nFor Theresa, as for many others. the weeks ahead will be tough, as the memories are brought out once again under the public gaze. Tough, she says, but necessary. \n\"The trial is an important step. It has to be gone through. I am not sure it will bring closure or solace. But it is part of the process.\"  s"

      "tags": "Companies,Amazon,Tax,UK economy",
      "text": "Online shopping giant Amazon has said it is \"proud\" of its contribution to the UK economy, as it reveals its latest financial results.\nThe firm paid \u00a3492m in direct taxation as its sales rose 50% to \u00a320.63bn, amid a Covid-driven surge in demand.\nAmazon and other tech firms, which pay tax on profits not sales, have faced scrutiny over the level of their tax bills in the UK.  \nBut Amazon said it had invested \u00a332bn in UK infrastructure since 2010.\n\"We are proud of the significant economic contribution we are making to the UK economy,\" Amazon said in a statement.\n\"Looking ahead, we know that the UK remains full of opportunity and we continue to be excited by the potential to continue to invest, create jobs, develop talent and have a positive impact in communities across the country,\" the statement added. \nAmazon's total sales in the UK, rose to \u00a320.63bn during 2020 - up by more than 50% from \u00a313.73bn in 2019.  \nThe direct tax bill was up by more than two-thirds compared with the \u00a3293m it paid in the previous year. \nThe firm, which employs 55,000 people in the UK, said the taxes included business rates, stamp duty, corporation tax and other contributions.\nAmazon said employers' national insurance taxes accounted for the majority of the bill as it took on 22,000 more staff over the course of the last year.\nThe company's indirect tax bill came to \u00a31.06bn, up from \u00a3854m, driven by VAT on increased sales and employee taxes, as it took on more people and increased wages. \nAmazon said that when both direct and indirect taxation were taken into account, it had contributed \u00a31.55bn, up from \u00a31.15bn. \nGMB, the union for Amazon workers, said the company's tax bill was \"frankly insulting\" and said firms that had profited from the pandemic should pay more.\nMick Rix, GMB National Officer, said:\"Amazon workers suffer unsafe, dehumanising work practices; breaking bones, falling unconscious and being taken away in ambulances.\n\"Ministers must get a grip of this runaway company and make sure pandemic profiteers pay more.\n\"Amazon's key UK business paid just \u00a33.8m more corporation tax last year than in 2019, even as sales increased by \u00a31.89bn.\" \nIn April last year, the UK government launched a 2% tax on digital sales amid concerns that big tech firms were re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions. The Digital Services Tax is also included in the \u00a3492m figure. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said in June last year that the coronavirus crisis had made tech giants even \"more powerful and more profitable\".\nOther global tech firms have faced similar scrutiny over their tax bills.\nFrench tax authorities recently settled disputes with Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon over their operations in the country over the last decade. \nLast year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech firms and backed plans by think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to find a global solution.\n\"As usual the accounts are legally compliant but opaque and lack the crucial information about intra-group transactions which enable the company to shift profits is not there,\" said Labour peer and emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield and University of Essex, Prem Sikka.\n\"Therefore it's impossible to know what their true economic profit is,\" Prof Sikka said.  \nGiven the profits declared by competitors, Prof Sikka said Amazon's tax bill \"seems very low\", whereas, for retailers such as supermarket chains, tax bills as a proportion of sales were much higher.  \n\"We need a complete change in accounting regulations which currently increase opacity rather than transparency,\" Prof Sikka added. \nProfessor of taxation law at King's College London, Ann Mumford agreed and said that there was a lack of public discussion around the rules which led to this amount of tax. \n\"It seems that Amazon realised that they would need to pay a respectable amount - and, are hoping that an increase of \u00a33.8 million sounds like a lot of money,\" Prof Mumford added. \nThe pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online shopping and Amazon has been one of the biggest winners amid those changing consumer trends. \nAs Covid closed physical stores during successive lockdowns, sales at the internet giant rocketed. \nToday's numbers will raise further questions about how tech giants operate, the level of tax they pay and their impact on the struggling High Street. \nAmazon moved to fend off criticism by pointing out that its direct tax bill increased by more than two-thirds from the \u00a3293m it paid in 2019. \nCritics say that's still nowhere near enough given the surge in sales. \nThe firm's been on a hiring spree to meet soaring demand, offering a \u00a31,000 joining bonus to encourage staff to work in its fulfilment centres in the north east of England."

      "text": "The government has denied newspaper reports that it is planning an October lockdown in England.\nThe i newspaper said plans had been drawn up to extend the school half-term holiday, if the number of hospitalisations continue at the current level.\nThe i said a full lockdown was unlikely - but the government could introduce some rules as part of a \"firebreak\".\nHowever the Department for Education said the report was \"not true\".\n\"It is not true that the government is planning a lockdown or firebreak around the October half term,\" it said in a tweet.\nThe prime minister's spokesman also denied the report. He said plans had been kept for a range of scenarios - \"but these kind of measures would only be reintroduced as a last resort to prevent unsustainable pressure on our NHS\".\n\"I think we've been clear throughout that we will take action, and indeed we have done when necessary to protect our NHS,\" he said.\nBut the spokesman pointed out that when rules were brought in the past, the UK did not yet have the protection from vaccines. \nOn Tuesday the UK recorded another 37,489 coronavirus cases, with 209 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nFour in five people in the UK aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the latest figures show. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was \"a phenomenal achievement\".\nIf the NHS was at risk of collapse the return of restrictions is possible. Contingency plans are, of course, in place. \nBut the key question is - what is the likelihood of this? Very few of those scientists advising government think it's a likely scenario. \nAnd - as one scientist put it to me - \"if we were going to suggest anything it wouldn't be closing schools\".\nThat's not to say there isn't real concern about winter. \nCovid, plus the return of normal winter viruses made worse by lack of immunity from social distancing and lockdown last year, means the coming months are likely to be very difficult for the NHS. \nCare could be rationed and performance deteriorate as happens quite often in winter.\nBut it is important to remember currently fewer than 7% of beds are occupied by Covid patients - and the numbers are not rising rapidly.\nEarlier, the government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped booster jabs would avoid the need for any new lockdown rules.\n\"Look, vaccines have given us the ability to reduce infections, to save 100,000 lives,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"I'm not going to be arrogant and say to you this is a done deal, it's all over, it's fine, this virus is no longer in pandemic stage. \n\"But I hope through the booster programme we can transition the virus from pandemic to endemic status and deal with it year in, year out... but not have to close down our economy or take the severe measures we had to sadly take in December of last year.\"\nThe first booster vaccines for the most vulnerable are expected this month.\nThe latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the government on vaccines -  suggests more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose of Covid vaccine.\nThat number includes all over-50s and anyone over 16 who qualifies for a flu jab.\nSeparately to the booster jabs, about 400,000 to 500,000 people in the UK who are severely immuno-suppressed will also be eligible for a third dose of vaccine. This is different to a booster jab, and they may also get a booster at a later date.\nMr Zahawi also emphasised that the flu vaccine was important. \n\"I worry about flu,\" he said. \"We've got a big flu programme that has begun and will continue throughout the winter months as well as, I hope, our Covid booster programme which will begin shortly this month.\"\nThe number of people in hospital with coronavirus has been slowly climbing in recent weeks - although it is still far below the peak in January this year.\nSo far, nearly 80% of adults in the UK are fully vaccinated, while almost 89% have had a first dose.

      "text": "The Public Health Agency (PHA) is set to take over responsibility for the contact tracing of close contacts of Covid-19 cases in schools, BBC News NI understands.\nIf approved, the move is expected to reduce the number of pupils who have to self-isolate and miss time in school.\nIt is also expected to ease demand for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\nSchools will be urged to encourage pupils to take twice-weekly lateral flow device (LFD) tests.\nThe aim is also to ease the burden placed on principals and school leaders to trace close contacts.\nThe Ulster Teachers' Union said schools had faced a \"tsunami\" of Covid-19 cases and related absences in recent days.\nPrincipals' representatives and teaching unions are expected to be consulted on the plans later.\nThey are similar to arrangements for schools currently in place in England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe change will certainly improve things for school principals and senior school staff who have had to take on the bulk of contact tracing at the minute, when there has been a positive case. \nThey could contact the PHA for advice, but many principals reported it could take a while for them to get that advice. \nReally it has been down to principals and schools to do the bulk of contact tracing when there is a positive case in school. \nI think sometimes they have perhaps been erring on the side of caution, and sending whole year groups home if there has been a positive case, or whole classes. \nI think the PHA might be able to be a bit more forensic in identifying exactly who was a close contact. \nThat means the surge in demand for PCR tests in some parts of Northern Ireland would be somewhat reduced.\nNew self-isolation guidance for schools was issued on 26 August.\nIt changed previous guidance for close contacts to isolate for 10 days and aimed to reduce the time children spent out of school.\nBut the logistical burden of tracing asymptomatic close contacts has, in the main, been the responsibility of school principals and staff.\nThat has also led to high numbers of pupils self-isolating and seeking negative PCR tests to return to school.\nAny child with symptoms is still expected to stay off school and get a PCR test.\nIf that is positive they must self-isolate for 10 days.\nIf the move is approved by principals' representatives and unions, guidance on how the new arrangements will operate will be provided to schools.\nA number of teaching unions in Northern Ireland have called for the PHA to take responsibility for identifying close contacts of pupils in schools.\nPrincipal from Maghaberry Primary School and President of National Association of Headteachers NI (NAHTni) Graham Gault said the development was a \"significant step\".\nHe said contact tracing should never have fallen to school leaders.\nChris Donnelly, principal of St John The Baptist Primary School in Finaghy, said that while schools \"will welcome the easing of any type of administrative burden associated with contact tracing\" it was the case that \"the devil will be in the detail\". \nJustin McCamphill from teachers' union NASUWT said that while taking the job of contact tracing \"away from school principals\" was welcome, the union was urging caution around the proposals. \n\"We do worry that the PHA may not have the capacity to identify close cases as quickly as school principals did,\" Mr McCamphill told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"The experience of our leaders over the past few weeks has been that they have difficulty getting through to the PHA advice line.\n\"We think now if parents and pupils are making direct contact we don't know if the capacity is going to be there.\n\"The other issue of course is that if a six or seven-year-old is a close contact and gives their friend's name, how are the PHA going to make contact with that friend without going back through the school?\"\nMr McCamphill added that the union did not see the plan as \"something that's going to fix everything straight away\".\nIn England, Scotland and Wales public health authorities take on the responsibility for tracing close contacts of school pupils.\nIn Wales, for instance, the Test, Trace and Protect (TTP) programme gathers information from positive cases on their close contacts.\nChildren under 16 are spoken to alongside a parent or guardian.\nThe public health authorities, rather than schools, then advise close contacts whether they have to self-isolate or seek a PCR test.\nSimilar arrangements are in place in Scotland with the aim that whole classes or year groups are not routinely asked to stay at home in the event of a positive case."

The US Geological Survey says that geophysicists differ in the extent to which they think that individual reports of unusual lighting associated with an earthquake actually represent EQL.\nSome researchers think they occur due to friction between moving rocks creating electrical activity.

      "tags": "Tax,Personal finance,Social care,Pay,Income tax",
      "text": "National Insurance payments are increasing in April, to fund social care in England and help the NHS recover after the pandemic.\nBut there has been criticism that the move is unfair on the lower-paid, especially when the cost of living is rising.\nEmployees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022.\nBut from April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate.\nInstead, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy.\nThis levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working.\nFrom April, people earning under \u00a39,880 a year, or \u00a3823 a month, won't have to pay National Insurance, or the new levy when it is introduced.\nHowever, those earning more than \u00a312,875 a year will pay more.\nFor example, an employee on \u00a320,000 a year will pay an extra \u00a389 a year. Someone on \u00a350,000 will pay \u00a3464 more. \nNational Insurance is a UK-wide tax.\nAlthough the government decision to increase it is focussed on funding health and social care in England, the tax increase is also expected to raise an additional \u00a32.2bn for services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThere are concerns the increase will have a higher impact on the lower-paid.\nThis is because workers pay 12% National Insurance on earnings between \u00a39,564 (\u00a39,880 from April) and \u00a350,268. However, earnings above this amount attract a rate of just 2%. \nSo, if your income rises above \u00a350,000, National Insurance takes a smaller proportion of your wages. \nThe Health and Social Care Levy will work the same way as National Insurance.\nThe government is also going back on a promise made in its 2019 election manifesto not to raise National Insurance.\nHowever, Boris Johnson said the increase was because of Covid and the burden it placed on the NHS.\nThe government says the changes are expected to raise \u00a312bn a year.\nInitially, this will go towards easing pressure on the NHS .\nA proportion will then be moved into the social care system.\nThis mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication.\nThe aim is to make sure people in England pay no more than \u00a386,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food).\nAnyone with assets - like their home, savings and investments - worth less than \u00a320,000 will have their care fully covered by the state.\nThose with between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 in assets will have their care costs subsidised.\nAt present, to get your care paid for by your local council, you must have a very high level of need and also savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 in England.\nBelow that level the amount you pay reduces until you have less than \u00a314,250, at which point the council pays for your care if you qualify.\nThe care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the pandemic. It has been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending.\nThis has also put pressure on the NHS because people cannot be discharged from hospital if they don't have anywhere suitable to go.\nIn Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than \u00a3100 a week.\nIn Northern Ireland, no-one over the age of 75 pays for home care.\nScotland provides free personal care for people who are assessed as needing support at home, whatever their age.\nIn Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than \u00a318,000. \nThose with savings and assets of between \u00a318,000 and \u00a328,750 have to fund part of their care. \nPeople with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a \u00a3193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and \u00a387.10 a week towards nursing care.\nUPDATE: Figures for how much the increase in National Insurance will cost were updated to take into account the rise in the primary threshold from April 2022 in line with inflation."

      "tags": "Global supply chain management,Freight transport,Haulage",
      "text": "The government is expected to announce a shake-up of the HGV driver testing process as soon as Thursday.\nIt wants to fast track drivers into the haulage industry amid chronic shortages which have caused supply problems.  \nThe BBC understands that during meetings between government officials, hauliers and suppliers, the \"penny finally dropped\" that the driver shortage was getting worse not better.\nThe government said meetings with affected groups were ongoing.\nIt added any change in policy would be announced in due course.  \nWidespread supply chain issues caused by the driver shortage have hit a range of sectors, including food, drink and medicines. \n\"The government seem to finally understand the scale of the problem. For the first time they looked rattled\", industry sources told the BBC.  \nIt's thought the centrepiece of the proposals could include combining the Class C test used for rigid lorries and Class E for larger articulated lorries into a single test. \nCurrently, there is usually a 2-3 week minimum period between taking the two tests.   \nThe haulage industry said a perfect storm of a post-Brexit exodus of drivers, an ageing and retiring workforce and COVID-related delays to testing new drivers had brought some supply chains to breaking point.\nHaulage firms, desperate for drivers to fill lorries left idle and to complete orders left unfulfilled, welcomed the move but warned that it would not be enough to fix the cracks appearing in supply chains.\nThey reiterated their calls for HGV drivers to be added to the Shortage Occupation List which would allow firms to temporarily bring back some of the estimated 20,000 EU drivers who have left the industry. \nPaul Jackson of Chiltern Distribution said: \"This is a sensible move but it's not enough to fix the problem. \n\"We don't put newly qualified drivers straight behind the wheel on their own. We buddy them up with experienced drivers for the first 8-10 weeks and the insurance costs for new drivers are also much higher. \n\"We desperately need to put HGV drivers on the list of skilled workers we can bring in from abroad.\"\nThe Chemical Business Association, which represents chemical firms within the supply chain, reiterated concerns that its members were struggling to get chemicals to water companies.\nTim Doggett, its chief executive, said: \"The supply chain situation in the UK is deteriorating.\" \nA survey conducted by the industry group suggests 96% of member companies are now experiencing issues with UK haulage, up from 63% in its last survey in June.\nThe Chemical Business Association has written to ministers warning about the effects of driver shortages.\nThe group write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June, saying that \"there was a contingent risk to the supply of chemicals into vital areas such as water treatment, which would be critical to the health and wellbeing of the population\".\nThe government is expected to say that the new regime will mean up to 3,000 new drivers can be tested per week. \nCurrently the pass rate is 56% so that would mean an extra 1,600 drivers per week. \nBut Richard Burnett of the Road Haulage Association said the industry was losing 600 drivers a week from the industry and with a net shortfall of 90,000 drivers, it would take nearly two years to fill the gap.  \nThe industry was already reporting shortages of about 60,000 drivers before Brexit and the pandemic. \nEven allowing for that, he said there was no way to plug the recent gaps in time for Christmas - when the UK is more reliant on EU food imports.  \nIn addition, the RHA said the onset of winter weather would throw up obstacles. \"The reality is that an industry already struggling to meet delivery schedules will be brought to its knees at the first outbreak of bad weather conditions.\" \nThe managing director of BJS Distribution Storage and Couriers, Harinder Singh, said the new shorter test was \"not a solution it is a risk\".\n\"Making the test easier does not make better drivers. The solution to the current shortage is to allow temporary visas to drivers from countries that understand the legislation and legal driving parameters of the UK, otherwise this isn't going to solve itself. \n\"By making the test easier you are putting more risk onto the road,\" he added.

      "tags": "Attorney General,Darlington,Sentencing in England and Wales",
      "text": "The sentence given to a man who choked a woman to death during sex is being reviewed by the Attorney General to decide if it was unduly lenient.\nSam Pybus, 32, was jailed for four years and eight months after admitting the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, 33, at her home in Darlington on 7 February.\nCampaigners said the \"outrageous\" sentence sent a \"dreadful message\".\nReferring the sentence for review, MP Harriet Harman said it \"fails to reflect the gravity of the crime\".\nA spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said the review under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme would take place within 28 days and, if successful, the case would be referred to the Court of Appeal.\nMs Harman said Pybus' \"disgraceful mitigation\" that Ms Moss, a mother of two young boys, encouraged strangulation during sex made it sound as if it was \"her fault\".\n\"[Pybus] sought to shift the responsibility for Sophie's death from himself to her claiming that she both encouraged and enjoyed his placing pressure on her neck,\" Ms Harman said.\nThe MP said: \"The sentence fails to reflect the gravity of the crime, the impact of her death on her family, his sole culpability for her death, his cynical shifting of the responsibility from himself to her and sends out the message that killing your girlfriend during sex is a minor matter.\"\nWe Can't Consent To This, a campaign group set up in response to so-called \"consensual\" violence claims against women, also criticised the sentence.\nSpokeswoman Fiona Mackenzie said: \"It seems that strangling a woman to death is still viewed in law as an unfortunate accident, rather than terrible serious violence.\n\"This sends a dreadful message to women - four years and eight months is an outrageous sentence.\nThe Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows anyone to lobby the Attorney General to send a case to the Court of Appeal for review. Very experienced senior judges then consider the term given to an offender and how it compares to any relevant guidelines on sentencing and previous similar crimes. \nJudge Paul Watson reduced Pybus' initial sentence of seven years because the law required him to give the killer a discount for his early admission that he was guilty of manslaughter - the crime of unintentionally causing Ms Moss' death. \nPybus said he never intended to kill, leading to the Crown Prosecution Service ruling out a murder charge. But he could not avoid a manslaughter conviction by claiming it was \"rough sex gone wrong\". \nSome 28 years ago, the UK's then most senior judges declared that nobody can consent to serious harm as part of sado-masochistic sex - a ruling that was recently reasserted in the 2021 Domestic Abuse Act.\nPybus, who was married, had been seeing Ms Moss for sex about six times a year for three years without his wife's knowledge,  Teesside Crown Court previously heard.\nOn 6 February he had drunk 24 bottles of Amstel lager over 10 hours, and drove to Ms Moss's flat after his wife went to bed.\nAt 04:43 GMT the following morning he drove to Darlington police station and told staff he believed he had strangled Ms Moss.\nHe said that during sex he would apply pressure to her neck, \"an act he said she encouraged\", but added he would never hurt her.\nThe claim she encouraged strangulation during sex was confirmed by her long-term partner, the court heard.\nInstead of giving Ms Moss first aid, Pybus went to his car and thought about what to do for 15 minutes before driving to the police station, the court was told.\nOn Tuesday Judge Paul Watson QC said he accepted Pybus, of Water View, Middleton St George, Darlington, did not intend to kill and believed he had genuine remorse.\nIn a victim statement Ms Moss's brother said she had been \"taken advantage of and exploited\".\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "Support for pupils who have special needs is \"beyond crisis\" in England and \"sucking money from budgets\" for all children, a report says.\nNearly all schools (97%) responding to a survey by a head teachers' union said they received insufficient funding to support pupils who had special needs.\nThe National Association of Head Teachers says funding has to rise so all pupils can be supported to learn.\nThe government said its review of the system aimed to improve things.\nFunding for higher-level needs was rising 9.6% in 2022-23 and the Department for Education was providing \u00a342m to projects for pupils who had special educational needs and disabilities (Send).\nBut the NAHT report, based on a survey of 1,500 head teachers, suggests nearly a third of schools have cut services in the past year.\nAnd the starkest findings relate to funding for education for pupils who have Send.\n\"Special needs is beyond crisis in schools - it is sucking the money from budgets,\" Lesley Roberts, head teacher of a Berkshire primary, said.\nSimon Kidwell, head teacher of Hartford Manor Primary School, in Cheshire, said: \"The moment we get a child moving to us with recognised special needs, we are already in deficit.\"\nThis is because schools are required by local authorities to show they are spending the equivalent of 15 hours teaching assistant time -\u00a36,000 in the case of Hartford Manor Primary on an pupil with an EHCR before they can get any extra money. \nAnd one pupil now attended a residential care setting, which may well have been avoidable if they had not been refused the early help the school requested at age seven.\nSeparately, parents and carers of children who have special needs have written to the prime minister, demanding better in-school provision. \nThey are concerned the government review has had little input from affected families and may actually weaken the law, which the Department for Education denies.\nLet Us Learn Too campaign co-founder Hayley Harding said: \"Before my son was diagnosed with autism, I would never have believed the fight that families have to go to just to enable their children to learn, in England. \n\"The right laws are there but unfortunately many local authorities blatantly ignore them, leaving many children unable to go to school. \n\"This review is the perfect opportunity to rectify this and introduce accountability.\"\nJason Bailey's daughter, Aime, is autistic - and the anxiety her condition causes leads to reflex anoxic seizures, during which her heart briefly stops.\nHer local authority said she had no medical need for an education health and care plan (EHCP) - but no school would admit her without additional support, so the 12-year-old attends a unit offering short-term provision for children too ill for mainstream education. \nJason feels fortunate Aime has a place there - but the curriculum is very narrow and she is in a class of three, so it is hard to make friends.\n\"She wants to go to school and be able to get a full education, the same as any of her peers, in an environment that is nurturing enough to allow her to attend,\" he says.\n\"It has been incredibly stressful, the amount of times we have been in tears and Aime's been in tears thinking she is putting pressure on the family. \n\"There is no understanding from the local authority.\n\"The review taking place has no direct input from anyone who has involvement with Send children. \n\"And if you do not have people affected by it, how can you make an effective decision?\"\nNicola Shortt's son Hunter has a complex brain injury and attends a mainstream school, with full-time one-on-one assistance.\nTheir local authority initially refused to assess him - and every year she has to battle to ensure his care plan is fit for purpose, she says, once resorting to paying a solicitor \u00a3900 to write to the council.\n\"It is exhausting - and it doesn't end,\" she says.\n\"Services for disabled children in general are just massively underfunded and we have seen cuts with successive governments to the point where service delivery is not viable.\n\"Parents have to keep going round and round this process or have the financial means to use solicitors.\"\nNAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said despite the rhetoric on extra investment, school budgets were under enormous pressure. \n\"A far more ambitious programme of investment is required from the government if schools are going to be able to deliver the education that the current generation of pupils need and deserve,\" he added.\nLabour shadow education secretary Kate Green said schools were having to make cuts because of the government's record of underfunding education.\nLocal council bosses called for reforms to ensure special-needs funding was sustainable."

      "text": "Rents outside London are soaring at their fastest rate in more than a decade, according to a property website.\nZoopla said private rental prices across the UK increased by 5% in the 12 months to the end of July - adding \u00a3456 a year to the average tenant's bill.\nThe 5% jump is the biggest recorded since Zoopla's index started in 2008.\nThe firm said it was down to increased demand for city living amid limited supply.\nAs lockdown restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened in city centres, there has been a marked return to more built-up areas, it said.\nIn August, the stock of property available to rent outside the capital was about a third below typical levels, while supply was already under pressure.\nAs a result, average rents for the UK, excluding London, stand at \u00a3790 per month, up from \u00a3752 a year ago.\nZoopla's head of research, Grainne Gilmore, said: \"The strong levels of rental demand seen across the UK during August will moderate in line with seasonal trends, but overall demand for rental property is likely to remain higher than usual in the coming months, amid this swing back to city life.\"\nShe cautioned that the market would be likely to depend on the path of the Covid-19 virus and any potential lockdown restrictions being re-introduced.\n\"But given no deviation from the current landscape, the demand for rental property, coupled with lower levels of supply, will continue to put upward pressure on rents,\" she added.\nInner cities across the UK, such as Edinburgh, have seen the highest growth in demand, although Zoopla's data showed London saw a decline of -3.8% in July on an annual basis.\nBut competition remains fierce for properties, the platform said, with rents now typically agreed within just 15 days of a property being listed.\nHalifax, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, recently said that while house prices hit a record high in August, the annual pace of growth in property values slowed.\nIt said, however, that the broader economic picture was positive, with high job vacancies and consumer confidence returning, which benefited the overall housing market. \nWhere can you afford to live in the UK - and is it cheaper to rent or buy?

In May, it announced the acquisition of Scroll, an article reading and optimisation service, which it plans to roll into its paid offerings. \n\"Scroll will become a meaningful addition to our subscriptions work as we build and shape a future subscription service,\" it wrote at the time.  \nTwitter also announced another test which allows users to remove followers. \nPreviously, the only way to prevent people seeing your tweets was to protect them - meaning you would have to approve requests to follow you - or to block individual users. \nThe new feature, being tested in the web browser version of Twitter, will let users remove people from their \"followers\" list.  \nBut there is nothing to stop that person then re-following later. \nIt is an official way to do what is commonly called a soft block - where someone will block and then immediately unblock someone to remove the follower without notifying them.

      "text": "Record numbers of 18-year-olds in the UK have accepted university places this year, according to updated figures from the Ucas admissions service.\nThere will be 272,500 of this age cohort starting at UK universities - up by 7% on last year.\nBut a sharp fall in EU students coming to the UK means overall university numbers are slightly down this year.\nUcas head Clare Marchant said students had worked hard for places despite \"incredibly trying circumstances\".\nThese latest figures show rising numbers of UK students of all ages getting university places, up to 448,000, along with more overseas students coming to the UK from countries such as China and Nigeria.\nThe \"resilience\" of rising demand for university places has confounded earlier warnings about the impact of Covid, says the admission service's head of data, Richard O'Kelly.\nDespite the switch to online learning, lack of access to social activities, Covid outbreaks and complaints about value for money, more UK students have accepted places than before the pandemic.\nBut the overall figure of almost 508,000 new students is slightly down on this point last year, after a 56% fall in students from EU countries such as France, Germany and Italy.\nIt means there will be more students from Peru than Denmark, more from Kuwait than the Netherlands - and more from China than all the EU countries combined.\nApplications are still open for this year's courses, but the trends show record numbers of UK school-leavers heading to university.\nAlmost 38% of 18-year-olds have so far decided to go to university, the highest ever proportion. Although entry numbers for those aged 19 and over are slightly down on last year.\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the continuing rise in UK student numbers showed \"young people are voting with their feet and behaving entirely rationally\". \n\"They are not snowflakes who melt under heat. They are rational, ambitious and full of aspiration.\"\nMr Hillman said university was still an ambition for families and that \"when the labour market is in flux and the world is in crisis, getting more education is a very sensible response\".\nOn the fall in EU student numbers, he said it reflected the higher fees they would be charged after the UK left the EU.\nThe update on university admissions, a month after exam results, shows a relatively high number of applicants still to decide on whether to take a place - with the suggestion they might have narrowly missed out on a preference and are considering whether to reapply next year.\nFigures for England show the regional divide is getting wider, with increasing numbers of students coming from London, the South and the Midlands, while numbers have fallen in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.\nCompared with 2012, the number of students from London has risen by 26%, while in the North East, numbers have slightly fallen.\nClare Marchant said she expected numbers of acceptances to continue increasing over the next few weeks.\n\"We know that some students, particularly mature applicants looking to study at their local university or college, often make a late decision through clearing, so we expect numbers to rise before the end of the cycle,\" she said.\nA spokesman for the Russell Group said its universities \"made more offers this year to UK 18-year-olds, including those from the most deprived areas, reflecting their determination to be fair and flexible so students were not disadvantaged by this year's changes to the assessment system\". \nA Universities UK spokeswoman said: \"It's brilliant to see record numbers of students recognising the benefits of a university degree.\n\"Embarking on a degree is a uniquely exciting time, with the skills and experience students set to gain lasting a lifetime, giving them an edge in the employment market and generating significant benefits for the UK as we rebuild from the pandemic.\""

(The first \u00a320,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals).\nHowever, someone with a \u00a3500,000 house would be left with \u00a3414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value.\nFurther changes to the cap were announced last week. \nThe government said:\nSo, if someone's care costs \u00a3860 a week and they are meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap.\nHowever, if the same person receives council help it would take longer than 100 weeks.\nThat means poorer people receiving means-tested help will make contributions from their own money for longer.\nSally Warren, director of policy at The King's Fund health charity said \"These changes will mean that the people who need the most protection from catastrophically high care costs - those with low to moderate levels of wealth - will get less protection than wealthier people.\" \nThe government, however, says it wants to ensure people get support but are not unfairly reaching the cap at an artificially faster rate than others. \nThe cap doesn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people will have to meet these costs \"including after they reach the cap\".\nThe government has confirmed living costs will be up to \u00a3200 a week.\nTen years ago, an independent review by Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a lifetime cap of \u00a335,000 for social care costs - but this was not introduced.\nSir Andrew said the changes the government was now introducing were \"a significant step forward\".\nBut he said the move would not stop the less well-off facing \"catastrophic costs\"."

      "text": "Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that criminal penalties for terminating pregnancies are unconstitutional. \nThe ruling, for the northern state of Coahuila, prevents women from being prosecuted for getting an abortion.\nAbortion is currently severely restricted in all but four of the country's states.\nSupreme Court Justice Luis Maria Aguilar described the move as a \"historic step for the rights of women\". \nOn Tuesday, the court ordered the state of Coahuila to remove sanctions for abortion from its criminal code. \nThe decision could pave the way for the decriminalisation of abortions across the country. \nCurrently, abortion is only legal in a handful of states, except in cases of rape or where the mother's life is in danger. \nA judicial source said the ruling will affect the whole of Mexico, allowing women in states where abortion is criminalised to undergo the procedure with a judge's order. \nThe Information Group on Reproductive Choice (GIRE), which campaigns for abortion rights, described the decision as \"historic\".\n\"We hope that throughout the country women and people with the ability to carry a child have the conditions and freedom to determine their reproductive destiny,\" it said.\nCoahuila borders the US state of Texas, where the Supreme Court allowed a state law banning all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. \nThe ruling could open up avenues for people from Texas seeking legal abortions.\nThe decision to decriminalise abortion in what is Latin America's second largest Catholic nation might appear surprising. \nHowever, the debate in Mexico has been gradually moving towards removing the illegality for some time. \nHigh profile protests by feminist and women's rights campaigners have underlined the need for greater reproductive rights in Mexico. \nSpecifically, the Supreme Court was asked to rule on a law in the northern state of Coahuila which punishes women who have illegal abortions with jail terms of up to three years. \nThe 11 Supreme Court judges unanimously voted to decriminalise abortion in that state, and under Mexican law, it will now apply to all the other states in the country.\nIt is likely to take some time to be applied across the nation, but in effect the decision provides each state with a roadmap towards new legislation. \nFurthermore, it should mean that women who were jailed for having abortions will be immediately released. \nThe decision is likely to anger more conservative politicians in Mexico and the Catholic Church. However, the church's influence has been waning in recent years and the government considers itself staunchly secular. "

The hope is by earmarking it for health and care and separating out this levy on all tax bills, that the public won't mind."

A few more Covid admissions, which could be prevented, will cause us to stop operating because we simply haven't got the capacity to do both.\"\nDuring this latest surge, the hospital's 14-bed ICU was divided in two. \nOn one side, doctors and nurses battled to help save the lives of those who have had serious surgery or major trauma.\nJust a few metres away, on the other side of a wall, they were battling Covid and Dr Gardiner said beds were \"at a premium\".\nIndeed, there was just one spare ICU bed for the patient whose surgery went ahead.\nOther operations were also cancelled.\nAccording to Dr Gardiner, chronic staff shortages meant specialist staff could not be spread across the Belfast Trust's three separate hospital sites.\nAnd one-to-one nursing care, the gold standard for ICU, was no longer possible.\nDr Gardiner said they were at \"the very limit with what we can achieve\".\n\"My biggest fear is that we won't be able to keep going with cancer surgery; that we will be overwhelmed with Covid admissions; with routine winter admissions and that we will have to stop routine cancer surgery.\n\"We do not want to be faced with having to ask or decide who is going to get their operation and who is not; who is going to get an ICU bed and who is not.\"\nIn Covid ICU - the hospital's \"red zone\"  - the battle to save lives is constant.\nIt's hideously bright, stiflingly hot and the cacophony of hissing ventilators, beeping alarms and buzzing machinery bombard the senses. \nWhile the atmosphere is almost oppressive, each alert is a sign that the fight is not lost.\nAll patients are heavily sedated and hooked up to numerous pieces of medical equipment.\nNone are capable of speaking.\nAt one point, it took seven staff to prone [turn] a woman in her 60s.\n\"That helps us to improve the oxygen level,\" explained consultant Martin Duffy.\n\"We have been doing it very frequently during the last 18 months.\"\nAt other beds, physiotherapists pumped chests, moved feet or arms while nurses dabbed ice lollies around the mouths of patients.\nNaomi Dalzell, a specialist respiratory ICU physio, said: \"These patients are often ventilated for four, five or six weeks or even more than that. \n\"They lose a significant amount of muscle strength while they are here. We start the rehab as early as we can [but] there's a long road ahead.\"\nJanette Ancog was among dozens who have been re-deployed to ICU, having usually worked as a nurse at Musgrave Park Hospital.\n\"It will be scary thinking ahead if the surge will go high again,\" she said, \"but we will just get through with it - we are here for each other.\"\nThe onslaught of another gruelling winter was also at the forefront of Emma Cody's mind.\nShe had just finished another challenging 12-hour nursing night shift and described the anxiety as \"immense\".\n\"I don't know how we are going to keep going at this level,\" she said. \"It's not sustainable. The burnout is immense. \n\"Everybody hits a breaking point and a lot of people have, and a lot of people will, still hit that.

      "text": "The government has confirmed a one-year suspension of the \"triple lock\" formula for annual state pension increases.\nThe move follows government concern that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have meant pensions increasing by 8%.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the average earnings component would be disregarded in the 2022-23 financial year.\nInstead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%.\n\"Tomorrow, I will introduce a Social Security Uprating and Benefits Bill for 2022-23 only,\" she told the Commons.\n\"It will ensure the basic and new state pensions increase by 2.5% or in line with inflation, which is expected to be the higher figure this year, and as happened last year, it will again set aside the earnings element for 2022-23 before being restored for the remainder of this Parliament.\" \nMs Coffey said the figures had been \"skewed and distorted\" by the average earnings rise, which she described as a \"statistical anomaly\".\nShe said the change meant that pensions would still rise, but less quickly. The triple lock would return the following year, she added. \nUnder the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater.\nThe Work and Pensions secretary said she was \"anticipating an unusual change in earnings\" due to the pandemic. \nShe added that earnings between May and July were expected to rise by more than 8%, so a one-year adjustment was needed. \nLast month, the Bank of England said it was expecting inflation to peak at 4%.\nThe Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to maintain the triple lock formula.\nMs Coffey's announcement came just hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson breached another manifesto commitment by increasing National Insurance to fund health and social care.\nAge UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \"If suspending the triple lock for a single year helps get a government deal on social care over the line, then I believe it's a price worth paying, but only if it really is just a one-off measure and not a sneaky way for ministers to ditch the triple lock altogether.\"\nMs Abrahams said that with more than two million pensioners currently living in poverty, there was \"a strong case\" for keeping the triple lock untouched.\nShe added that it was \"imperative that the triple lock reverts to normal next year, to help all those pensioners on low and modest incomes who desperately need it\".\nThe one-year break in the usual calculations for increases in the state pension was widely expected. \nThere is, after all, near-universal agreement that the average annual earnings rise (one leg of the so-called triple lock) will be an anomaly caused by the economic effect of Covid. \nCharities representing the elderly will hold the government to its commitment that this is just a temporary arrangement.\nTheir fear is that the government might be tempted to do the same again - potentially reducing rises in a state pension which is already low when compared with elsewhere in the Western world.\nOthers will consider this as a missed opportunity to reform the universal triple lock system, even though its existence is a Conservative manifesto promise for the rest of this Parliament.

Mr Johnson says the plan is \"reasonable and fair\", but it has been met with criticism that it will not address current problems.\nIndia administered more than 180 million doses of the Covid jab last month as it ramps up its vaccination drive to head off a third coronavirus wave. That's more doses than all the G7 countries - Canada, the UK, the US, Italy, Germany, France and Japan - put together, according to an official statement. The government aims to vaccinate all eligible Indians by the end of 2021.\nMaura McGoldrick is double-jabbed but she can't get an accurate vaccination certificate because she had her first Covid dose in London and her second in Glasgow. There's an issue with data-sharing across health services so her vaccination record only shows her as having received one dose. The Scottish government says it's working to \"align\" data from across the UK but the 21-year-old fears others may be in a similar situation. Read her story here.\nWith current levels of demand, GPs say they cannot imagine returning to normal face-to-face appointments. It's a top priority in the government NHS Recovery Plan, but surgeries are seeing unprecedented pressure to catch up with patients. Take a look at what some doctors and patients think.\nPeople on universal credit were given the additional \u00a320 per week \"uplift\"  by the government in response to the pandemic. That payment will soon end despite an appeal by some MPs to make the increase permanent. Find out what the extra \u00a320 means for three people who share their fears, and the choices they face, once it ends.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nRecord numbers of 18-year-olds have accepted university places this year so what will the new term be like, given many restrictions have been lifted?

      "tags": "France,November 2015 Paris attacks,Islamic State group",
      "text": "The only surviving member of the group suspected of being behind the 2015 Paris attacks says he and his fellow accused are \"being treated like dogs\". \nSalah Abdeslam and 19 other defendants are being tried in Paris over the attacks which left 130 dead. \nThe trial, which is expected to last nine months, began on Wednesday. \nThe shooting and bombing assault by Islamic State (IS) group extremists was the worst post-World War Two attack in France. \nFrench media report that Abdeslam shouted from the dock, saying he had not complained in the past because he would be \"resurrected\" after death. \n\"You should treat us like human beings,\" BFMTV quoted him as saying. \nCries of \"What about us? There were 130 deaths\" were heard in response from the courtroom. \nShortly after, the judge reminded Abdeslam that he was not in an \"ecclesiastical court but a democratic court\".\nAbdeslam also told the court: \"I gave up my job to become an Islamic State soldier.\" \nVictor Edou, a lawyer for eight survivors from the Bataclan attack, said some of his clients were \"not doing too well\" after hearing Abdeslam's remarks. \n\"It's going to be like that for nine months,\" he added. \nThe trial is being described as the biggest in France's modern history.\nThere will be more than 140 days of hearings involving about 330 lawyers, 300 victims and testimony from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who was French president when the attacks happened.\nAhead of the trial, Mr Hollande told French media that this was an important moment for the victims of the attacks, which he called an \"act of war\" at the time.\nIS admitted carrying out the co-ordinated attacks on the Bataclan concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars on 13 November 2015.\nThe suspects arrived at court in police vehicles under heavy security on Wednesday morning. They were seated together in the defendants' box, wearing face masks, before the trial opened.\nAsked by the court's top judge to identify himself, Abdeslam confirmed his name and said \"there is no god but Allah\" - an Islamic oath known as the Shahada.\nDay one of this monumental trial is over, with its mixture of confusion and solemnity, drama and tedium. At the start it was mayhem, as everyone milled around wondering where to go. But, at 13:00, the presiding judge entered the court and a stillness descended. I think at that point everyone drew a breath and understood the significance of the moment.\nThere were small excitements. Like when Salah Abdeslam - the key defendant - said that his profession was \"soldier of Islamic State\". And later there was a mini-confrontation when he complained about prison conditions, saying that it didn't matter because he knew that when he died he would be re-born, while for those facing him there would be a \"reckoning\".\nIs Salah Abdeslam shaping up to be the spokesman for the group in the dock? Is his bravado because he is insecure in his jihadist credentials? Remember, he failed in his apparent mission to blow himself up.\nAmid it all there was much of what accompanies all lengthy trials: long moments of not very much. The first two days will be taken up simply recording the names of all those hundreds of survivors and relatives who have registered as civil plaintiffs.\nThis will be the pattern. Periods of quiet punctuated by periods of high emotion. The trial for the events of 13 November 2015 will be both exhaustive and exhausting. \nAbdeslam's reference to being an IS soldier suggested he was still \"at war\", Jean-Pierre Albertini, whose son, Stephane, was killed in the Bataclan, told Reuters news agency.\nPhilippe Duperron also lost his son, Thomas, in the Bataclan attack. Mr Duperron said he had mixed feelings about the trial, not least impatience and anxiety.\n\"It will be the occasion for all the victims to bear witness, so it will be a very painful moment, and bring back the pain again,\" he said.\nAnother, Sophie Parra, told BFM TV she would testify at the trial despite her anxiety about facing the suspects in court.\nShe had had \"a lot of nightmares\" about \"all the possible scenarios\", she said, but felt it was something she had to do for those who were killed.\nOf the 20 suspects on trial, six are being tried in absentia. They are facing charges of murder, complicity and terrorist conspiracy.\nMost of the accused, including Abdeslam, could be sentenced to life in jail if convicted.\nAbdeslam, 31, is accused of providing logistical support to the assailants. Abdeslam fled the scene of the carnage after abandoning his suicide belt, which investigators later found to be defective.\nEurope's most-wanted man at the time, he was captured four months later in the Belgian capital, Brussels, after a shootout with police.\nAbdeslam has since refused to co-operate with French investigators. He remained largely silent throughout a separate trial in Belgium in 2018. There was much speculation about whether he would speak during this trial.\nThe area around the court was blocked off and armed police with dogs were on patrol ahead of the proceedings.\nThose attending the trial needed to pass through several checkpoints before being allowed into the specially built courtroom, which can seat hundreds.\nThe trial is being recorded for the archives but is not being broadcast live. Survivors and relatives of victims, known as civil plaintiffs in France, are able to follow along via streaming radio if they cannot attend.\nThe first days of the trial are expected to be largely procedural until victims are called to give testimony at the end of September. \nAbdeslam is the only surviving member of the group suspected of carrying out the attacks. He has been in jail since he was arrested in Belgium in 2016. \nThe 13 other defendants appearing in court are accused of a range of crimes, including financing and planning the attacks. On Wednesday, they also gave their names, addresses and professions.\nAmong them is Mohamed Abrini, who is accused of financing and supplying weapons to the attackers. The 36-year-old is due to stand trial over the 2016 Brussels bombings next year.\nOther suspects include Mohammed Amri, 33, and Hamza Attouh, 27, who were arrested in Belgium and admitted picking up Abdeslam in France and driving him back to Brussels immediately after the attacks.\nSix more are accused of helping organise the attacks and will be tried in absentia. Several of them are thought to be dead. They can be tried in absentia because they have never officially been declared dead."

      "title": "Government to shorten HGV driver testing process",
      "tags": "Global supply chain management,Freight transport,Haulage",
      "text": "The government is expected to announce a shake-up of the HGV driver testing process as soon as Thursday.\nIt wants to fast track drivers into the haulage industry amid chronic shortages which have caused supply problems.  \nThe BBC understands that during meetings between government officials, hauliers and suppliers, the \"penny finally dropped\" that the driver shortage was getting worse not better.\nThe government said meetings with affected groups were ongoing.\nIt added any change in policy would be announced in due course.  \nWidespread supply chain issues caused by the driver shortage have hit a range of sectors, including food, drink and medicines. \n\"The government seem to finally understand the scale of the problem. For the first time they looked rattled\", industry sources told the BBC.  \nIt's thought the centrepiece of the proposals could include combining the Class C test used for rigid lorries and Class E for larger articulated lorries into a single test. \nCurrently, there is usually a 2-3 week minimum period between taking the two tests.   \nThe haulage industry said a perfect storm of a post-Brexit exodus of drivers, an ageing and retiring workforce and COVID-related delays to testing new drivers had brought some supply chains to breaking point.\nHaulage firms, desperate for drivers to fill lorries left idle and to complete orders left unfulfilled, welcomed the move but warned that it would not be enough to fix the cracks appearing in supply chains.\nThey reiterated their calls for HGV drivers to be added to the Shortage Occupation List which would allow firms to temporarily bring back some of the estimated 20,000 EU drivers who have left the industry. \nPaul Jackson of Chiltern Distribution said: \"This is a sensible move but it's not enough to fix the problem. \n\"We don't put newly qualified drivers straight behind the wheel on their own. We buddy them up with experienced drivers for the first 8-10 weeks and the insurance costs for new drivers are also much higher. \n\"We desperately need to put HGV drivers on the list of skilled workers we can bring in from abroad.\"\nThe Chemical Business Association, which represents chemical firms within the supply chain, reiterated concerns that its members were struggling to get chemicals to water companies.\nTim Doggett, its chief executive, said: \"The supply chain situation in the UK is deteriorating.\" \nA survey conducted by the industry group suggests 96% of member companies are now experiencing issues with UK haulage, up from 63% in its last survey in June.\nThe Chemical Business Association has written to ministers warning about the effects of driver shortages.\nThe group write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June, saying that \"there was a contingent risk to the supply of chemicals into vital areas such as water treatment, which would be critical to the health and wellbeing of the population\".\nThe government is expected to say that the new regime will mean up to 3,000 new drivers can be tested per week. \nCurrently the pass rate is 56% so that would mean an extra 1,600 drivers per week. \nBut Richard Burnett of the Road Haulage Association said the industry was losing 600 drivers a week from the industry and with a net shortfall of 90,000 drivers, it would take nearly two years to fill the gap.  \nThe industry was already reporting shortages of about 60,000 drivers before Brexit and the pandemic. \nEven allowing for that, he said there was no way to plug the recent gaps in time for Christmas - when the UK is more reliant on EU food imports.  \nIn addition, the RHA said the onset of winter weather would throw up obstacles. \"The reality is that an industry already struggling to meet delivery schedules will be brought to its knees at the first outbreak of bad weather conditions.\" \nThe managing director of BJS Distribution Storage and Couriers, Harinder Singh, said the new shorter test was \"not a solution it is a risk\".\n\"Making the test easier does not make better drivers. The solution to the current shortage is to allow temporary visas to drivers from countries that understand the legislation and legal driving parameters of the UK, otherwise this isn't going to solve itself. \n\"By making the test easier you are putting more risk onto the road,\" he added.

      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund",
      "text": "Dozens of women in Kabul and the north-eastern Afghan province of Badakhshan have protested against the formation of an all-male interim Taliban government to rule Afghanistan.\nDemonstrators said they would not accept a government with no women ministers.\nSome women were reportedly beaten before the protests were dispersed.\nLocal news organisation Etilaatroz said some of its journalists were detained and beaten for covering the rally.\nThe Taliban, who have not responded to the allegations, warned that such protests were illegal.\nThey have said protesters needed permission to march, and should not use what they called abusive language.\nOn Tuesday, three people were killed during a demonstration in the western city of Herat. \nThe EU said the Islamist group had reneged on promises to make their government \"inclusive and representative\", while the US also expressed concern that the interim government includes figures linked to attacks on US forces.\nAddressing reporters after a virtual meeting of 20 Western nations on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Taliban's government \"certainly does not meet the test of inclusivity, and it includes people who have very challenging track records\".\n\"The Taliban seek international legitimacy and support - any legitimacy, any support, will have to be earned,\" he said.\nBut China said on Wednesday that it welcomed the end of what it called \"three weeks of anarchy\" in Afghanistan, and pledged $31m (\u00a322m) in immediate aid.\nThe formation of an interim government, China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters, is \"a necessary step to restore order and rebuild the country\".\nThe anti-Taliban National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF) have urged the international community not to recognise the new government, calling the cabinet \"illegal\" and \"a clear sign of the group's enmity with the Afghan people\".\nThe NRF, led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of the late resistance icon Ahmad Shah Massoud, have been fighting Taliban militants in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, which was Afghanistan's last anti-Taliban stronghold.\nThe Taliban insist they have now defeated the NRF in Panjshir, but NRF leaders say they are still fighting.\nOn Tuesday the Taliban announced the first appointments to their interim cabinet, which will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund. \nHassan Akhund served as foreign minister, and then later deputy prime minister, when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Like many of the new cabinet ministers he is under UN sanctions for his position in that government.\nSpeaking to Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera on Wednesday, Hassan Akhund said former Afghan officials should return to the country and that their security and safety would be guaranteed.\nHe said Taliban leaders face great responsibility towards the Afghan people, adding: \"We have suffered heavy losses for this historical moment and the era of bloodshed in Afghanistan is over.\"\nAnother incoming minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is head of the notorious Haqqani network.\nThe Haqqani network has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) by the US. It also maintains close ties to al-Qaeda.\nThe FBI says Haqqani was behind some of the deadliest attacks of the 20-year-long war, including a truck bomb explosion in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people.\nHe is wanted by the FBI over a 2008 attack on a hotel that killed an American. \nThe Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in a sweeping offensive more than three weeks ago. They now face many tough challenges in the conflict-torn country, including stabilising the economy and gaining international recognition.\nEarlier on Tuesday, a statement attributed to Taliban Supreme Leader Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada told the government to uphold Sharia law - Islam's legal system. The Taliban have been known for their extremely hardline interpretation of Sharia.\nThe Taliban want \"strong and healthy\" relations with other countries and would respect international laws and treaties as long as they did not conflict with \"Islamic law and the country's national values\", the statement said.\nHassan Akhund, the new interim prime minister, is influential on the religious side of the movement, rather than the military side.\nHis appointment is seen as a compromise, after recent reports of in-fighting between some relatively moderate Taliban figures and their hardline colleagues.\nA movement which has long moved in the shadows, whose names would surface only on the world's terrorism watch lists, is now announcing titles used in governments the world over. \nActing prime minister Mullah Akhund appears as a compromise candidate after reported rivalries among leading military and political figures who will serve under him. \nIts caretaker nature also provides breathing space as the Taliban move from guns to government. \nIt also underlines the Taliban view that a Taliban victory can only mean Taliban rule. Sources say they pushed back against calls for an \"inclusive\" government. They balked at including former political figures and officials, who've had their turn at the top, and especially those tainted by corruption. \n\"Why should we let others pick our cabinet when other countries pick their own? \"was one retort. \nAs for women, there was never a chance they would be given a ministerial role; the ministry of women's affairs seems to have been, for now, abolished altogether.  \nOther appointments to the new government include:"

      "tags": "Tax,Boris Johnson,Social care",
      "text": "A new health and social care tax will be introduced across the UK to pay for reforms to the care sector and NHS funding in England.\nBoris Johnson said it would raise \u00a312bn a year, designed to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and to bolster social care.\nHe accepted the tax broke a manifesto pledge, but said the \"global pandemic was in no-one's manifesto\".\nHowever, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a \"sticking plaster\".\nLeaders in social care also warned the money was \"nowhere near enough\" and would not address current problems.\nThe tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from April 2022, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip.\nThis will be paid by all working adults, including older workers, and the government says it will be \"legally ring-fenced\" to go only towards health and social care costs.\nIncome from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the latest tax increases amounted to \u00a314bn. Together with those announced in the March Budget, it said, 2022 had seen the highest tax rises in 40 years.\nThe UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional \u00a32.2bn to spend on their services. \nThe SNP said the tax would \"unfairly penalise Scottish families - and leave the poorest in society subsidising the wealthy\".\nMPs will vote on the new proposals in the Commons on Wednesday. \nMr Johnson said the proceeds from the tax would lead to \u00a312bn a year being raised, with the majority going into catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations.\nA portion of the money - \u00a35.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nA cap will be introduced on care costs in England from October 2023 of \u00a386,000 over a person's lifetime.\nAll people with assets worth less than \u00a320,000 will then have their care fully covered by the state, and those who have between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 in assets will see their care costs subsidised.\nJune Clay, 92, from Hornchurch, had to go into a nursing home four years ago.\nAs a property owner, June had to \"self-fund\", so sold her house to afford fees which over four years have risen to nearly \u00a31,200 a week.\nHer capital is almost all gone. The local authority will help, but only up to \u00a3640 a week - while the cheapest homes locally charge \u00a3900.\nNow her children, in their 60s, are considering re-mortgaging their own homes and using their pension savings to pay for her care.\n\"I made a promise to my mum, that she would stay in that home... I'm worried sick about it,\" says daughter Sharon.\nBut she fears the reforms will be \"smoke and mirrors\" that will not meet the full costs of care.\nMr Johnson insisted that with the new tax, \"everyone will contribute according to their means\", adding: \"You can't fix the Covid backlogs without giving the NHS the money it needs.\n\"You can't fix the NHS without fixing social care. You can't fix social care without removing the fear of losing everything to pay for social care, and you can't fix health and social care without long-term reform.\"\nBut Labour's Sir Keir said the new tax broke the Conservatives' pledge at the last election not to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. \nHe also said the rise would target young people, supermarket workers and nurses, rather than those with the \"broadest shoulders\" who should pay more. \nThe Labour leader added: \"Read my lips - the Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax.\"\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey - who is a carer himself - also said the tax was \"unfair\", and that the government's plan missed out solutions for staffing shortages, care for working age adults and unpaid family carers. \nMr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes - but he defended the move as \"the right, reasonable and fair approach\" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of \u00a3407bn on support. \nLater, during a press conference, the prime minister said he didn't want to raise taxes further but did not promise there would be no further rises before the next election - despite being asked repeatedly to rule it out. \nMeanwhile, the government has also announced it will suspend the so-called \"triple lock\" on pensions for one year following concerns that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have led to pensions increasing by 8%.\nThe government is raising about \u00a312bn a year for three years with these tax rises. \nJust over \u00a32bn of that goes to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under rules on how UK government spending is split. \nThat leaves \u00a310bn a year for health and social care in England. Most, but not all, of that has been earmarked against particular parts of health and social care. \nAbout \u00a36bn a year has been earmarked for the NHS. \nAnother nearly \u00a32bn a year will go to social care. \nA bit less than half of that will go towards the new funding model (helping people to pay for care) and a bit more than half going on delivering care - training for staff, support for councils and work on making the care and health services work better together. \nSome of the remainder will be spent on tax. The Department of Health and Social Care, and the NHS, are big employers and so a tax rise for employers will mean they have to pay more. \nBut there's still at least a \u00a31bn increase in the DHSC budget that goes into \"other\", with the government saying they'll announce further details in the coming weeks. \nAhead of the announcement, there was a backlash from number of Tory MPs, who said they were against a rise in National Insurance.\nBut questioning the PM after his statement in the Commons, many backbenchers instead sought reassurance that the money raised from the new tax would definitely go towards social care. \nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's World At One that he thought the government had listened to concerns about only making changes to National Insurance, especially as it would \"disproportionately target younger people\" and not pensioners.\nHe said: \"This new tax is more broadly based and the 10% of pensioners who work will pay it as well.\"\nHowever, there was anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised as a result of the tax. \nChief executive of the UK Home Care Association, Dr Jane Townson, said: \"This is nowhere near enough. It will not address current issues and some measures may create new risks.\"\nChairman of the Independent Care Group, Mike Padgham, said it was a \"huge opportunity missed for radical, once-in-a-generation reform of the social care system\", adding it would not address the staffing crisis which was \"sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts\".\nAnd the general secretary of the Unison union, Christina McAnea, said: \"A detailed plan is needed first to mend and future-proof a sector broken by years of neglect. \n\"Only then will the cost of making good the damage become clear.\" \nThe sums are eye-watering, but they've still left health and care bosses disappointed.\nThe Covid pandemic has had a huge toll on the NHS, requiring an overhaul of how services are run and creating a growing backlog in care.\nEven with this money, it will take the health service years to catch up.\nPart of the reason for that is that despite the headline figure of \u00a336bn over three years, by the time the money is shared out across the four UK nations and social care takes a chunk, the frontline of the NHS in England is left with little more than half the \u00a310bn a year health bosses were asking for.\nCouncils are perhaps even more disappointed. \nThe case for social care predates the pandemic. Governments have been dodging it since the late 1990s so the fact that changes are on the way is being welcomed.\nBut the cap only solves one part of the problem - protecting people's assets when they face catastrophic costs.\nYou will still need to be eligible for care to benefit from the cap. Access is rationed so only the most frail qualify - currently half of requests for help are turned down.\nCouncils say the money will do little to help them tackle this."

      "text": "There are currently no plans for a firebreak lockdown in Wales this autumn, the Welsh government has said.\nThe number of hospital patients with Covid-19 is climbing in Wales.\nThe latest figures from Digital Health and Care Wales show the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in hospital beds has risen by 76% in a week.\nOn Monday the UK government denied newspaper reports it was planning an October lockdown in England.\nLast October, people were told to stay at home and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops were ordered to close Wales entered a 17-day firebreak lockdown.\nBut asked whether it had plans for a similar move this year, the Welsh government said: \"There are no plans for a firebreak in Wales.\"\nIt said it was continuing to closely monitor the public health situation and review the coronavirus regulations every three weeks. \n\"Coronavirus has not gone away and we would encourage everyone to continue to take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones, including taking up the offer of a vaccine if they have not had one yet,\" a spokesperson added. \nTeaching union UCAC said the \"wise use of a firebreak\" was one of the possible measures that could be implemented \"if the data about cases and infection rates justify that\".\nIts general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast: \"Although everybody is keen to avoid any further disruption to face-to-face education, of course the judicious use of firebreaks is one of the possible measures that could be implemented - if the data about cases and infection rates were to justify it.\"\nHe said data on cases and infection rates in schools must be \"collected, analysed and published regularly to ensure the correct decisions are made as regards the suitable level of measures required\". \nOn Tuesday, Ceredigion council's leader said a potential October firebreak lockdown could be considered. \nEllen ap Gwynn told her cabinet she had been in an earlier national meeting with education officers and union members, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nShe told them: \"The numbers are increasing everywhere and everyone is concerned once again about how things will be - there might be a firebreak lockdown over half term but that's not confirmed yet at all.\"\nShe added there were already cases \"coming through our schools\" with 27 over the weekend. \nMeanwhile, critical care consultant David Hepburn, from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, said on Twitter the hospital's intensive care unit was at over 50% capacity. \n\"This is a similar pattern to last year - long slow increase in numbers which bodes very badly for the rest of the winter,\" he added. \nThere were 50 patients with Covid on critical care or on ventilation on as of Wednesday, the highest figure since 2 March this year.\nPublic Health Wales reported 10 more deaths on Wednesday. There have been 21 deaths in the past seven days, meaning 5,712 people in Wales have died with Covid-19.\nThe number of people in Wales vaccinated with the first dose has risen to 2,363,623 (74.53% of the total population), while 2,194,075 (69.2%) have been fully vaccinated."

      "text": "Rents outside London are soaring at their fastest rate in more than a decade, according to a property website.\nZoopla said private rental prices across the UK increased by 5% in the 12 months to the end of July - adding \u00a3456 a year to the average tenant's bill.\nThe 5% jump is the biggest recorded since Zoopla's index started in 2008.\nThe firm said it was down to increased demand for city living amid limited supply.\nAs lockdown restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened in city centres, there has been a marked return to more built-up areas, it said.\nIn August, the stock of property available to rent outside the capital was about a third below typical levels, while supply was already under pressure.\nAs a result, average rents for the UK, excluding London, stand at \u00a3790 per month, up from \u00a3752 a year ago.\nZoopla's head of research, Grainne Gilmore, said: \"The strong levels of rental demand seen across the UK during August will moderate in line with seasonal trends, but overall demand for rental property is likely to remain higher than usual in the coming months, amid this swing back to city life.\"\nShe cautioned that the market would be likely to depend on the path of the Covid-19 virus and any potential lockdown restrictions being re-introduced.\n\"But given no deviation from the current landscape, the demand for rental property, coupled with lower levels of supply, will continue to put upward pressure on rents,\" she added.\nInner cities across the UK, such as Edinburgh, have seen the highest growth in demand, although Zoopla's data showed London saw a decline of -3.8% in July on an annual basis.\nBut competition remains fierce for properties, the platform said, with rents now typically agreed within just 15 days of a property being listed.\nHalifax, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, recently said that while house prices hit a record high in August, the annual pace of growth in property values slowed.\nIt said, however, that the broader economic picture was positive, with high job vacancies and consumer confidence returning, which benefited the overall housing market. \nWhere can you afford to live in the UK - and is it cheaper to rent or buy?

      "text": "Audio of an Australian musk duck called Ripper saying what sounds like \"you bloody fool\" has been released by researchers.\nThe 34-year-old recording appears to be the first documented evidence of the species being able to mimic sounds. \nResearcher Dr Peter Fullagar recorded Ripper in 1987 at the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve near Canberra.\nBut his recordings were only recently rediscovered by Prof Carel ten Cate of Leiden University in the Netherlands.\nProf ten Cate had been researching vocal learning in birds when he came across a mysterious reference to a talking musk duck who could imitate other sounds, such as a slamming door.\n\"This came as a big surprise ... it remained unnoticed by researchers in the vocal learning field until now,\" Prof ten Cate told the university website.\n\"That makes it a very special rediscovery.\"\nMimicking sounds is a rare characteristic. There is evidence of vocal learning in dolphins, whales, elephants and bats, but it does not appear to be in the nature of most mammals. \nHowever, some birds - most famously parrots - can mimic sound.\n\"Although also for this group, vocal learning is rare,\" Prof ten Cate said. \n\"We know that songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds can learn to make specific sounds. This includes many species, but that is because vocal learning originated in the ancestral species of these groups.\"\nResearchers previously assumed that vocal learning evolved in only three of the 35 orders of bird species, but thanks to Ripper, Prof ten Cate can now introduce a new order into the group.\n\"To observe vocal learning in such a group makes this find extra remarkable,\" he said.
