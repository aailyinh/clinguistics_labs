      "tags": "Australia",
      "text": "Former Australian Rugby League player Jarryd Hayne has been jailed for five years and nine months for sexually assaulting a woman in 2018.\nHayne, 33, was found guilty in March of attacking the 26-year-old woman in her house.\nHe must serve at least three years and eight months before being eligible for parole.\nThe woman told the court in Newcastle, north of Sydney, she had been damaged by the attack \"but I'm still standing\".\n\"I felt dirty and violated. He made me feel like an object and was looking straight through me,\" she said in a victim impact statement on Thursday.\nIn previous hearings, prosecutors said Hayne had assaulted the woman in her bedroom, causing two injuries. The victim's mother was also at the Newcastle home at the time and Hayne left afterwards in a taxi, the court heard.\nOn Friday Hayne launched an appeal against his conviction.\nThe former National Rugby League (NRL) player insisted that all sexual activity had been consensual and that the injuries had been accidental.\nBut at Thursday's sentencing hearing, District Court Judge Helen Syme said Hayne had been \"fully aware that the victim was not consenting and went ahead anyway\".\n\"The reliability and honesty of the victim's evidence was tested at length and in my view, her reliability was not in doubt. She said no several times,\" the judge said, quoted by broadcaster ABC.\nHayne's sentence means he must serve at least three years and eight months before being eligible for parole.\nHe was one of the NRL's most high-profile athletes and twice won the player of the year award. He played 11 Tests for Australia, helping them to win the 2013 World Cup.\nHayne also had a brief career playing in the NFL in the US with the San Francisco 49ers, where he also faced sexual assault accusations.\nIn 2019, he settled a civil case concerning sexual assault allegations from a woman in California in 2015. Hayne strongly denied those allegations and privately settled the matter.\nHis case in Australia has been closely watched in recent months amid an intensifying national debate about rape and sexual misconduct.\nIn March thousands of people took part in marches across the country, protesting against the sexual abuse and harassment of women."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "PayPal,Twitter",
      "text": "Twitter has launched a new \"tip jar\" feature that lets people send money to others on the social network.\nThe company says the feature is \"an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation\".\nTo begin with, only a select group of people can receive tips - a group Twitter said was made up of \"creators\", journalists, experts, and non-profits.\nBut the feature has also been criticised for exposing personal information such as email addresses.\nThe tip jar function essentially adds a small icon to a user's profile - on mobile devices only for now - with a drop-down menu for other payment providers such as PayPal, Venmo, or the Cash App, the latter two of which are popular in the United States. \nBut because the payment is made through those external systems, some Twitter users noticed that tipping a PayPal account lets the recipient know the postal address of the tip sender.\nIn other cases, the recipient's email address could be seen, whether or not any money was sent. \nAfter security expert Rachel Tobac highlighted the issue, Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour thanked her for the \"good catch\" - but said Twitter could not control how PayPal handled that information.\nInstead, Twitter said it was updating the information around the tip jar to make clear that some details might be shared.\nPayPal, meanwhile, said the issue arose because the Twitter tip jar was using its \"goods and services\" payment option - which shares details for shipping those goods. It said people can toggle to the \"friends and family\" option during payment to avoid the issue.\nThe tip jar function also has support for Bandcamp - widely used by musicians - and Patreon, used by all sorts of independent digital creators such as YouTubers and podcasters.\nTwitter says the addition was inspired by people who added payment links or Patreon ads in replies to viral tweets.\n\"We $ee you - sharing your PayPal link after your Tweet goes viral, adding your $Cashtag to your profile so people can support your work, dropping your Venmo handle on your birthday or if you just need some extra help,\" wrote Twitter's senior product manager Esther Crawford in the blog post announcing the feature.\nIt said more people would be able to add the function to their profile \"soon\".\nBut there are some concerns about the way the function will be used.\nJournalists, in particular, are often banned from accepting gifts - and it's not clear how \"tips\" will be treated by news organisations.\n\"Seems like Twitter's tip jar feature is going to raise some issues for newsrooms,\" tweeted Ryan Lizza, Politico's Washington correspondent.\n\"Should reporters at your favourite [publications] and networks be allowed to accept money from anyone on the internet?\" he asked.\nAnother reporter writing for a US-based newspaper wrote: \"On the one hand... seems ripe for creating unethical situations.\n\"On the other hand... I don't make a lot of money and it's a tough world out there.\"\nThe tip jar is the latest in a string of experiments from the social network, which has seen user growth slow in recent years.\nEarlier this month, it acquired Scroll, a subscription service that removes adverts from participating news websites - and announced it would be part of Twitter's upcoming subscription service.\nAs part of that deal, Twitter also pitched paying Twitter as a way of supporting journalism.\n\"As a Twitter subscriber, picture getting access to premium features where you can easily read articles from your favourite news outlet or a writer's newsletter from Revue, with a portion of your subscription going to the publishers and writers creating the content,\" it said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPublic health experts have recommended that a version of the Indian Covid variant found in the UK be declared a \"variant of concern\", the BBC has been told. It's believed more than 500 cases of the variant known as B.1.617.2 have been detected across England, which would represent a sharp rise from the 202 recorded in the UK by Public Health England (PHE) as of 28 April.\nIf you're desperate to get away on an overseas holiday, industry figures warn it could prove costly this year. Uncertainty over the relaxation of travel rules is making it hard for airlines to plan when to bring planes back into service which, combined with pent-up demand, means holiday prices are \"already going up\", according to Booking.com's Glenn Fogel.\nIt's recommended that pregnant women are given the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna jabs when they are vaccinated because there is more safety data available about these drugs. But the online booking system in England does not allow users to specify a vaccine, meaning some women are struggling to get their jab, Labour MP Stella Creasy says. Giuditta Fontana, 36, tells us the process is proving \"incredibly stressful\".\nPoor pupils have fallen further behind in maths as a result of the pandemic, according to research. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) study suggests primary-school pupils eligible for free school meals have fallen another month behind their classmates since the first lockdown. The government has made \u00a31.7bn in catch-up funding available in England.\nThe Netherlands might be struggling to control a third wave of coronavirus - but the Eurovision Song Contest venue in Rotterdam is nonetheless ready to welcome thousands of screaming fans later this month. Anna Holligan explains why.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\n...you can pick up free rapid Covid tests.

      "title": "Omicron: What Covid refund rights are there for holidays abroad?",
      "tags": "Companies,Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Money,Travel insurance,Personal finance,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers.\nQuarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November.\nIf the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there.\nFor example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant.\nIf your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher.\nAn airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. \nA package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days.\nThis is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund.\nIn this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have.\nEasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its \"freedom to change\" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022.\nSome may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive.\nThey may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund.\nThat may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given.\n\"If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,\" he said. \n\"Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead.\"\nPeople who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator.\nOperators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate.\nIt is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel.\nTravel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy.\nThe majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel.\nImportantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go.\nRules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries.\nThe government has published a charter that \"clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place\".\nIt says it expects travel operators to be \"flexible\" with customers, given the circumstances, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firms they must stick to refund rules.\n"

      "tags": "Fish,River Severn,Animals,Worcester",
      "text": "One of the UK's rarest fish is getting a chance to return to its historical breeding grounds on the River Severn.\nThe little-known twaite shad, a member of the herring family, was once common in British waters with thousands of the fish migrating upstream in spring.\nNumbers dwindled after weirs constructed in the 19th Century posed barriers to migratory fish. \nA conservation project is trying to unlock the river for fish by creating routes around several weirs. \nIt is hoped the move will benefit a host of species including salmon, lamprey and eels. \nThis month could see the return of the twaite shad to stretches of the river north of Worcester. \nVolunteers are being sought to listen out for the distinctive splashing sounds the fish make when they breed at night.\nJason Leach, programme director at the Canal & River Trust, said: \"It's never too late to give nature the chance to recover.\n\"Our project's night-time riverside spawning vigils are a fitting way to begin recording the recovery of the fish affected so badly when our predecessors inadvertently caused a big problem for migratory fish by the building of the weirs.\n\"We hope lots of volunteers will be inspired to join us to witness and record the spring shad-spawning phenomenon.\"\nThe Unlocking The Severn project by the Canal & River Trust, Severn Rivers Trust, Environment Agency and Natural England is in the process of reopening 150 miles (241km) of the river for the fish.\nTwo specially constructed passes beside Victorian-era weirs at Diglis and Bevere, near Worcester, have been completed.\nA study by Swansea University estimates that 99% of the UK's rivers are fragmented by barriers such as weirs, dams, hydropower structures and culverts.\nThe high number of barriers make it difficult for migratory fish to complete their journeys to reproduce and find food.\n\"If you imagine a fish that is 10cm long, then a barrier that is even under 50cm high is going to prevent that fish from moving up and down the river to different bits of habitat where it might feed or spawn,\" said researcher Dr Joshua Jones."

      "title": "Big Chinese rocket segment set to fall to Earth",
      "tags": "Space debris,Space exploration",
      "text": "Debris from a Chinese rocket is expected to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled re-entry this weekend.\nThe main segment from the Long March-5b vehicle was used to launch the first module of China's new space station last month.\nAt 18 tonnes it is one of the largest items in decades to have an undirected dive into the atmosphere.\nThe US on Thursday said it was watching the path of the object but currently had no plans to shoot it down.\n\"We're hopeful that it will land in a place where it won't harm anyone,\" US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. \"Hopefully in the ocean, or someplace like that.\"\nVarious space debris modelling experts are pointing to late Saturday or early Sunday (GMT) as the likely moment of re-entry. However, such projections are always highly uncertain.\nOriginally injected into an elliptical orbit approximately 160km by 375km above Earth's surface on 29 April, the Long March-5b core stage has been losing height ever since.\nJust how quickly the core's orbit will continue to decay will depend on the density of air it encounters at altitude and the amount of drag this produces. These details are poorly known.  \nMost of the vehicle should burn up when it makes its final plunge through the atmosphere, although there is always the possibility that metals with high melting points, and other resistant materials, could survive to the surface.\nWhen a similar core stage returned to Earth a year ago, piping assumed to be from the rocket was identified on the ground in Ivory Coast, Africa.\nThe chances of anyone actually being hit by a piece of space junk are very small, not least because so much of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean, and because that part which is land includes huge areas that are uninhabited.\nThe zone of potential fall in this case is restricted still further by the trajectory of the rocket stage. It's moving on an inclination to the equator of about 41.5 degrees. This means it's possible already to exclude that any debris could fall further north than approximately 41.5 degrees North latitude and further south than 41.5 degrees South latitude.\nChina has bridled at the suggestion that it has been negligent in allowing the uncontrolled return of so large an object. Commentary in the country's media has described Western reports about the potential hazards involved as \"hype\" and predicted the debris will likely fall somewhere in international waters. \nThe Global Times quoted aerospace expert Song Zhongping who added that China's space monitoring network would keep a close watch and take necessary measures should damage occur.\nBut the respected cataloguer of space activity, Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, US, said the situation did reflect poorly on China.  \n\"It is indeed seen as negligence,\" he told BBC News.\n\"This is the second launch of this rocket; the debris in Ivory Coast last year was from the previous launch, i.e. a basically identical rocket.  \n\"These two incidents [the one now and the Ivory Coast one] are the two largest objects deliberately left to re-enter uncontrolled since Skylab in 1979.\"\nFragments of the US space station Skylab scattered across Western Australia in 1979, attracting worldwide attention.  \nHugh Lewis, who models space debris at Southampton University, UK, noted that more than 60 years of spaceflight had left a large legacy of junk in orbit. The responsibility for this litter rests on several countries, but principally Russia and the US.\n\"It's worth remembering that there are approximately 900 orbital rocket stages in low-Earth orbit, left behind by nearly every launch-capable nation and with a combined mass orders of magnitude greater than the one expected to re-enter the atmosphere this [weekend],\" Dr Lewis posted on Twitter.\nModern practice now calls for rocket stages to be de-orbited as soon as possible after their mission. In the case of large core segments, these would normally come straight back, within one orbit, falling into the ocean or on land (the US company SpaceX now propulsively lands its core stages so they can be used again).\nFor upper-stages that go into an orbit and may travel around the globe several times as they precisely position a payload, the preference is to include a re-ignitable engine that can steer the stage into a return at the earliest opportunity.\nUsually, this would be over an ocean - potentially in the furthest place from land in the South Pacific, between Australia, New Zealand and South America.\nOver an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) this region is a popular graveyard of rocket elements and defunct satellites, where the remains of around 260 missions are thought to be scattered on the ocean floor.\nAdditional reporting by Andreas Illmer"

      "text": "A state of emergency has been extended in several regions of Japan as Covid-19 cases surge, less than three months before the Tokyo Olympics.\nRestrictions in Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto had been due to end on 11 May, but will now remain in place until the end of the month.\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga also said they had added Aichi and Fukuoka to the regions under a state of emergency.\nThe move casts more doubt on whether the Olympics will go ahead as planned.\nUnder the state of emergency, bars and restaurants have had to shut or stop serving alcohol, while cinemas and karaoke parlours have been closed.\nMr Suga said the government had hoped that a \"short and powerful\" state of emergency would contain the country's fourth wave of the virus.\nBut, he said, the number of new cases was still \"at a high level in major cities\", and \"hospitals continue to be overwhelmed\" in some areas.\nOsaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura also warned that his region's medical system was \"reaching breaking point\".\nIn one nursing home in Osaka 61 residents were infected with the virus, and 14 died while waiting to receive hospital treatment, broadcaster NHK reported.\nEarlier on Friday Yasutoshi Nishimura, the economy minister who is also in charge of Covid-19 measures, said variant strains of the virus were spreading rapidly.  \nHowever, local media report that some rules will still be eased, such as allowing a limited number of fans back into sports stadiums,  despite other restrictions being extended. \nThe Olympics are due to begin in Tokyo on 23 July. They were postponed from 2020 because of the pandemic.\nMore than 10,000 athletes from 200 countries and regions are due to take part.\nJapan's Games president Seiko Hashimoto said they would welcome a visit by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach this month, but that it would be very difficult to organise with the restrictions now having been extended."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Prime Minister has said the government needs to carefully handle outbreaks of the India variant of coronavirus in the UK.\nIt comes as Public Health England (PHE) said one version of it had been elevated to a \"variant of concern\".\nB.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly than two other identified subtypes of the Indian variant.\nScientists believe it is at least as transmissible as the variant first detected in Kent last year.\nBoris Johnson said the government needs to think \"very carefully\" about the public health response.\n\"We're doing a huge amount, obviously, to make sure that when we do find outbreaks of the Indian variant that we do surge testing, that we do door-to-door testing,\" he said.\nPHE said there was currently \"insufficient evidence\" to indicate that any of the variants recently detected in India cause more severe disease or make current vaccines any less effective. \nScientists are now carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of the mutations on the behaviour of the virus.\nViruses mutate all the time, producing different versions of themselves. Most of these mutations are insignificant - and some may even make the virus less dangerous - but others can make it more contagious and harder to vaccinate against.\nThe original India variant - officially known as B.1.617 - was first detected in October.\nThat version has now been re-characterised as three different subtypes, all with slightly different genetic mutations.\nThe UK has seen a sharp increase in one type in particular, known as B.1.617.2, which now makes up the majority of all Indian variant cases and appears to be growing faster than other versions. \nCases have increased from 202 to 520 in the last week, with most detected in London and the North West of England. \nAlmost half were related to travel or contact with a traveller but there have been examples of community transmission linked to work and religious gatherings. \nIn one cluster at a care home, 14 elderly residents who had all been vaccinated, were infected with the variant, a source told the BBC. A number needed hospital treatment, but not for severe disease, and it is thought all have now recovered.\nAll current vaccines are thought to offer some degree of protection against variants but can never completely stop all infections, especially among vulnerable or elderly people.\nIt is tempting to conclude that because there is now evidence this variant is more infectious and because cases have risen rapidly in the UK, this marks the start of the rise of this Indian variant.\nBut there are some good reasons why we should not jump to that conclusion.\nThe rapid rise in cases is being linked to an increase in international travel from India ahead of the country being put on the \"red list\".\nThere are some early signs in the data, Public Health England sources say, that the increase may be coming to an end, meaning that it may reflect that rise in travel rather than significant community spread.\nTwo key factors are in our favour - the vaccines appear to work just as well against this variant as the dominant virus circulating in the UK (although uptake in the Indian community is a little lower) plus there are still significant social distancing restrictions in place that should help to limit spread.\nLots of testing and contact tracing in different areas are taking place - and some surge testing is expected to be announced later in areas where there is most concern. \nIt will be a couple of weeks before we know for sure. The message is clear - this needs to be taken seriously, but there is no need to panic.\nPHE said extra surge testing was now being put in place in affected areas along with more targeted contact tracing to try and stop the spread of the variant. \nAll individuals living in specific postcodes will be asked to get a PCR test, even if they don't have symptoms. \nEnhanced testing is already being rolled out in parts of Bolton which has seen an increase in cases of B.1.617.2 in the last week. \nAnyone living, working or studying in the Rumworth, Deane or Great Lever areas is strongly urged to visit a mobile testing unit, whether they have symptoms or not. \n\"The way to limit the spread of all variants is the same and although we are all enjoying slightly more freedom, the virus is still with us,\" said Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at PHE.  \n\"We are monitoring all of these variants extremely closely and have taken the decision to classify this as a variant of concern because the indications are that it is more transmissible.\"\nLaboratory work is needed to sequence individual Covid tests and identify specific variants, meaning the latest figures are likely to represent the situation about a week ago.\nFigures from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which analyses positive swabs for different variants, also showed clusters of B.1.617.2 in places including Leicester, Bolton, Nottingham and Blackburn in the week to 24 April.\nIt comes as seven confirmed cases of the same variant have been detected in Northern Ireland - the first discovered in the region.\nIndia has said the B.1.617 variant may be linked to a deadly second coronavirus wave that has swept the country in recent weeks.\nThe country reported a record 412,000 cases in the space of 24 hours on Wednesday, and 3,980 deaths.\nThe surge in infections has already overwhelmed the healthcare system with hospital beds, oxygen and even crematorium space in short supply, while several states are under localised lockdowns and curfews.\nAdditional reporting by Ella Willis."

      "text": "Prices for international travel are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned.\nBooking.com's chief executive Glenn Fogel told the BBC that holiday \"prices are already going up\". \nMany airlines have significantly reduced the number of flights they operate due to travel restrictions.\nHowever, Tui's UK boss Andrew Flintham said it would be \"a long time\" before holiday firms try to boost profits.\nMr Fogel said that despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service.\n\"There's so much pent-up demand,\" said Mr Fogel. \"Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely.\"\nJohn Grant, an aviation analyst with global travel data provider OAG said this will have a knock-on impact on air fares as travel restrictions are eased. \n\"That will, in the short term, create a rush of pent-up demand and revenge spending,\" he said.\n\"In turn, the airline algorithms will detect an uptick in demand and move prices up accordingly\".\nThe government will shortly announce which foreign destinations holidaymakers from England can visit from 17 May without needing to quarantine on their return.\nAir fares to Portugal - which is expected to be on the green list - have already started to rise as airlines respond to higher demand.\nAccording to PA, British Airways is charging \u00a3530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on 17 May, compared with \u00a3276 two days earlier.\nA Ryanair flight from Stansted to Lisbon costs \u00a3262 on 19 May, PA found, more than double the price of \u00a3128 on 14 May.\nBut Tui's managing director for the UK and Ireland, Andrew Flintham, told BBC Breakfast travel firms were unlikely to push up prices anytime soon.\n\"Our prices are very, very stable. They're pretty much like for like, flat, year over year. There isn't a big increase in there.\n\"We've got plenty of holidays to sell. I think everybody in the industry has.\n\"It'll be a long time before the idea of trying to increase prices to make more money. We want to get people away on holiday, having a great time, because we think they genuinely all deserve it.\"\nA lack of clarity about how governments will go about recognising vaccine and testing statuses from other countries is troubling the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Fogel believes a single system would be helpful: \"So many different people in so many different governments are talking about different programmes, but right now, there is nothing out there that is unified, so it's very confusing. \n\"I listened to the prime minister of Italy saying how they want to let people into Italy soon and you just have to prove that you have a vaccine and it'd be great. \n\"And my thinking is, well, I have my vaccine myself, but how do I prove it? Do I just bring my little white card that I got in the US that said I got it, is that going to be good enough? We need some clarifications.\"\nSeveral systems are being explored, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA)'s travel pass, which is being trialled by a number of airlines.\nMeanwhile, the European Union is working on having a digital pass ready in time for the summer holidays.\nThe idea of a scheme that allows passengers who have had the vaccine to travel has proved divisive.  \nThe UK equality watchdog recently warned it could create a \"two-tier society, whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights\". \nThat's a view supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) but Mr Fogel disagrees.\n\"It's true that if you're not vaccinated, you may not be able to enter a country under this type of a system,\" he said.\n\"But I'm okay with that. Because the alternative is what - nobody gets to go in? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\" \nHe added that there are countries that people cannot go into if they don't have proof of vaccination against yellow fever, for example. \n\"There's nothing wrong with using technology to prove you are a safe traveller that can help get the industry up faster,\" said Mr Fogel.\nThe lack of clarity has hurt the finances of Booking.com's US owner Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak and rentalcars.com. \nRevenues for the three months to the end of March fell to $1.1bn (\u00a3790m) - 50% lower than the same period a year ago.\nFigures from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) reflect a similar picture across the industry, showing tourism's value to the global economy fell from nearly $9.2tn in 2019 to $4.7tn in 2020.  \nAs a share of the global economy that equates to a fall from 10.4% to just 5.5%.\nBut Mr Fogel, who is chief executive of both the Dutch-based Booking.com and its parent firm Booking Holdings, told investors that there is still reason to be optimistic things will improve.\n\"While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs,\" he said.\n\"In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is key to unlocking pent-up travel demand.\""

      "text": "Labour is losing ground to the Conservatives in elections across England, in the first big test of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of the party.\nThe first blow for Labour came when the Tories took a Westminster seat from it in the Hartlepool by-election.\nIt has also lost control of several councils, while the Conservatives have made gains. \nAnd the Tories won more than 70% of the mayoral vote in Tees Valley - an area that used to vote Labour.\nSir Keir said he was \"bitterly disappointed\", but pledged to lead a fightback for his party and to set out a \"bold vision\" in the next few days.\nMore than half the results from Thursday's English council elections have been announced.\nThe rest, as well as those for mayoral and police and crime commissioner contests, will continue to come in through over the weekend.\nAmong the details so far, the Conservatives have taken Pendle, Maidstone, Cornwall, Nottinghamshire, Basildon, Northumberland, Dudley, and Nuneaton and Bedworth councils from no overall control.\nThey also took control of of Harlow council, in Essex, from Labour.\nAnd Labour has lost Sheffield, Plymouth and Rossendale to no overall control.\nThe Green Party has increased its number of seats across England, while the Conservatives lost Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Wight to no overall control.\nConservative Ben Houchen was re-elected mayor of Tees Valley, which includes Hartlepool, receiving 73% of the vote. This involved a swing from Labour to his party of 23%.\nMr Houchen said there was \"pride returning\" to the area, adding that it was \"not true\" that the government had pumped lots of money into it over the past few years only because it was run by a Conservative.\nPolling expert Sir John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said \"what was once traditional Labour territory\" in north-eastern England had \"now been well and truly painted blue\".\nEngland is electing 143 councils, 13 mayors.\nIt is also choosing 35 police and crime commissioners, of which the Conservatives have so far gained three, for Dorset, Cleveland and Avon and Somerset.\nThe prime minister described results declared so far as \"very encouraging\" for the Conservatives.\n\"I think that's really because we have been focusing, as a government, on our priorities, the people's priorities, and bouncing back from the pandemic as much as we can and getting through it,\" he added.\nClick or tap to explore map\nSir Keir offered a stark assessment of Labour's performance, which follows its worst general election outcome since the 1930s in 2019.\nHe told the BBC the party, which he has led for just over a year, had \"lost the trust of working people, particularly in places like Hartlepool\", adding: \"We have not made a strong enough case to the country.\"\nHe said that he intended to take \"responsibility for fixing things\".\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the party under Sir Keir for \"offering nothing\" but \"insipid support for the government\".\n\"We have to make a very clear pitch for what real social justice would look like,\" he told Channel 4 News. \"You don't succeed in beating the government if you agree with their strategy.\"\nBut Labour has won some key votes, including in Doncaster, where Ros Jones was re-elected as mayor.\nIt has also retained control of councils including Liverpool, Manchester, Hastings and Exeter.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, whose party has lost a few seats with more than half of councils still to declare their results, said it was \"moving forwards and making progress\".\nReacting to the gain in seats in Cambridgeshire, he added: \"If you want to beat the Conservatives, it's the Liberal Democrats that can do it.\"\nEngland is seeing a bumper set of local council elections this year, after polls in 2020 were postponed due to the pandemic.\nIn Scotland, parliamentary results will give an indication of the public level of support for a second independence referendum, as proposed by the SNP.\nMeanwhile, Welsh Labour is aiming to remain the largest party in the Senedd, where it has held power since the parliament was founded in 1999."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

in London.\nThe English capital is where Black Obsidian Sound System (B.O.S.S.) are based, and they work across art, sound and radical activism.\nFormed by and for QTIBPOC (queer, trans and intersex black and people of colour), the group aims to challenge the perceived norms of sound-system culture across African communities In London - through club nights, art installations, technical workshops and a film documenting QTIBPOC nightlife.\nJudges praised their live performances - they've put on events at Somerset House - and \"their commitment to community\", including an online 24-hour fundraising rave.\nCooking Sections are the other London-based nominees and they examine the systems that organise the world through food. \nUsing installation, performance and video, they explore the overlapping boundaries between art, architecture, ecology and geopolitics. \nTurner Prize officials applauded the ingenuity of their long-term CLIMAVORE project, which asks questions about how our diet can respond to the climate emergency. \nThe duo put on a sound, light and sculpture installation at Tate Britain last year, reflecting on salmon farming, as well as an ongoing installation-performance on the Isle of Skye which sees an underwater oyster table turn into a community dining space at low tide.\nOver in the Cardiff, Gentle/Radical - made up of artists, community workers, performers, faith practitioners, writers and others - are advocating for art as a tool for social change.\nThey create real and virtual spaces for communities in Wales to engage with culture, such as the creation a pop-up cinema space showing independent films.\nTheir ongoing Doorstep Revolution helped people to share neighbourhood stories during lockdown. \nThe jury admired their \"deep commitment\" to the hyper-local community of their native Riverside.\nLast but not least, Project Art Works are a collective of neurodiverse artists and makers based in Hastings.\nNeurodiversity is defined as autistic or other neurologically atypical patterns of thought or behaviour.\nThey explore art through collaborative practice with, for and by neurominorities - and their work appears in exhibitions, events, films and online. \nTheir recent film, Illuminating the Wilderness, followed members of the collective and their families and carers exploring a remote Scottish glen.\nThe jury praised their continuing work at Hastings Contemporary, where passers-by could continue to view work in lockdown by looking through the windows of the closed gallery.\nAn exhibition of all five Turner Prize nominees work will be held at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry from 29 September until 12 January 2022, as part of the UK City of Culture 2021 celebrations.\nThe winner will be announced on 1 December.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Most adults under the age of 40 will be given an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to a link with rare blood clots. \nThe UK's medicines safety regulator says there have been 242 clotting cases and 49 deaths, with 28.5 million doses of the vaccine administered. \nBut the risk is slightly higher in younger age groups. \nLow levels of coronavirus cases and the availability of alternative vaccines have also informed the decision. \nProf Wei Shen Lim, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said they were putting \"a high priority on safety\" and he expected the move would \"serve to boost confidence\" in the vaccination programme. \nImmunisation is estimated to have already saved 10,000 lives in the UK.\nHe added: \"As Covid-19 rates continue to come under control, we are advising that adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine.\"\nIt comes as two-thirds of over-18s in the UK have now had a first dose - about 35 million people - and 31.8% or nearly 16.8 million have had both doses, according to the latest government figures.\nA further 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were reported on Friday, and there were 2,490 new confirmed cases.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to distinctive, but rare, blood clots that also appear with low levels of platelets (which help clots form) in the blood.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, but rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Two in a million people in their 40s died rising to four per million people in their 30s. \nAt the same time, the risks of developing severe Covid, if you catch the virus, fall in younger age groups. \nDr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said the benefits continued to outweigh the risks for the \"vast majority of people\".\nShe added: \"The balance of benefits and risks is very favourable for older people, but is more finely balanced for younger people.\"\nThe supply of alternative vaccines, including Pfizer and Moderna, has made the decision possible. \nThe vaccination programme has also been unexpectedly successful in reducing the spread of the virus. This has changed projections for a \"third wave\" later in the year meaning the risk to younger adults is less than previously anticipated.\nMost clots were after the first dose and people who have already had one dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca are advised to still have the second.\nHowever, some under 40s will still be offered the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as it is easier to both transport and store, making it more practical than the alternatives. \nAll adults are still expected to be offered their first dose of a vaccine by the end of July. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The United States has deployed extra military resources to protect American and coalition forces withdrawing from Afghanistan.\nHeavy bombers and fighter jets will be deployed to safeguard troops and civilian contractors. \nThe US and Nato have had a presence in Afghanistan for almost 20 years.\nUS President Joe Biden has set the withdrawal deadline for 11 September - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that sparked the war. \nBut the withdrawal comes amid escalating violence, with Afghan security forces on high alert for reprisal attacks.\nThe Taliban have warned they are no longer bound by an agreement not to target international troops.\nUnder a deal signed last year between the militants and then-President Donald Trump, foreign forces were to have left by 1 May while the Taliban held off attacking international troops.\nSix B-52 long range bombers and 12 F-18 fighters have been deployed to protect the departing contingents of 2,500 US service members and 16,000 civilian contractors, said Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nGeneral Milley added that while Taliban insurgents were launching between 80 and 120 attacks every day against Afghan government targets, there had been no attacks against US and coalition forces since the withdrawal began on 1 May. \n\"Less than one week in, the drawdown is going according to plan,\" Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters.\nOn 11 September 2001, attacks in America killed nearly 3,000 people. Osama Bin Laden, the head of Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, was quickly identified as the man responsible.\nThe Taliban, radical Islamists who ran Afghanistan and protected Bin Laden, refused to hand him over. So, a month after 9/11, the US launched air strikes against Afghanistan.\nAs other countries joined the war, the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But they didn't just disappear - their influence grew back and they dug in.\nSince then, the US and its allies have struggled to stop Afghanistan's government collapsing, and to end deadly attacks by the Taliban.\nThe withdrawal of US troops begins against a backdrop of fierce clashes between the Taliban and government forces, in the absence of a peace deal.\nLast week, a car bombing in Pul-e-Alam, Logar province, killed up to 30 people and wounded 110 - mostly school pupils.\nPresident Biden says the US pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure the country cannot again become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani says government forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay.\nBut many do not share the optimism, believing the withdrawal could plunge the country back to the dark days of the Taliban era."

      "tags": "Hartlepool by-election 2021",
      "text": "The Conservatives have beaten Labour in the Hartlepool by-election, with a Tory MP elected for the first time in the current constituency's history.\nTory candidate Jill Mortimer - who defeated Labour rival Paul Williams by nearly 7,000 votes - hailed the result as a \"truly historic\" moment. \nIt comes as a blow to Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to win back support in traditional Labour heartlands.\nThe Tories are also making gains from Labour in English council elections.\nOn a walkabout in Hartlepool with the victorious Tory candidate, Boris Johnson said her win was a \"mandate for us to continue to deliver\" for the north-east of England and the rest of the country.\n\"If there is a lesson out of this whole election campaign across the whole of the UK is that the public want us to get on with focusing on their needs and their priorities, coming through the pandemic and making sure we build back better,\" added the prime minister.\nSir Keir said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the results.\nThe Labour leader said the party had \"lost the trust of working people, particularly in places like Hartlepool,\" but added: \"I will take full responsibility for fixing things.\"\nHe said Labour had \"not made a strong enough case to the country\" and he promised to set out changes in the next few days to help the party \"reconnect\" with lost voters.\nThe Hartlepool constituency was formed in 1974 and had returned a Labour MP in every vote since - until Thursday's poll.\nMs Mortimer hailed it as a \"truly historic\" result, adding: \"Not only that, I am the first woman ever to be elected as MP for this town.\n\"Labour have taken people in Hartlepool for granted for too long.\n\"I heard this time and time again on the doorstep and people have had enough and now, through this result, the people have spoken and have made it clear it is time for change.\"\nDiane Abbott, an ally of Sir Keir Starmer's predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: \"Crushing defeat for Labour in Hartlepool. Not possible to blame Jeremy Corbyn for this result. Labour won the seat twice under his leadership. Keir Starmer must think again about his strategy.\"\nAnother Corbyn ally, union boss Len McCluskey, warned Labour faced a \"continuous downward decline\" unless Sir Keir started \"talking about the radical alternative for ordinary working people\".\n\"People don't know what his vision is. People don't know what Labour stand for anymore,\" said the Unite general secretary.\nHe told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast he did not trust Sir Keir and had not spoken to him since Mr Corbyn's expulsion from the Parliamentary party last year.\nMr Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, tweeted: \"With millions not voting, these results show a loss of hope.  \n\"We must offer a bolder vision to transform people's lives and give them the confidence to strive for a more equal world.\"\nBut key figures from the centrist wing of the party say the Hartlepool defeat, which saw a 16% swing from Labour to the Conservatives, showed Labour had not changed enough.\nLord Adonis, who served under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the party was in \"no man's land\" under Sir Keir, who he described as a \"transitional leader\".\nHe warned \"it could be curtains for Labour\" unless it became a \"modernising, centrist, dynamic\" party.\nAnd former Hartlepool MP Lord Mandelson said it was clear from his conversations with voters in the town that Mr Corbyn was \"still casting a very dark cloud over Labour\" and that the party had more work to do put that era behind it.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Hartlepool defeat was down to \"two Cs: Covid and Corbyn\".\nLabour's loss of Hartlepool in a by-election is the most dramatic illustration yet that the party has so far failed to connect with the Leave-supporting, working class voters they lost heavily in 2017 and 2019. \nSupport for the Brexit Party, which registered 26% in Hartlepool in 2019, collapsed - the successor Reform party secured just 1% of the vote. \nIt looks as though the Conservatives picked up the Brexit Party's former support, in line with the proportion of Leave voters preferring the Conservatives to Labour to the order of 3/4 to 1.\nHowever, the swing to the Conservatives of 16% is more than can be accounted for by the collapse of the Brexit Party. \nLabour's vote fell 9 points to 29%, so the party clearly lost some of its 2019 support, as well as suffering from the movement of Brexit Party voters to the Conservatives. \nPart of the explanation may lie in the success of independent candidate, Sam Lee, who won 10% of the vote.\nTogether with the pattern in key wards there is clearly a debate about whether Labour can win support from Leave voters by ignoring Brexit as it has in the past 12 months. \nThe Conservative gain of Northumberland council is a further illustration of the success of the Conservatives in Leave voting areas. \nConservative Ms Mortimer won with 15,529 votes, while Labour's Mr Williams received 8,589.\nThe Hartlepool seat came back into contention after its former Labour MP, Mike Hill, resigned in March.\nThe by-election was one of a raft of elections taking place across Britain on Thursday, with voters picking representatives for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd, as well as mayors and local councils in England, and police and crime commissioners.\nThe result is more evidence of the long term shift in politics where areas that had chosen Labour for decades were less and less convinced.\nThat didn't start with Boris Johnson and didn't even start with Brexit.\nThe success of the vaccine programme has no doubt helped the Tories.\nBut Keir Starmer has questions to answer as well."

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Our Planet Now,Carbon dioxide,Greenhouse gas monitoring,COP26,Paris climate agreement,United Nations,Climate change,Natural gas",
      "text": "Reducing emissions of methane gas is vital for tackling climate change in the short-term, a major UN report says.\nMethane is produced when living things decompose; it's also in natural gas.\nIt persists for just a short time in the atmosphere - unlike carbon dioxide - but methane is a much more potent global warming gas than CO2.\nThe report says \"urgent steps\" are necessary in order to reduce methane if global warming is to be kept within a limit laid down in the Paris deal.\nThis agreement, signed by 200 countries, aims to keep the global temperature rise to within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century.\nThe 1.5C target is regarded as the gateway to \"dangerous\" warming, where the planet could experience serious adverse effects of climate change.\nThe report comes as data showed both CO2 and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere reached record highs last year.\nThis happened despite pandemic lockdowns, which massively reduced economic activity.\nThe good news is that the UN report says rapid and significant reductions in the greenhouse gas are possible using existing technologies and a very low cost.\nMethane is also a source for another gas - ozone - in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere (known as the troposphere)\nIn addition to saving money, cutting methane would yield significant health benefits by reducing the amount of ground-level ozone - a pollutant that's harmful to the human body.\nThe recommendations come from an international team of scientists, who have produced the Global Methane Assessment for the UN Environment Programme (Unep).\nDrew Shindell, the study's lead author, and a professor of Earth science at Duke University in Durham, US, agrees CO2 is the number one target in the fight against climate change, but says cutting methane will have a more rapid impact.\n\"So many aspects of climate change are happening faster than expected\", he said. \"We see more fires, more of the strongest hurricanes, more heatwaves, and methane is the best lever we have to reduce the growth in those over the next 30 years.\"\nScientists regard a temperature rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as a gateway to \"dangerous\" warming of the planet. The Paris agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to keep the increase to within the 1.5C target.\nThe new report says measures available now could reduce emissions from human activities by as much as 180 million tonnes a year by 2030 - 45% of the total per year.\nThe main sources of human-related methane are the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for 34% of total emissions, agriculture which contributes another 40% and the waste sector 20%.\nOne of the difficulties in tackling the methane problem has been knowing precisely where the gas is coming from. But this is changing thanks to an emerging satellite capability that can pinpoint sources. The Canadian company GHGSat has the highest-resolution instrument in orbit currently, able to detect plumes of CH4 down to about 25m across. \nIn the example above, the technology is tracking emissions from a giant landfill area serving the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The area is outputting 16 tonnes of CH4 every hour, equivalent to nearly 400 tonnes/hr of CO2. \nOn an annualised basis, this is like the greenhouse gas output of 750,000 cars driving for a year. GHGSat's spacecraft are being followed by a fleet of other methane-detecting satellites this decade. Identifying super-emitters is about to get a lot easier.\nThe Unep report says the fossil fuel industry has the greatest potential for low-cost methane cuts.\nPlugging leaks in oil and gas wells and along production and transmission lines would significantly cut methane emissions at little to no cost, it concludes.\nMany of the reductions could quickly pay for themselves because reducing leaks means more gas available for sale.\nBut the report warns the continued expansion of the use of natural gas is not compatible with keeping warming to 1.5C without what it calls \"massive-scale deployment of unproven carbon removal technologies\".\nThe waste sector could cut its methane emissions by improving the disposal of sewage around the world.\nImproving the management of rice paddies has the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture but the report says the biggest generators of agricultural methane - livestock - are harder to abate.\nThere is little scope for technical solutions, it concludes, so the effort needs to be focused on reducing food waste and loss, improving livestock management and encouraging consumers to adopt what the report calls \"healthier diets\" - those with a lower meat and dairy content.\nIf a concerted effort managed to achieve that 45% cut in methane emissions, it would help avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming as early as the 2040s, the report claims.\nBecause of methane's contribution to the formation of ozone, up to a quarter of a million premature deaths could be avoided worldwide under the most aggressive emission abatement efforts.\nThis attempt to focus on the issue of methane is very welcome, said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, provided it does not distract from the need to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero as soon as possible.\nProf Euan Nisbet, from the greenhouse gas group at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: \"The actions it suggests, like cutting gas leaks and landfill emissions, are sensible, cost-effective and economically realistic. If fully implemented, these relatively inexpensive measures will help avoid nearly 0.3C of warming by mid-century.\"\nFollow Justin on Twitter."

However, until recently Johannah was still too young.\nDrisya and Dilin did not risk trying to fly back to India to be with Johannah because of the limited flights to return to Australia from there.\nThe coupled feared they would join the 9,000 people in India struggling to get home to Australia.\nDrisya and Dilin were finally able to get Johannah a seat on a chartered plane from Bangalore to Sydney, with a private company willing to take unaccompanied children. \nIt was due to arrive in Sydney on 6 May but  that flight was also cancelled when the Australian government brought in a controversial ban on all arrivals from India.\n\"It was our last hope, we have exhausted all options,\" Dilin told the BBC. \"We literally fell apart. Sometimes you get a ray of hope, but then there's a set back like this,\" he said.\nDrisya and Dilin told their story to an Australian Senate committee which is investigating the government's efforts to help stranded Australians return home from India.\nDrisya told the hearing that there were seven other unaccompanied children on the privately chartered flight. The couple, who have connected with families in similar situations on social media, say many of the children are very young - some even younger than Johannah.\n\"I plead, on behalf of all of them, to please consider the option of bringing in minors unaccompanied, either through repatriation flights or even private chartered flights,\" Dilin said.\nSenior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) official Lynette Wood said a flight specifically for children had not been considered, and that the government was working directly with families to try and bring children home. The BBC also approached the DFAT for comment on this article.\nAustralia's High Commissioner to India Barry O'Farrell told the hearing 20 unaccompanied minors had been helped home since December.\nThe trio were living in Malaysia and visiting family in India when Drisya and Dilin left Johannah to spend a longer holiday with her grandparents in the southern state of Kerala. They went back to Malaysia and started making preparations to move to Sydney a few months later.\nTheir reunion was thrown into disarray when the pandemic hit and Johannah's flight home was cancelled.\nAs time went on, all of the flights they managed to book were cancelled, or Johannah was \"bumped\" - which means she was no longer able to fly, because the number of people allowed to enter Australia that day had been reached. \nJohannah's Malaysian visa eventually expired, and her parents had to move to Sydney without her.\n\"When we can see her again she will have grown up a lot, it's that time we have lost, that we can never get back,\" Dilin told the Senate committee.\n\"What we have missed as parents is her prime childhood age\u2026 It's been almost one and a half years that we have not seen her grow,\" he added, holding back tears.\nDrisya often finds it hard to sleep and says she cries through the night, missing her young daughter.\n\"I can only imagine the emotional pain she is going through now, even though we are trying to keep her happy, buying her books, but I think from the bottom of her heart, there's nothing her parents can be replaced with,\" Dilin said."

      "text": "Pregnant women are struggling to get the coronavirus vaccine because clinics are unable to guarantee they will have the right type of jab available, Labour MP Stella Creasy has said. \nThe Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna jabs are preferable for pregnant women because there is more safety data available.\nBut the online booking system in England does not allow them to specify which vaccine they require. \nPregnant women are advised to speak to their GP instead of booking online.\nBut Ms Creasy, 44, said GPs do not always know when local vaccination centres will have specific types of the jab available. \nThe MP for Walthamstow, who is currently pregnant with her second child, said she had received five invitations to be vaccinated but she could not take them up because there is no system to specify she needs the Pfizer or Moderna jab. \n\"I don't think it's been made enough of a priority because there's a presumption it will become more of a priority as they move through the age groups, which is a misreading of the data about pregnancy,\" she told the BBC. \n\"More women in this country are pregnant over the age of 40 than under 20 so there are quite a lot of us now who qualify. \n\"There are also pregnant women who have serious health conditions who still can't get a vaccine because of a logistics problem.\"\nMs Creasy is currently working with doctors in Walthamstow, north-east London, to arrange for pregnant women to receive leftover Pfizer vaccines. \nBut she said there should be a national system in place to allow people to specify if they need a particular type of vaccine when booking an appointment.  \nGiuditta Fontana, 36, from Birmingham, has received a text inviting her to book her coronavirus vaccine but has been unable to do so yet. \nShe was told by her GP surgery that they were unable to book her in for a specific vaccine and was advised to call the 119 central booking service.\nBut she still encountered the same problem and was then told to visit her nearest vaccination centre to see what doses they had available. \nGiuditta tried a mass vaccination centre nearby but was told they did not have Moderna or Pfizer vaccines available. \nShe said many of her friends who are pregnant have had similar experiences - and even if they have booked an appointment they do not know which vaccine they will be offered. \nAt 32 weeks pregnant Giuditta is now worried she will not be able to be vaccinated before she gives birth and is concerned about the risk of catching Covid-19 in hospital. \n\"In my case, I know that in six weeks' time, I'm going to be taken into hospital, and I'm going to have a booked C-section. And I'm going to have to spend two or three days there,\" she said. \n\"It would really make a huge difference if I was able to have at least the first dose of the vaccine before getting into hospital.\"\n\"The whole process is proving incredibly stressful, which is something that in theory, you shouldn't experience in pregnancy,\" she added. \nOn 16 April, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, said pregnant women should get the coronavirus vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population, based on their age and any underlying health conditions. \nThere is no evidence to suggest other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women but more research is needed. \nReal-world data from the US shows around 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated, mainly with mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer and Modern jabs, without any safety concerns being raised. \nBased on this data, the JCVI says it is preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines where available.\nThey are also encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccines with their doctor before making the appointment.\nAn NHS England spokesman said: \"Following the updated guidance set out by the JCVI, the NHS immediately communicated the advice to GPs. \n\"If you're pregnant, or think you might be, speak to your maternity team or GP surgery to discuss your vaccine appointment so that it can be arranged at a site offering the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, which is preferable for pregnant women.\"\nAlthough pregnant women are at no greater risk of being infected by the virus, they are more likely to have complications from Covid-19.\nData shows that one in five pregnant women who become unwell with Covid needs to have her baby delivered early."

She suffered from a condition known as sarcoidosis, which affected her throat and lungs, and had made it difficult for her to breathe. \nOn 21 March 2020, she was on duty on the station concourse with her friend and colleague Motolani Sunmola, when they were involved in an incident with a customer. \nMs Sunmola, 52, told the BBC Panorama programme they were approached by a man who coughed on them and said: \"You know I have the virus.\" \nBritish Transport Police investigated but concluded there was not enough evidence to charge anyone with a crime.\nMr Walker said there was reason to suspect the death was \"unnatural\" and may have involved \"human error\". \nHe said the incident took place at a time when there was a \"recognised increased risk for frontline workers over PPE\" and therefore concerns about its provision by her employer, Govia Thameslink Railway.\nMs Mujinga's union, the Transport Salaried Staff Association (TSSA), described the decision as \"a step forward in the fight for justice\".\n\"Belly's death touched the nation and was keenly felt by so many transport workers who have bravely been on the front line throughout this terrible pandemic, it said.\n\"We simply must know what happened and the lessons which can be learned.\n\"For all these reasons, and to bring peace to Belly's family, without doubt it's in the public interest to have an inquest.\"\nThe British Transport Police, Govia Thameslink Railway and the Department for Transport were also in attendance at Friday's hearing.\nMr Walker will issue a date for the inquest in due course."

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Germany has voiced opposition to a US-backed proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines, saying they were not hindering production of the jabs.\nIts government said \"the protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so\".\nThe European Union earlier said it was ready to talk about the proposal, and some states gave it their full backing.\nSupporters of the plan say it will allow more manufactures to produce the life-saving vaccines. \nThey argue that this will increase access to jabs in poorer countries.\nBut opponents, including drug makers, say it may not have the desired effect.\nThe idea was originally proposed by India and South Africa, who have been leading a group of about 60 countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) - an intergovernmental body that promotes global commerce. The group is pushing for the temporary removal of intellectual property protections on vaccines.\nThe proposal was met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, as well as the UK and the EU. \nBut it gained momentum this week after the US backed it.\nWTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC's Newshour programme that she welcomed US support for the waiver. She said members should negotiate a pragmatic agreement over vaccine production because the current inequity was \"not right\".\nMs Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged the shortage of raw materials and technical expertise required on the ground, but said they would need to start somewhere to boost global supplies. \nMeanwhile in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country would allow the AstraZeneca vaccine to be administered to all adults, reversing a previous decision to restrict the shot to people over the age of 60 because of concerns over rare blood clots seen in a tiny number of recipients.\u00a0\nIn a statement on Thursday, the German government said the US-backed proposal would have \"significant implications for vaccine production as a whole\".\n\"The limiting factors in the production of vaccines are the production capacities and the high quality standards and not patents,\" it said, adding that pharmaceutical companies were already working with partners to ramp up manufacturing.\nGermany is the EU's biggest economic power and home to a major pharmaceutical sector, including BioNTech which developed one of the most widely-used coronavirus vaccines.\nThe remarks by the German government came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was \"ready to discuss\" the proposal on waiving patents. \nMs von der Leyen has previously spoken about her opposition to lifting intellectual property rights, telling the New York Times just weeks ago that she was \"not at all a friend of releasing patents\".\nMeanwhile, officials in other member states such as France and Italy gave the proposal their full backing.\nThe issue is reportedly set to be on the agenda at a two-day EU meeting this week.\nOutside of the EU, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a waiver.\nThe UK government said it was \"working with WTO members to resolve this issue\" and was \"in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines\". \nIntellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded.\nPatents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment.\nBiotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times.\nMany developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic.\nCalls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages.\nBut opponents, particularly from the industry, have said it will not solve the problem. \nThe head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme he was \"deeply concerned\" that \"you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now\".\n\"It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries,\" he said. \nSome experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect.\nNobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations shortsighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge. It is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production\nInstead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby knowhow is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. \nSome trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge.

The parts that don't burn up completely will remain and fall to Earth. \nIf all this happens uncontrolled, the place where the rocket burns up and where the debris will fall can be neither controlled nor accurately predicted. \nA previous launch of another Long March 5B in 2020 also saw the body re-enter in an uncontrolled way, with some debris crashing in a rural part of Ivory Coast.\nChina's space agency has not made any comment on whether the rocket is being controlled, or if it will make an uncontrolled descent, say reports. \nAstronomer Jonathan McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the issue of a uncontrolled re-entry is one that is \"only a big problem with the Long March 5B\". \n\"Small US and European upper stages also re-enter uncontrolled (and burn up entirely) but the big US or European rockets are specially designed not to leave big stages in orbit; they are always safely disposed of on the first orbit of the flight,\" he told the BBC. \n\"China decided they would rather use a simpler design and hope that they get lucky with the stage re-entering uncontrolled but not hurting anyone.\"\nA controlled re-entry would have meant that the rocket can still be controlled by the launch team, for instance via the rocket engine or small thrusters. The debris would usually be steered towards a specific crash site in the middle of the ocean and away from people.\nThat way, the flight path can be influenced and re-entry can be immediate and at a predictable location. \nUsually, this would be in what is called the oceanic pole of inaccessibility - the furthest place from land in the South Pacific, between Australia, New Zealand and South America.\nOver an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) this region is a graveyard of spacecraft and satellites, where the remains of around 260 are thought to be scattered on the ocean floor.\nThe current Long March rocket took off on 29 April 2021 from China's Wenchang Space Launch Centre.\nIt was carrying the key module for a new permanent space station as part of China's increasingly ambitious space programme. \nBeijing plans to have at least 10 more similar launches, carrying all the additional equipment into orbit, before the completion of the station by 2022. \nChina also also plans to build a lunar station in cooperation with Russia. \nThe country has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration, sending its first astronaut into space only in 2003, decades after the Soviet Union and the US did so.  \nReporting by the BBC's Andreas Illmer"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Twelve destinations have been put on a green travel list for people in England, meaning anyone returning will not need to quarantine from 17 May.\nA new traffic light system of rules means international travel will no longer be illegal.\nHowever, places on the green list - which includes Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar - have their own restrictions on who can visit from abroad.\nThe transport secretary said the UK approach was \"necessarily cautious\".\nBut the travel industry has said it is too cautious and called it a reopening of air travel \"in name only\". \nTurkey, the Maldives and Nepal will be added to England's red list of countries from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, meaning travellers from those destinations will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return.\nThe biggest group is the amber list - which includes popular European destinations such as Spain, Italy and France.\nPeople returning from those countries have to isolate from home for at least five days - but Mr Shapps said no-one should be travelling to those destinations at the moment. \nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel restrictions, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said all four of the UK's chief medical officers agreed on the principles behind the traffic light system.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Shapps said the changes were a \"tentative\" first step to opening up travel, as there remained \"concern about the resurgence of Covid\".\nMr Shapps said the \"success in combating Covid\" in the UK was \"not yet replicated in many places abroad\".\n\"We must make sure the countries we reconnect with are safe,\" he added.\nCovid tests will be required before and after travel.\nThe long-awaited restart of international travel is less throwing open the doors, more opening them a crack.\nThat's a deliberate decision by the government, which is hoping to reassure those who are nervous about opening the country's borders while also giving a small concession to the travel industry.\nSome in the industry are not impressed, calling the list a \"missed opportunity\". \nMany of the transport secretary's comments - he dissuaded passengers from travelling to amber countries and warned them to expect queues at the border - will be seen as trying to dampen down demand, just at the moment when the industry was hoping to start to ramp up.\nUltimately, the real test will be in a few weeks' time when the government will announce the green list for June. The industry will be hoping it's a little longer than this list.\nMr Shapps said people looking to travel overseas should check any restrictions that apply to new arrivals, and not book trips which do not include a refund should the Covid situation change.\nCountries on the green, amber and red lists would be reviewed every three weeks from 17 May, he added.\nSpain's ministry of tourism said the decision had no immediate effect with restrictions still in place for non-essential travel from the UK. \nBut a spokesperson said Madrid \"reiterates its conviction that this summer it will be possible for British citizens to spend their holidays in Spain\" and it predicts that in June \"we will be able to start the reactivation of international travel\". \nThe travel industry has been largely critical, with Airlines UK calling the move a missed opportunity and \"a reopening of air travel in name only\" which leaves the UK \"at risk of falling behind\". \nAndrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm Tui, said it was \"an overly cautious start\".   \nEasyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: \"The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy.\"\nTravellers have also been warned of queues at the UK border when they return. \nBorder Force director Paul Lincoln said the increased delays would be at each stage of their journeys, with staff required to check \"100%\" of all travellers coming through.\nRed list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals and UK residents allowed to return. They must pay for a 10-day stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel.\nAsked what Turkey being added to the red list means for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea in Istanbul, Mr Shapps said fans should not travel to Turkey.\nHe added that the Football Association is in discussions with European football's governing body UEFA about the UK hosting the final.\nThe full list of 12 countries and territories people in England can travel to without having to quarantine upon return are:\nAre you planning to travel abroad?

      "text": "Increasing numbers of top female athletes will walk away from their sport due to difficulties during the pandemic, leading figures have warned.\nGymnast Latalia Bevan, 20, and rugby international Angharad de Smet, 24, say Covid has left their careers in the balance.    \nSports sociologist Dr Ali Bowes said it had highlighted inequalities in sport. \n\"There are absolutely concerns women will walk away,\" she said. \nWales rugby international de Smet, who has worked on the front line during the pandemic, said she's been left wondering whether \"the love of the game is enough?\" \nThe 24-year-old from Ammanford, who was playing for Wales in the Autumn Internationals and as part of the sevens squad before Covid-19, was \"living the life of a professional athlete, without the pay cheque\". \nBut as Wales began its first lockdown, games and training were cancelled.  \nOver the last year, she said she's trained with just one kettlebell, unable to access proper equipment or facilities. Her last game of rugby was 14 months ago.\nThe physiotherapist technician, who works on an elderly care ward in Swansea, said she has struggled to train after gruelling shifts in hospital. \n\"You've seen things you would hope to never see again in your lifetime, to come home and try and do a gym session... in your tiny kitchen... you think 'why am I bothering?'\" \nIn 2019, the 24-year-old had been travelling to Worcester to train a couple of times a week after work, arriving home in the early hours.  \n\"Nobody understands how much we give, just the wear and tear on your car, the petrol, putting food on the table, trying to get good food into you to aid recovery is expensive.\" \nNow, she describes her future in the sport as \"uncertain\".  \n\"Do I put my career first or do I pursue my dream of playing internationally, becoming a professional athlete? I am 24, should I have to make those sorts of calls already?\" \nCommonwealth Games silver medallist Latalia Bevan said the challenges of a global pandemic were a \"massive\" factor in her decision to retire from elite gymnastics earlier this year. \n\"It was so hard to keep your motivation, we'd do two or three Zooms a day, so my home turned into a gym and I'm from a family of seven.\" \nThe 20-year-old from Merthyr Tydfil, who won Wales' first gymnastics medal at the Gold Coast 2018 Games in Australia, had been training for 32 hours a week as well as studying at university in Cardiff. \nAs a student, she used her loan to help cover costs after losing GB funding and while recovering from an operation. \nBut after leaving her studies, she lost the financial support and struggled to adjust to a new life away from the gym after 14 years. \nShe's been working as a home carer since retiring and said it's nice not to have to rely on her family to pay for things. \nThe former gymnast said she'd thought about returning to the sport but, if she did, she'd have to quit her job and that isn't an option with rent to pay. \nShe's now focused on becoming a gymnastics coach and personal trainer. \nRugby player Alecs Donovan \"would never have thought\" that at the end of the third lockdown she'd retire.\nWith her yoga businesses closed, the 30-year-old said she was able to train \"more than ever\".  \nThe business owner said the pandemic has given her the chance to sit back and prioritise seeing family and friends.  \nAs a personal trainer who works with professional male athletes, she said it can be worse seeing their schedules and the support they get. \nShe added she was aware of women who don't go for promotions because their current job allows them to play the sport, but she wonders what will happen when rugby stops.\nDr Ali Bowes, senior lecturer in sociology of sport at Nottingham Trent University, said: \"It's one year on from lockdown and it's really obvious where the inequalities exist.\"\nHer research, looking at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on elite women's sport, found women struggled to access equipment, a gender \"play\" gap where men's sport returned faster and financial difficulties for women who were unable to play. \n\"There are absolutely concerns that women will walk away and we've seen that already with some examples in a number of sports where it's been too difficult for them to continue,\" she said.\nThe sociologist is optimistic that discussions about the problems in women's sport, and the difficulties athletes face can be used for positive change.  \n\"There's also been significant forward steps, and it's put equality really on the agenda for lots of sports organisations, teams, clubs and national governing bodies. There's no hiding place now.\""

      "tags": "Scottish Parliament election 2021,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. \nThe party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives.\nIt also won the East Lothian seat from Labour.\nBut it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday.\nNo other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one.\nBut the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday.\nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament.\nAnd he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. \nThe Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.\nClick or tap to explore results\nAs the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. \nFriday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. \nMs Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016.\nTurnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. \nMs Sturgeon said that the SNP \"appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again\".\nShe pledged to \"get back to work immediately\" and lead the country's Covid recovery.\n\"And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,\" she added.\nIt comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be \"irresponsible and reckless\" right now.\nAsked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he told the Daily Telegraph: \"I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. \n\"I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want.\"\nHowever deputy first minister John Swinney told BBC Breakfast that his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one.\nHe said: \"We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament.\"\nMr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the \"electoral arithmetic\" of the final results, he was \"very confident\" there would be a majority of candidates \"elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence\".\nThis election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. \nWhile the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. \nTo achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. \nThere is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. \nIf the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. \nTogether the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. \nA big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. \nThe constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats.\nThe Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP.\nAnd Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. \nThe election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence.\nThe SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2.\nAlthough it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant that traditional overnight counting was impossible, with the results instead being announced over the course of Friday and Saturday.\nA record number of people had already cast their ballots by post before the polls opened on Thursday morning - with more than a million having registered  for postal ballots.\nOther elections also took place across the UK on Thursday, including for the Welsh Parliament, 143 English councils and 13 local mayors, as well as a by-election for the Westminster seat of Hartlepool in the north east of England - which was won by the Conservatives from Labour.\nSIGN UP FOR SCOTLAND ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage"

      "text": "Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament.\nThe Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats.\nLabour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru.\nLeader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a \"stable and progressive\" government.\nWith 52 of the 60 seats declared, Labour is on 30 with the Conservatives on 12, Plaid Cymru nine and the Liberal Democrats one.\nIt is unlikely Labour will gain further seats when votes for the regional lists in South Wales Central and South Wales East are counted on Saturday, after the party won the lion's share of constituency seats there.\nCurrent first minister Mr Drakeford, who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would \"do whatever I can\" to ensure Wales has a \"stable and progressive\" government.\nHe added he would prefer to be in a position \"where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd\".\nHe added: \"Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales.\"\nLabour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood.\nHer win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000.\nBen Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a \"terrible blow for the party\".\nAsked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a \"dead duck\".\n\"The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nPlaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr.\nWith three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one.\nThe Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire.\nThe party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay.\nBut the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.  \nThe Labour seats of Alyn and Deeside, Gower, Swansea East, Swansea West, Neath, Aberavon, Ogmore, Bridgend, Cynon Valley, Pontypridd, Cardiff Central, Cardiff North, Cardiff South and Penarth, Cardiff West, Caerphilly, Islwyn, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Newport West and Torfaen have also remained red.\nLabour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected.\nFollowing his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was \"definitely an asset\", due to his leadership during the pandemic.\n\"He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,\" he said.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: \"The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted.\"\nDespite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%.\nThis beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections.\nLaura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had \"performed better than most people expected\".\n\"After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement.\"\nPolitical commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: \"I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK.\n\"The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected.\n\"For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election.\"\nThe Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's \"red wall\" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election.\nWinning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: \"It's a magnificent achievement. \n\"In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled.\"\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was \"fantastic\".\nNorth Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders saying she had been \"horrified\" by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign.\nLabour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales.\nIt's the last brick in the wall.\nBut they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount.\nSo it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives.\nLabour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber.\nOf the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East.\nA party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats.\nIt previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011.\nFor Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. \nShe said the pandemic had meant \"ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year\".\nIt had been an \"extraordinarily different\" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, \"to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform\". \n\"At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,\" she added.\nAdam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader.\nDespite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a \"net positive\".\n\"I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,\" he said.\n\"This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us.\n\"We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own.\n\"I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.\"\nMeanwhile, the Welsh Liberal Democrats lost their constituency seat in Brecon and Radnorshire but won a list seat in Mid and West Wales with party leader Jane Dodds heading for the Senedd.\nLiberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections.\n\"I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,\" said Baroness Randerson.\nIan Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. \n\"This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,\" he said.\n\"That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces.\"\nThe Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists.\nVoting also took place for four police and crime commissioners, with those votes to be counted on Sunday.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage"

Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

Two men have been taken to hospital suffering [from the effects of] smoke inhalation.\"\nKaren and John Archibald, who live with their daughter in an adjacent block, said they had been expecting scaffolders to arrive to remove cladding this week.\nResidents in Block D said they were alerted by a security guard shouting at them to get out.\nMatthew Robb saw thick smoke coming from the middle section as he left and said one woman was in tears having escaped from the building. \nHe said there has been frustration at delays in having the tower block's cladding replaced. \nThe development, owned by Irish company Ballymore, has 1,535 apartments across a number of buildings and houses a Radisson Blu hotel. \nWork to replace cladding is \"under way\" and the main contractor had been due to take possession of the site on Monday, according to Ballymore. \nAn email sent to residents by the company, which has been seen by the BBC, said everyone had been evacuated and there were no life-threatening injuries.\nKenneth Law, who lives in nearby Charrington Tower, described watching the blaze take hold.\nHe told the BBC: \"I saw lots of black smoke coming from one of the apartments and then I saw flames and it quickly spread to the apartments above and debris started to fall out.\n\"Firefighters came quickly and then eventually managed to put out the fire.\n\"But it was really scary. I am on a resident WhatsApp group for the area and some people weren't even aware what was going on.\n\"Someone mentioned there was no fire alarm either, and many didn't know what was going on.\n\"Many residents have now been evacuated and there's a hotel next door so I believe they've been moved into there.\"\nMayor of Tower Hamlets John Biggs expressed his concern about the fire and said he was speaking to council officers and LFB.\nHe said: \"I've been working with residents of this block for a long time to help them resolve fire safety issues. Their safety must come first.\"\nA London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said they were called out at 09:05, and sent ambulance crews, clinical team managers, an emergency planning and resilience officer and hazardous area response teams."

      "text": "Prices for international travel are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned.\nBooking.com's chief executive Glenn Fogel told the BBC that holiday \"prices are already going up\". \nMany airlines have significantly reduced the number of flights they operate due to travel restrictions.\nHowever, Tui's UK boss Andrew Flintham said it would be \"a long time\" before holiday firms try to boost profits.\nMr Fogel said that despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service.\n\"There's so much pent-up demand,\" said Mr Fogel. \"Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely.\"\nJohn Grant, an aviation analyst with global travel data provider OAG said this will have a knock-on impact on air fares as travel restrictions are eased. \n\"That will, in the short term, create a rush of pent-up demand and revenge spending,\" he said.\n\"In turn, the airline algorithms will detect an uptick in demand and move prices up accordingly\".\nThe government will shortly announce which foreign destinations holidaymakers from England can visit from 17 May without needing to quarantine on their return.\nAir fares to Portugal - which is expected to be on the green list - have already started to rise as airlines respond to higher demand.\nAccording to PA, British Airways is charging \u00a3530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on 17 May, compared with \u00a3276 two days earlier.\nA Ryanair flight from Stansted to Lisbon costs \u00a3262 on 19 May, PA found, more than double the price of \u00a3128 on 14 May.\nBut Tui's managing director for the UK and Ireland, Andrew Flintham, told BBC Breakfast travel firms were unlikely to push up prices anytime soon.\n\"Our prices are very, very stable. They're pretty much like for like, flat, year over year. There isn't a big increase in there.\n\"We've got plenty of holidays to sell. I think everybody in the industry has.\n\"It'll be a long time before the idea of trying to increase prices to make more money. We want to get people away on holiday, having a great time, because we think they genuinely all deserve it.\"\nA lack of clarity about how governments will go about recognising vaccine and testing statuses from other countries is troubling the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Fogel believes a single system would be helpful: \"So many different people in so many different governments are talking about different programmes, but right now, there is nothing out there that is unified, so it's very confusing. \n\"I listened to the prime minister of Italy saying how they want to let people into Italy soon and you just have to prove that you have a vaccine and it'd be great. \n\"And my thinking is, well, I have my vaccine myself, but how do I prove it? Do I just bring my little white card that I got in the US that said I got it, is that going to be good enough? We need some clarifications.\"\nSeveral systems are being explored, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA)'s travel pass, which is being trialled by a number of airlines.\nMeanwhile, the European Union is working on having a digital pass ready in time for the summer holidays.\nThe idea of a scheme that allows passengers who have had the vaccine to travel has proved divisive.  \nThe UK equality watchdog recently warned it could create a \"two-tier society, whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights\". \nThat's a view supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) but Mr Fogel disagrees.\n\"It's true that if you're not vaccinated, you may not be able to enter a country under this type of a system,\" he said.\n\"But I'm okay with that. Because the alternative is what - nobody gets to go in? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\" \nHe added that there are countries that people cannot go into if they don't have proof of vaccination against yellow fever, for example. \n\"There's nothing wrong with using technology to prove you are a safe traveller that can help get the industry up faster,\" said Mr Fogel.\nThe lack of clarity has hurt the finances of Booking.com's US owner Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak and rentalcars.com. \nRevenues for the three months to the end of March fell to $1.1bn (\u00a3790m) - 50% lower than the same period a year ago.\nFigures from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) reflect a similar picture across the industry, showing tourism's value to the global economy fell from nearly $9.2tn in 2019 to $4.7tn in 2020.  \nAs a share of the global economy that equates to a fall from 10.4% to just 5.5%.\nBut Mr Fogel, who is chief executive of both the Dutch-based Booking.com and its parent firm Booking Holdings, told investors that there is still reason to be optimistic things will improve.\n\"While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs,\" he said.\n\"In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is key to unlocking pent-up travel demand.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,China,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted emergency approval for a Covid vaccine made by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm.\nIt is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get WHO backing. \nThe vaccine has already been given to millions of people in China and elsewhere. \nThe WHO had previously only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna.\nBut individual health regulators in various countries - especially poorer ones in Africa, Latin America and Asia - have approved Chinese jabs for emergency use.\nWith little data released internationally early on, the effectiveness of the various Chinese vaccines has long been uncertain.\nBut the WHO on Friday said it had validated the \"safety, efficacy and quality\" of the Sinopharm jab developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products.\nThe WHO said the addition of the vaccine had \"the potential to rapidly accelerate Covid-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk\".\nIt is recommending that the vaccine be administered in two doses to those aged 18 and over.\nA decision is expected in the coming days on another Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac, while Russia's Sputnik vaccine is under assessment. \nThe green light from the global health body is a guideline for national regulators that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it would give countries \"confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval\".\nIt also means that the vaccine can be used in the global Covax programme, which was set up last year to try to ensure fair access to vaccines among rich and poor nations.\nThe decision to list the Chinese vaccine for emergency use is expected to give a substantial boost to the scheme, which has been struggling with supply problems.\nPrior to the WHO approval, the Sinopharm vaccine was already being widely used, with an estimated 65 million doses administered, according to reports. \nIn addition to China, countries already using the vaccine include the UAE, Pakistan and Hungary. \nThe decision on Friday to approve the vaccine for emergency use was made by the WHO's technical advisory group, which reviewed the latest clinical data and manufacturing practices. \nIt said the vaccine's efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised cases of Covid-19 was estimated to be 79%.\nThe WHO noted that few adults over the age of 60 were included in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated for this age group. But it said there was no reason to think that the vaccine would act differently in older recipients.\nThe health body is yet to reach a decision on China's Sinovac vaccine. WHO experts on Friday said they were awaiting additional information before they could make a recommendation. \nMillions of doses of that vaccine have also already been shipped to a number of countries, which have permitted its emergency usage. \nOne of the Chinese vaccines' main advantages is that they can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe WHO said these \"easy storage requirements\" made the Sinopharm vaccine \"highly suitable for low-resource settings\".\nThe two Chinese vaccines differ significantly from some of the other Covid vaccines currently in use, especially those by Pfizer and Moderna.\nDeveloped in a more traditional way, they are so-called inactivated vaccines, which means they use killed viral particles to expose the immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response.\nBy comparison, the BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, training the immune system how to respond to it.\nThe UK's AstraZeneca vaccine is yet another type of vaccine where a version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees is modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus. Once injected, it teaches the immune system how to fight the real virus.\nBioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna have an efficacy rate of around 90% or higher, while the AstraZeneca jab is thought to be around 76%.\nIn April, China's top disease control official said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines was low, although he later insisted his comments had been misinterpreted.

Mass immigration, Marxism?\n\"I'm not a fascist. I've been on the ground speaking to locals who say you are an absolute disgrace ...\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"We'll see what the locals' view is later on.\"\nMs Fransen said: \"The locals, what the ones you have flooded from other countries?\n\"The decent people of Scotland don't want it flooded with immigrants.\"\nMs Sturgeon then told her: \"You are a fascist, you are a racist and the southside of Glasgow will reject you.\"\nThe first minister then walked away with party members as Ms Fransen pursued her, talking about \"mass immigration\" and \"Marxism\".\nMs Fransen later told an SNP supporter who asked her who she was: \"I'm not fascist, just a normal, decent unionist patriot. My grandfather fought the Nazis.\"\nIn a piece to camera uploaded afterwards by the British Freedom Party, she accused Ms Sturgeon of \"running away like a coward\", adding: \"Of course if you flood a constituency with foreigners and hardline republicans who absolutely hate Britain, hate the Union, they are going to secure their votes.\n\"The unionist community are no longer unrepresented and we are coming for you.\"\nMs Fransen has previously been pictured outside the constituency office of Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf holding a sign saying \"it's okay to be white\" and has said she is running against the \"SNP commie, Marxists, naughty people\".\nShe has previously been convicted of a number of religiously aggravated crimes, including harassment in both 2016 and 2018 - the latter of which saw her sentenced to 36 weeks in prison.\nAlthough a member of the British Freedom Party, documents from Glasgow City Council show Ms Fransen is running as an independent. \nThe video was shared by Nicola Sturgeon, who said: \"Glasgow Southside is the most diverse and multi-cultural constituency in Scotland - one of the many things that makes it so brilliant.

      "text": "A World War Two pilot who was part of the Great Escape team is to have a train named after him.\nWing Cdr Ken Rees was imprisoned in Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp, now part of Poland, and helped dig a tunnel that prisoners fled through in March 1944.\nHe was caught in the shaft during the breakout when it was found by a guard.\nHe was said to have inspired Steve McQueen's character in the film based on their story, though he denied this.\nAt Friday's naming ceremony at Swansea railway station will be air officer for Wales, Air Cdre Dai Williams, the RAF Queen's Colour Squadron, and under-secretary of state for Wales, David TC Davies.\nGreat Western Railway set out to mark last year's 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two by naming seven trains after people involved in the conflict.\nMr Rees's name will feature on Intercity 800310, which will form the 11:22 BST service from Swansea to London Paddington after the ceremony.\nThe Wrexham-born bomber command pilot was shot down over Norway in October 1942, just two weeks after getting married.\nHe was taken to Stalag Luft III, a prisoner of war camp for airmen that was a template for the camp in 1963's The Great Escape.\nMr Rees was a digger on a tunnel named Harry, the longest of a number of tunnels, and the one used to make their getaway.\nIn the film, McQueen's character Capt Virgil Hilts is supposed to have been based on Mr Rees due to the fact Mr Rees antagonised his captors after his brother-in-law, Sqn Ldr Harold Starr, was shot under his parachute in the Battle of Britain.\nHis dissent usually amounted to pulling faces or letting down bicycles tyres, which meant being marched off.\nMr Rees always insisted he had nothing to do with the claim McQueen's character was based on him.\nBefore he died in 2014 at the age of 93, he said: \"He is taller than I am, I'm heavier than he is, he's American and I'm a Welshman. \n\"The only things we've got in common is that we both annoyed the Germans and ended up doing stretches in the cooler.\n\"I didn't get out and if I did, I wouldn't have been able to ride a motorbike anyway.\"\nAir Cdre Williams welcomed the chance to commemorate Mr Rees: \"It will be a privilege to acknowledge the service of this remarkable RAF Officer.\"\nGWR engineering director, Simon Green, added: \"It is right that we honour some of those heroes of the war effort, remembering the sacrifice, bravery and tenacity that later generations owe so much to.\""

      "text": "The vaccination of younger adults in Moray is to be accelerated because of the coronavirus surge in the area.\nNHS Grampian has announced appointments will start being given from Saturday to those between 18 and 39 who have not already been vaccinated.\nHealth officials are urging everyone in Moray to take up asymptomatic testing in a bid to combat the recent spread.\nThey are also considering the introduction of door-to-door testing in Elgin. \nMoray is experiencing what is being described as \"uncontrolled, sustained community transmission\" of Covid-19.\nThe region currently has an infection rate of more than 81 cases per 100,000 - four times the Scotland-wide level.\nKatrina Morrison, the clinical lead nurse for the vaccination programme, said additional stocks and the sustained community transmission in Moray had made the decision \"straightforward\".\nShe said: \"It needs to happen quickly and our staff have been mobilised to speed up the process.\n\"During the first few days, we will phone to offer appointments before moving to letter appointments from the middle of next week. You may not recognise the number or the number may be withheld.

      "tags": "Brazil,Rio de Janeiro",
      "text": "The United Nations human rights office has strongly criticised a police raid against suspected drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro, amid allegations of abuse and extrajudicial executions.\nThe deadliest police operation in the city's history has left 28 dead, including a police officer.\nResidents say police killed people who wanted to surrender and entered homes without a warrant. \nPolice have denied any wrongdoing, saying officers acted in self-defence.\nRio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent cities, and vast areas are under the control of criminals, many of them linked to powerful drug-trafficking gangs. Security forces are often accused of disproportionate force during their anti-crime operations.\nThursday's raid in Jacarezinho, one of the city's largest slums known as favelas, was carried out by about 200 heavily armed police officers and included an armoured helicopter with a sniper. The area is dominated by Comando Vermelho, or Red Command, one of Brazil's largest criminal organisations.\nA television helicopter filmed men jumping from rooftops, while desperate residents posted videos on social media showing intense shootouts as they claimed police had invaded their houses and used excessive violence.\n\"There are boys who have been cornered in the house and want to surrender,\" one resident said, referring to the suspects. \"And the police want to kill them. They have even killed some in front of us.\"\nIn another video, a resident filmed a police officer standing next to a house and said: \"They're cornering [the suspects]. They don't want to let the boys surrender.\"\nMaria J\u00falia Miranda, a public defender, said residents told her a suspect was killed in the bedroom of an eight-year-old girl where there were blood stains on the floor and on her bed, and that the family had witnessed the alleged execution.\nMs Miranda said she was \"shocked\" by seeing \"lots of pools of blood... and walls with bullet marks\" when visiting the favela. There was also evidence that the scenes of the killings were not preserved, she said, with bodies being removed. \"On these cases,\" she added, \"there was probably an execution.\" \nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International, said they had also received reports and images from residents saying that their houses had been invaded, and that the police had killed people when they already offered no risk.\n\"It's completely unacceptable,\" Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, said in a statement. \"Even if the victims were suspected of criminal association, which has not been proven, summary executions of this kind are entirely unjustifiable.\" \nThe level of violence caused shock even in Rio, which for decades has been plagued by high levels of crime and police brutality. Between January and March, 404 people were killed in police operations in the city's metropolitan area, according to official figures.\nAlmost all raids happen in communities where residents are mostly black and poor, and some of the victims are not even suspects. Critics say the operations are often badly planned and frequently end in bloodshed while allegations of misconduct by officers are rarely investigated, with impunity virtually the norm.\n\"This kind of operation doesn't dismantle criminal groups, it only causes pain and distrust,\" Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a Rio-based think tank, said in a statement. \"The social impact of this case is still unknown but will certainly last for years.\"\nAmid widespread condemnation, the United Nations human rights office called for an independent investigation, describing it as a \"long-standing trend of unnecessary and disproportionate\" police operations.\n\"You have the institutions which control these operations... So, it appears that collectively, they are not succeeding in stopping these kinds of really disturbing, over-the-top, lethal operations. So something is clearly wrong there,\" spokesman Rupert Colville said in Geneva.\nThe officer killed was named as 48-year-old Inspector Andr\u00e9 Leonardo de Mello Frias, who was shot in the head while trying to remove a barricade set up by the criminals. Police have not yet identified the other people killed but said six suspects had been arrested.\nRodrigo Oliveira, a police chief, defended the police's actions, saying that officers acted within the law. \"The only execution that took place was that of the police officer,\" he said at a news conference where\u00a0police displayed an arsenal of weapons that had been seized, including six assault rifles and a submachine gun.\nPolice say they launched the operation to serve 21 arrest warrants as part of a year-long investigation that suggested gangs were recruiting children, among other crimes. Experts again questioned the force used given that minors are used by criminals across the city.\n\"This is cruel, barbaric,\" Joel Luiz Costa, a lawyer from Jacarezinho, said in a video posted on Twitter. \"Twenty-five people or more were killed. Did it end drug trafficking? Will this end drug trafficking?\"\nThe raid happened despite a court ruling last June that restricted police action in poor areas of Rio during the pandemic unless it was deemed essential. The Rio state public prosecutor's office said it would launch an investigation while the police said they would also open an inquiry.\nThere has been no comment from far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. A former army captain, he supports changes in legislation that would protect officers from prosecution if they kill suspects, and has previously said that \"a good criminal is a dead criminal\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nFrom 17 May, people resident in England will be able to resume travel and go to 12 countries and territories without quarantining on their return. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced at a Downing Street briefing the \"green list\" of destinations will include Portugal, Israel, Gibraltar, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, as well as more remote islands. Mr Shapps said the list was \"necessarily cautious\" to ensure \"countries we reconnect with are safe, that their infection rates are low and their vaccination rates are high\". However, some of the countries on the list are not currently allowing visitors from abroad. Mr Shapps also said travellers will be able to prove their vaccination status from 17 May using the NHS app or by requesting a paper document.\nA decision to offer under-30s in the UK an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine over a possible link to rare blood clots is being extended to most adults aged under 40. According to the medicines safety regulator, there have now been 28.5 million doses given out, with 242 cases of the rare clots and 49 deaths. But the risk is slightly higher for younger people - who are also less at risk of Covid - meaning the benefits and risks are \"more finely balanced\".  Meanwhile, figures show that two-thirds of over-18s in the UK have now had a first dose of a vaccine.\nThe father of a five-year-old girl trapped in India since the pandemic began has spoken of his anguish at losing his \"last hope\" of flying her back to Australia. Dilin, who asked to be identified only by his first name, told the BBC that his daughter Johannah had been too young to fly back on government repatriation flights after visiting her grandparents. Then a chartered flight on 6 May was cancelled as Australia banned all arrivals from India. \"We have exhausted all options. We literally fell apart,\" he said. At least 173 unaccompanied children are among those trying to return from India to Australia.\nAs one of the Covid-19 variants identified in India is designated a \"variant of concern\" in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government needs to think \"very carefully\" about the public health response. B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly than two other identified subtypes of the Indian variant. Scientists believe it is at least as transmissible as the variant first spotted in Kent last year. But Public Health England said there was not enough evidence to suggest it causes more severe illness or makes vaccines less effective. Surge testing is being rolled out in hotspots such as Bolton.\nA restored medieval shrine in St Albans Cathedral is to carry a memento of the Covid-19 pandemic which delayed its completion - a carved figure wearing a face mask. The shrine of St Amphibalus will open to visitors on 17 May, nearly a year after its restoration was due to be finished. It is one of only 13 medieval pedestal shrines remaining in Britain and preserves all of the surviving 14th Century carvings. In one of the empty spaces, the carvers included the masked figure to commemorate the pandemic. A cathedral spokesman said it \"reminds us the history of St Albans stretches forwards as well as backwards\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nNot quite ready to book a holiday abroad?

      "tags": "Television,Noel Clarke,BBC,Doctor Who,Sexual harassment",
      "text": "The BBC has said it is \"shocked\" to hear allegations by several women that actor Noel Clarke sexually harassed them on the set of Doctor Who.\nMr Clarke played Mickey Smith in the BBC drama from 2005 to 2010. \nThe Guardian has quoted five women, including an unnamed actress, who it says have claimed that he touched them inappropriately or made sexual remarks.\nHe denied all the claims. He has previously \"vehemently\" denied sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.\nThe latest reports come a week after 20 women told The Guardian that Mr Clarke, 45, had harassed or bullied them during his career as a TV and film actor, writer, director and producer.\nLast week, he said he understood that \"some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise\" and said he was \"deeply sorry\" to those people. But he denied that his actions constituted sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.\nHe told The Guardian that he strongly denied the latest allegations. His representatives have not responded to a BBC request for comment.\nA BBC spokesman said: \"The BBC is against all forms of inappropriate behaviour and we're shocked to hear of these allegations.\n\"To be absolutely clear, we will investigate any specific allegations made by individuals to the BBC - and if anyone has been subjected to or witnessed inappropriate behaviour of any kind we would encourage them to raise it with us directly.\n\"We have a zero tolerance approach and robust processes are in place - which are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect best practice - to ensure any complaints or concerns are handled with the utmost seriousness and care.\"\nLast week, Sky \"halted\" its work with Mr Clarke, including on the fourth series of crime drama Bulletproof, while ITV dropped the final episode of his drama Viewpoint from its broadcast schedules. The BBC said it would \"not be progressing any projects with Noel Clarke at this time\".\nBafta has suspended his membership, weeks after giving him an outstanding contribution award, and the Metropolitan Police have said they have received allegations of sexual offences from a third party.\nMeanwhile on Friday, Doctor Who and Torchwood actor John Barrowman was said by The Guardian to have repeatedly exposed himself on set. It said that was regarded as \"larking about\" and \"joking\" rather than sexually predatory behaviour.\nA video of Mr Clarke joking about Mr Barrowman's behaviour at a 2015 sci-fi convention resurfaced and went viral last week.\nIn 2008, Mr Barrowman apologised for exposing his genitals during a live BBC Radio 1 broadcast. At the time, he said he \"was joining in the light-hearted and fun banter of the show and went too far\".\nIn a new statement to The Guardian, he said his \"high-spirited behaviour\" was \"only ever intended in good humour to entertain colleagues on set and backstage\".\nHe added: \"With the benefit of hindsight, I understand that upset may have been caused by my exuberant behaviour and I have apologised for this previously. Since my apology in November 2008, my understanding and behaviour have also changed.\"\nMr Barrowman added that he was never made aware of any allegations against Mr Clarke.\nMr Barrowman has not responded to a BBC request for further comment."

      "tags": "State schools,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Poor pupils have fallen further behind in maths as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to research. \nThe Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) study suggests primary-school pupils eligible for free school meals have fallen another month behind their classmates since the first lockdown. \nAnd the gap is unlikely to narrow without intervention, despite all pupils returning to class in September.\nThe government has already made \u00a31.7bn catch-up funding available in England.\nBut Sir Peter Lampl, who chairs the EEF, is calling for significant extra funding to mitigate against the long-term impact of school closures as failing to act now will be a \"catastrophe\" for disadvantaged children.\nPupils from 132 primary schools in England were tested in autumn 2019, September 2020 and then towards the end of the autumn term. \nContrary to previous estimates, the interim findings of this study indicated no discernible change to the disadvantage gap in reading. \nPrevious studies have suggested children in England are up to three months behind in their studies after lockdown, with boys and poor pupils worst hit. \nResearch by the National Foundation for Educational indicated the learning gap between rich and poor pupils had grown by almost 50% between March and July 2020. \nThe EEF report found considerable variation in how schools and teachers responded to the huge disruptions caused by Covid-19. \nFor example, 23% of teachers surveyed reported phoning pupils at least once a week, while 37% never called them.\nAnd 24% of schools in the study provided video lessons, while the remaining 76% did not. \nBut the research found no clear evidence of a link between different teaching methods and changes to the achievements of pupils. \nEEF chief executive Prof Becky Francis said: \"The pandemic has brought the significance of social and educational inequality into sharp focus. \n\"Research studies like this one are providing clear evidence that substantial existing gaps have grown further due to the disruption to learning caused by the pandemic.\"\nA department for education spokesperson said: \"We have invested \u00a31.7 billion in ambitious catch-up activity, including high-quality tutoring and summer school provision. The majority of the funding is targeted towards those most in need, while giving schools the flexibility to use it as they believe best, to support their pupils.\n\"We are working with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to recover from the impact of the pandemic as quickly and comprehensively as possible.\" "

      "tags": "Hartlepool by-election 2021",
      "text": "The Conservatives have beaten Labour in the Hartlepool by-election, with a Tory MP elected for the first time in the current constituency's history.\nTory candidate Jill Mortimer - who defeated Labour rival Paul Williams by nearly 7,000 votes - hailed the result as a \"truly historic\" moment. \nIt comes as a blow to Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to win back support in traditional Labour heartlands.\nThe Tories are also making gains from Labour in English council elections.\nOn a walkabout in Hartlepool with the victorious Tory candidate, Boris Johnson said her win was a \"mandate for us to continue to deliver\" for the north-east of England and the rest of the country.\n\"If there is a lesson out of this whole election campaign across the whole of the UK is that the public want us to get on with focusing on their needs and their priorities, coming through the pandemic and making sure we build back better,\" added the prime minister.\nSir Keir said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the results.\nThe Labour leader said the party had \"lost the trust of working people, particularly in places like Hartlepool,\" but added: \"I will take full responsibility for fixing things.\"\nHe said Labour had \"not made a strong enough case to the country\" and he promised to set out changes in the next few days to help the party \"reconnect\" with lost voters.\nThe Hartlepool constituency was formed in 1974 and had returned a Labour MP in every vote since - until Thursday's poll.\nMs Mortimer hailed it as a \"truly historic\" result, adding: \"Not only that, I am the first woman ever to be elected as MP for this town.\n\"Labour have taken people in Hartlepool for granted for too long.\n\"I heard this time and time again on the doorstep and people have had enough and now, through this result, the people have spoken and have made it clear it is time for change.\"\nDiane Abbott, an ally of Sir Keir Starmer's predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: \"Crushing defeat for Labour in Hartlepool. Not possible to blame Jeremy Corbyn for this result. Labour won the seat twice under his leadership. Keir Starmer must think again about his strategy.\"\nAnother Corbyn ally, union boss Len McCluskey, warned Labour faced a \"continuous downward decline\" unless Sir Keir started \"talking about the radical alternative for ordinary working people\".\n\"People don't know what his vision is. People don't know what Labour stand for anymore,\" said the Unite general secretary.\nHe told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast he did not trust Sir Keir and had not spoken to him since Mr Corbyn's expulsion from the Parliamentary party last year.\nMr Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, tweeted: \"With millions not voting, these results show a loss of hope.  \n\"We must offer a bolder vision to transform people's lives and give them the confidence to strive for a more equal world.\"\nBut key figures from the centrist wing of the party say the Hartlepool defeat, which saw a 16% swing from Labour to the Conservatives, showed Labour had not changed enough.\nLord Adonis, who served under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the party was in \"no man's land\" under Sir Keir, who he described as a \"transitional leader\".\nHe warned \"it could be curtains for Labour\" unless it became a \"modernising, centrist, dynamic\" party.\nAnd former Hartlepool MP Lord Mandelson said it was clear from his conversations with voters in the town that Mr Corbyn was \"still casting a very dark cloud over Labour\" and that the party had more work to do put that era behind it.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Hartlepool defeat was down to \"two Cs: Covid and Corbyn\".\nLabour's loss of Hartlepool in a by-election is the most dramatic illustration yet that the party has so far failed to connect with the Leave-supporting, working class voters they lost heavily in 2017 and 2019. \nSupport for the Brexit Party, which registered 26% in Hartlepool in 2019, collapsed - the successor Reform party secured just 1% of the vote. \nIt looks as though the Conservatives picked up the Brexit Party's former support, in line with the proportion of Leave voters preferring the Conservatives to Labour to the order of 3/4 to 1.\nHowever, the swing to the Conservatives of 16% is more than can be accounted for by the collapse of the Brexit Party. \nLabour's vote fell 9 points to 29%, so the party clearly lost some of its 2019 support, as well as suffering from the movement of Brexit Party voters to the Conservatives. \nPart of the explanation may lie in the success of independent candidate, Sam Lee, who won 10% of the vote.\nTogether with the pattern in key wards there is clearly a debate about whether Labour can win support from Leave voters by ignoring Brexit as it has in the past 12 months. \nThe Conservative gain of Northumberland council is a further illustration of the success of the Conservatives in Leave voting areas. \nConservative Ms Mortimer won with 15,529 votes, while Labour's Mr Williams received 8,589.\nThe Hartlepool seat came back into contention after its former Labour MP, Mike Hill, resigned in March.\nThe by-election was one of a raft of elections taking place across Britain on Thursday, with voters picking representatives for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd, as well as mayors and local councils in England, and police and crime commissioners.\nThe result is more evidence of the long term shift in politics where areas that had chosen Labour for decades were less and less convinced.\nThat didn't start with Boris Johnson and didn't even start with Brexit.\nThe success of the vaccine programme has no doubt helped the Tories.\nBut Keir Starmer has questions to answer as well."

      "tags": "Grand Canyon,Bison,United States",
      "text": "Over 45,000 people have applied to cull bison in the Grand Canyon after the US National Park Service (NPS) requested volunteers to help with overpopulation.\nThe famed national park in Arizona is seeking 12 \"skilled volunteers\" to reduce the herd, which has grown large enough to cause environmental damage.\nThe event is not being classified as a \"hunt\", as hunting is forbidden in US national parks.\nSome environmentalists have warned the move could set a dangerous precedent.\nThe lottery opened on Monday and closed after 48 hours with 45,040 applicants. \nAn initial 25 names will be selected. After being vetted by park officials for skills including marksmanship, 12 people will be given the opportunity to kill a bison in the park's North Rim area.\nVolunteers are permitted to bring a support crew along, according to the NPS rules. Bison can weigh over 2,000lbs (900kg), but the sharp-shooters must carry out any meat on foot without the help of motorised transport or pack animals.\nThe event will take place in rugged, rocky and sometimes snowy terrain, with elevations exceeding 8,000ft (2,440m).\nOfficials say the pilot programme is required after the herd rapidly grew to 600 bison in recent years. The NPS hopes to bring the herd residing on the North Rim down to about 200 in order to reduce trampling of Native American archaeological sites, soil erosion and water contamination.\nBefore being hunted to near-extinction in the 19th Century, bison (which are also known in the US as buffalo) roamed across much of the continent. An estimated 30 to 60 million bison were reduced to only about 400 by the late 1800s.\nBut environmentalists say there is little evidence that the Grand Canyon was ever part of their historic range.\nAccording to historians, the North Rim herd was introduced to the area after a frontiersman's failed attempt to interbreed bison with cattle in the early 1900s."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Most adults under the age of 40 will be given an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to a link with rare blood clots. \nThe UK's medicines safety regulator says there have been 242 clotting cases and 49 deaths, with 28.5 million doses of the vaccine administered. \nBut the risk is slightly higher in younger age groups. \nLow levels of coronavirus cases and the availability of alternative vaccines have also informed the decision. \nProf Wei Shen Lim, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said they were putting \"a high priority on safety\" and he expected the move would \"serve to boost confidence\" in the vaccination programme. \nImmunisation is estimated to have already saved 10,000 lives in the UK.\nHe added: \"As Covid-19 rates continue to come under control, we are advising that adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine.\"\nIt comes as two-thirds of over-18s in the UK have now had a first dose - about 35 million people - and 31.8% or nearly 16.8 million have had both doses, according to the latest government figures.\nA further 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were reported on Friday, and there were 2,490 new confirmed cases.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to distinctive, but rare, blood clots that also appear with low levels of platelets (which help clots form) in the blood.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, but rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Two in a million people in their 40s died rising to four per million people in their 30s. \nAt the same time, the risks of developing severe Covid, if you catch the virus, fall in younger age groups. \nDr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said the benefits continued to outweigh the risks for the \"vast majority of people\".\nShe added: \"The balance of benefits and risks is very favourable for older people, but is more finely balanced for younger people.\"\nThe supply of alternative vaccines, including Pfizer and Moderna, has made the decision possible. \nThe vaccination programme has also been unexpectedly successful in reducing the spread of the virus. This has changed projections for a \"third wave\" later in the year meaning the risk to younger adults is less than previously anticipated.\nMost clots were after the first dose and people who have already had one dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca are advised to still have the second.\nHowever, some under 40s will still be offered the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as it is easier to both transport and store, making it more practical than the alternatives. \nAll adults are still expected to be offered their first dose of a vaccine by the end of July. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "GCHQ,Cyber-attacks",
      "text": "Smart cities will be a target for hackers, and councils need to be prepared, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned.\nSensors and internet-connected devices may improve urban services, but could also be used by hackers and foreign states to disrupt or spy.\nThe NCSC - an arm of GCHQ - has published guidance for local authorities on how to secure what they call \"connected places\".\nThey warn that critical public services will need to be protected from disruption.\nSensitive data also needs to be secured from being stolen in large volumes.  \nSmart cities and connected rural environments promise a host of benefits. Sensors will monitor pollution or offer real-time information on parking. Cameras will track congestion and manage traffic flow. \nThis should help improve efficiency, and help local authorities become more sustainable. \nBut the growing dependency on technology also brings risks. The NCSC is warning of possible \"destructive impacts\" if systems were switched off which, in some cases, could even \"endanger\" residents. \nAnother concern is that the large volumes of data about people that are collected could erode privacy by allowing citizens to be tracked even more, or could be stolen by criminals or hostile states.\nThe NCSC's technical director, Dr Ian Levy, claims that one of the first Hollywood depictions of a cyber-attack was against critical infrastructure. \nHe points not to a recent James Bond film but the 1969 classic 'The Italian Job' in which a computer professor (played by Benny Hill) switches magnetic storage tapes running traffic in the Italian city of Turin, in order to create gridlock which allows a haul of gold to be stolen.\n\"A similar 'gridlock' attack on a 21st century city would have catastrophic impacts on the people who live and work there, and criminals wouldn't likely need physical access to the traffic control system to do it,\" Dr Levy warns in a blog.\n\"These connected physical environments are just emerging in the UK, so now is the time to make sure we're designing and building them properly,\" Dr Levy writes.\nThe new principles advise local authorities on how to design and manage their systems to protect data and ensure they are resilient. \nThey do not explicitly name any countries or groups likely to carry out an attack. But they do warn about the risks in the context of suppliers of the technology. \nChina has been at the leading edge of developing smart cities technology, deploying it within its own borders, but also exporting equipment to other countries.\n\"Some countries seek to obtain sensitive commercial and personal data from overseas, including from the UK,\" the guidance warns. \n\"They may also seek the potential to cause disruption to overseas services. \n\"Suppliers that are part of corporate groups based in these countries may be subject to influence from those governments to access and exfiltrate data from UK-connected places, in support of those countries' security and intelligence services. \n\"Such suppliers may also be used as a vector for an attempt to take down an essential service,\" the guidance warns. \nThe head of GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, highlighted the risks last month when he warned that the West faced a moment of reckoning when it came to China, and a battle over what values would be embedded in technology.\n\"If we don't control the technology, if we don't understand the security required to implement those effectively, then we'll end up with an environment or technology ecosystem where the data is not only used to navigate, but it could be used to track us,\" he told the BBC.

      "tags": "Scottish Parliament election 2021,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. \nThe party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives.\nIt also won the East Lothian seat from Labour.\nBut it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday.\nNo other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one.\nBut the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday.\nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament.\nAnd he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. \nThe Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.\nClick or tap to explore results\nAs the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. \nFriday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. \nMs Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016.\nTurnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. \nMs Sturgeon said that the SNP \"appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again\".\nShe pledged to \"get back to work immediately\" and lead the country's Covid recovery.\n\"And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,\" she added.\nIt comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be \"irresponsible and reckless\" right now.\nAsked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he told the Daily Telegraph: \"I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. \n\"I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want.\"\nHowever deputy first minister John Swinney told BBC Breakfast that his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one.\nHe said: \"We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament.\"\nMr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the \"electoral arithmetic\" of the final results, he was \"very confident\" there would be a majority of candidates \"elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence\".\nThis election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. \nWhile the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. \nTo achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. \nThere is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. \nIf the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. \nTogether the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. \nA big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. \nThe constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats.\nThe Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP.\nAnd Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. \nThe election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence.\nThe SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2.\nAlthough it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant that traditional overnight counting was impossible, with the results instead being announced over the course of Friday and Saturday.\nA record number of people had already cast their ballots by post before the polls opened on Thursday morning - with more than a million having registered  for postal ballots.\nOther elections also took place across the UK on Thursday, including for the Welsh Parliament, 143 English councils and 13 local mayors, as well as a by-election for the Westminster seat of Hartlepool in the north east of England - which was won by the Conservatives from Labour.\nSIGN UP FOR SCOTLAND ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage"

      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared a picture of their son Archie to mark his second birthday.\nThe sepia-toned picture, taken on Thursday, shows the toddler standing in a garden with his back to the camera, holding a large bunch of balloons.\nIt was shared on their Archewell website, along with a plea for donations to a fund for Covid vaccinations in poor nations.\nThe Queen and other members of the Royal Family sent birthday messages. \nA message from the Royal Family's official Twitter account said: \"Wishing Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a very happy 2nd birthday today.\"\nThe post was shared alongside a picture of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their son days after he was born. \nIn a statement on their Archewell foundation website, Prince Harry and Meghan - who are expecting their second child - said they were \"deeply touched\" by people who had donated to charities in honour of Archie's birthday in previous years.\nThey urged people to support GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, saying: \"We will not be able to truly recover until everyone, everywhere, has equal access to the vaccine.\n\"We cannot think of a more resonant way to honour our son's birthday. If we all show up, with compassion for those we both know and don't know, we can have a profound impact.\" \nMeanwhile, the duke and duchess also wrote an open letter to major Covid vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, urging them to redouble support for the UN-sponsored Covax programme distributing doses in poorer parts of the world.\nAnd as momentum builds around a US-backed proposal to waive vaccine patents, Harry and Meghan called on the firms to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines.\nArchie lives with his parents in California, following Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior royals and move to the US. \nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Archie's uncle and aunt, along with his grandparents the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, also posted birthday messages from their Twitter accounts. \nAlongside their message, Charles and his wife shared a photo of the Prince of Wales with Harry and Archie at his christening. \nArchie, the Sussexes' first child, was born on 6 May 2019 weighing 7lbs 3oz. \nHe is seventh in line to the throne and does not have a title.\nFor Archie's first birthday, the Sussexes released a video of Meghan reading the popular children's book, Duck! Rabbit!, to her son.  \nHe has rarely been seen in public but last December made a surprise appearance in the couple's first podcast for Spotify, during which he was heard speaking with an American accent. \nIt comes after Meghan revealed she was publishing a children's book about father-son relationships, inspired by the bond between Archie and the duke.\nIn February the couple announced they were expecting their second child. \nPrince Harry was last in the UK in April for the funeral of his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. However, Meghan stayed in California on the advice of her doctor. \nThe Sussexes stepped back as senior royals and said they would work to become financially independent last March.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Lee."

      "text": "The polls have closed across Britain in the biggest set of votes since the 2019 general election.\nThroughout Thursday, voters picked representatives for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd as well as mayors and local councils in England. \nVoters in England and Wales also voted for police and crime commissioners. \nThe results are due to come in over the next few days - with the outcome of the Hartlepool by-election expected on Friday morning.\nBut Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, has already admitted defeat over the Westminster seat, telling the BBC his party \"hasn't got over the line\".\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, elections in 2020 were postponed - leading to a particularly large set of polls taking place this year. \nThe elections are Sir Keir Starmer's first major political test since becoming Labour leader a year ago. \nThe results will give an indication of whether the party is recovering from its heavy defeat in the 2019 general elections.\nConservatives hope to build on their success in the general election, when they were able to flip several constituencies previously considered Labour strongholds.\nBoth parties will be closely watching the result of the by-election in Hartlepool - a seat currently held by Labour.\nBut the BBC's political editor in the North East, Richard Moss, said it appeared that the party's majority of 3,595 has been \"whittled away\" by the Tories in Thursday's poll and they could be on course for a \"significant win\".\nLabour's Mr McMahon told the BBC: \"It's quite clear when we see the ballots landing on the table that we just haven't got over the line on the day\u2026 that's clearly very disappointing.\"\nIn Scotland, the results will give an indication of the public level of support for a second independence referendum, as proposed by the SNP.\nMeanwhile, the Welsh Labour party are aiming to remain the largest party in the Senedd, where they have held power since the parliament was founded in 1999.\nThe winner of the Hartlepool by-election is expected early on Friday.\nResults for the 60 seats in the Welsh Senedd are due later the same day.\nIn Scotland, counting starts on Friday, but a final result is not expected until Saturday or Sunday. \nCounting in council areas in England will take place on Friday, and throughout the weekend in some areas.\nBut a few early results are coming in overnight, with Labour holding control of Newcastle and Sunderland, while the Conservatives kept control of Redditch. \nThe Tories have also won overall control of Harlow Council in Essex, taking seven seats from Labour, and now control the council for Nuneaton and Bedworth, taking 10 seats from Labour. \nDoncaster is likely to be the first mayoral race to be announced - potentially early on Friday morning - with the rest following later in the day and over Saturday and Sunday.  \nTwelve of the counts for the 39 police and crime commissioners being elected in England will not begin until Monday.\nThe BBC News website will have all the results as they are announced, with live results, and live pages with the latest reaction and analysis from our correspondents.\nThe BBC's Election 2021 results programme will kick off at 09:00 BST on Friday and run until 22:00 BST on the BBC News Channel and BBC iPlayer. \nIt will also be available on BBC Two in the morning and BBC One from 14:30-18:00.\nBBC local radio stations will carry results and analysis throughout the day on Friday and into the weekend, with special programmes across the network.

      "text": "Scots have cast their ballots in the Holyrood election, but don't need to stay up all night as Covid-19 restrictions have put paid to the usual overnight count. With votes to be tallied across Friday and Saturday, when will you know the result in your local area - and when will the overall winners be declared?\nCounting will kick off from 09:00 on Friday morning, with the Electoral Management Board projecting 48 of the 73 constituencies to be tallied that day.\nThe full lists can be found here, or you can look up your local results here: \nFriday's constituencies include both the most marginal and safest seats from 2016, and eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats.\nThese include the Labour defences of Dumbarton, Edinburgh Southern and East Lothian, none of which have a majority exceeding 3%, and the Conservative seats in Ayr, Edinburgh Central, Dumfriesshire and Eastwood.\nIf the SNP manage to pick off the lion's share of these seats, they will feel good about going into Saturday and winning a majority.\nThis will particularly be the case if they can gain ground without suffering defeats in any of their own more marginal seats - Angus North & Mearns, Moray and Perthshire North are those with single-digit majorities.\nThe reverse is also true of course - if the SNP struggle to gain many of these marginal seats or lose some of their own, the path to a majority narrows.\nBy the end of Friday, it should be fairly clear which way the wind is blowing - but there will still be plenty to play for on Saturday.\nIf all goes well on Friday, the remaining 25 constituencies will count on Saturday - with the most marginal contests being between the SNP and Conservatives.\nThe most marginal constituencies to count on Saturday are again SNP-Tory contests, with the SNP hoping to pick off Aberdeenshire West and Galloway&West Dumfries, both with majorities under 5%.\nThere are a few chances for the Tories to fight back too, with the SNP defences of Perthshire South& Kinross-shire, Edinburgh Pentlands and Aberdeen South and North Kincardine all having single-digit majorities.\nOnce each region has declared all of its constituencies, we will also start to get results from the regional lists - which could be pivotal for the overall result, as well as questions over who claims second place and the fate of smaller parties.\nBefore we turn to the regional results, a quick note on how they are worked out.\nScotland is divided into eight electoral regions, with the 73 constituency seats scattered across them. Each region elects an extra seven MSPs from lists submitted by the parties - voted for via the peach ballot paper - giving a total of 129.\nThe idea of the list system is to make the outcome of the election more proportional. \nOnce the constituency results have been declared, you divide the number of list votes each party has won by the number of seats they have already won in that region, plus one. So if a party has won nine seats in an area already, their list vote tally is divided by 10 - making it 10 times harder for them to win a seat from the lists.\nThere has been particular focus on the list system in 2021 thanks to the emergence of some list-only parties which encourage tactical voting, leading to a debate over whether this is \"gaming the system\" or simply testing the limits of the rules.\nTimings for the counts remain very much up in the air, given we don't yet know how difficult it will prove to stack up ballots in line with Covid-19 restrictions.\nBut under current plans, with the exception of the big centres of Glasgow and Edinburgh, most of the count centres only have one constituency to finish off on the Saturday. \nThis means they could well finish up quickly - and indeed simultaneously, if there are similar numbers of ballots to count in each constituency.\nWhich regions will declare first?\nIt is hard to say, but the Highlands and Islands - normally one of the last regions to come back in an overnight count due to the vast and varied geography of the area - only has one seat to count on Saturday.\nSimilarly there will only be one seat left to count from the West Scotland region - so it is possible these two will be able to declare their full regional lists first.\nOther regions have at least a couple of constituencies still to polish off before they can run the equations and calculate list seats. Mid Scotland and Fife could be next in line with three seats to count, all at separate locations.\nHowever, this is largely guesswork, and a lot will depend on how the Covid-safe procedures play out at count centres. There will be four constituencies counting at the Emirates Area in Glasgow on Saturday, and three at Ingliston for the Lothian region.\nSouth Scotland also has four counts still to run on Saturday, as does North East Scotland - with two of the latter at P&J Live in Aberdeen, which may delay matters from a logistical standpoint."

      "text": "If you were faced with someone who'd just been stabbed, would you know how to help?\nTeenagers from the age of 14 in some areas of the UK will get training on how to help stab victims, in a new scheme launched by St John Ambulance.\nThe Young Responders initiative aims to give young people \"lifesaving first aid skills\" over the next two years.\nSt John Ambulance says street violence is a \"major concern\" at the moment.\nTraining will be given in London, Leeds and Manchester.\n\"We know that in the moment of handling an incident, adrenaline can take over,\" St John Ambulance says, in a statement.\n\"The practical\u00a0training\u00a0we provide means that the response can be more instinctive and help a young person make the difference to the person in need.\"\nIt also claims that stabbings often happen to people who feel they \"cannot ask for help\", because they would perhaps be worried about getting in trouble themselves if emergency services were called.\nOdane Cross runs a knife amnesty in Reading, encouraging young people to hand in weapons in exchange for a discount at his food takeaway company. \nHe thinks the The Young Responders scheme will be useful to young people already caught up in gang culture, who might not be quick to call 999.\n\"If their friend's been stabbed, but they've got a weapon on them, they'll be scared that if emergency services get called, they'll all get arrested\", he tells Newsbeat.\nIn an ideal world, training like this wouldn't be needed. But Odane says we need to work with the fact that knife crime is a reality.\nSince starting his knife amnesty three months ago, he says he has collected 69 knives, and only two of those were from over 18s. \nHe says: \"I had an 11-year-old give me in a machete the other day. They have no fear.\n\"His point of view was that if he kills someone, he'll only get 11 years, and he will be out by the time he's 22.\"\nIt's difficult to assess recent knife crime statistics, because figures dropped in lockdown.\nBut in the year ending June 2019, there were more than 22,000 disposals given to people who were carrying a knife or offensive weapon. \nA disposal is when police don't prosecute someone, because the crime is easier dealt with out of court.\nIn 20% of those cases, the person carrying the weapon was aged between 10 and 17.\nOdane says the scheme is a good idea.\n\"If kids knew what to do in these situations, I think more people would be surviving.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "text": "The rickety folding tables looked like they could hardly cope with the weight of votes for the Tory candidate, and now elected MP, Jill Mortimer, in Hartlepool. \nThe result: more evidence for the Conservatives that they are digging further and further into territory where once they were total outsiders. \nThey didn't just win here, they romped home. \nHartlepool, as it's constituted now, has never had a Tory MP. It's also unusual that governments win by-elections - they are often moments when voters remind the administration of the day who is really in charge. \nNot this time. \nBoris Johnson's party has also scooped up council seats in places like Harlow and Nuneaton, with swings - at what is still, remember, an early stage - that give the impression the Tories really are consolidating their dominance in England. \nDespite a bumpy few weeks, it's a reminder for the Tory party of Mr Johnson's record as an election winner. \nThe Hartlepool result is not a surprise for Labour. And it's important to remember that about 10,000 people voted for the Brexit Party in 2019 there, and at an early glance it seemed many of those voters switched across to the Tories. \nBut that doesn't mean it's not a setback. The result is more evidence of the long term shift in politics where areas that had chosen Labour for decades were less and less convinced.  \nThat didn't start with Boris Johnson and didn't even start with Brexit.  \nThe success of the vaccine programme has no doubt helped the Tories too.  \nBut Keir Starmer has questions to answer as well, even if results for his party in places like Trafford or Crawley come good in the long results process in the coming days. Why was a strong Remain candidate chosen for a seat were voters were massively in favour of leaving the EU? \nWould the party have been wiser to choose to hold the by-election on a different day to the Britain-wide ballots? \nBut beyond the local circumstances, even some of his allies would admit privately, the leadership has struggled to come up with a really compelling message that can grab voters, that magic ingredient that turns competent politicians into winners. \nThere'll be likely strife from the left in the next few days - several MPs, including Diane Abbott and Richard Burgon, front benchers under Jeremy Corbyn, already tweeting calls for a change in direction. One former member of the NEC this morning has even told me that the leader has to go.\nBut if anything, expect Starmer's team to make the case more aggressively that the party needs to change. Don't be surprised if there is a reshuffle, and a punchier approach to his critics on the left on the other side.\nRemember in all this however, we are in the early hours of a complicated and extensive set of elections. A lot still could change."

      "text": "Voting has officially closed for the Welsh Parliamentary elections as some people had to queue outside polling stations to cast their vote.\nLong queues were seen outside some polling stations in the final hours before the ballot closed at 22:00 BST.\nWhile counting for the poll would normally take place overnight, due to the coronavirus pandemic it will start on Friday morning.\nThe first result is expected to be declared on Friday afternoon.\nPolling stations opened at 07:00 on Thursday for people to vote for the new 60 members of the Senedd to make up the Welsh Parliament - and for the next Police and Crime Commissioners.\nFor the first time 16 and 17-year-olds had the right to vote in Wales - but only in the Senedd election.\nWith social distancing measures in place - and limited space for people inside polling stations due to strict Covid rules - long queues were seen outside a number of polling stations as the deadline approached.\nHowever, rules mean that anyone who joined a queue to vote before 22:00 will still be able to cast their ballot after they close, and those in line were handed cards to ensure they could vote.\nBBC reporters outside polling stations reported queues of more than an hour for people to get inside to cast their votes.\nSome took to twitter to say they had tried to vote but with long-queues some said they had no choice but to leave the line due to childcare or having to go to work.\nIn Cardiff, a long line of people were seen queueing outside Victoria Park polling station, while in Roath people were seen lining the street to cast their ballot.\nWriting on twitter, Frank Sanders said he had tried to vote twice, but had been forced to give up both times due to the length of the queues outside Broad Street polling station.\n\"The queue was too long for me to get back to work this morning and then to get up to work tomorrow. Helpfully eliminating a lot of working voters,\" he tweeted.\nOn Friday you can follow comprehensive coverage as the votes for the Senedd election are counted and the results declared across BBC Wales' online, television and radio services.\nThe police and crime commissioner (PCC) votes will be counted on Sunday.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nAfter the polls officially closed Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford, who was first minister in the previous Welsh government, thanked 16 and 17 year olds who had \"exercised their new right to vote for the first time\". \n\"In the coming days, the political make-up of the next Senedd will become clear. We await those results,\" he said.\nVoters had cast their ballot to elect 40 Members of the Senedd (MSs) representing local constituencies, and 20 representing five large regions - North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East.\nThe regions elect four MSs each.\nVoters had got two ballots - one to back a candidate in their constituency, and one to support a party list of candidates or individual in their region.\nIn the constituency ballots the candidate with the most votes wins, the same system used at UK general elections.\nBut the ballot for the region is decided by a mathematical process in which people are elected more according to their share of the vote.\nThe system takes into account who has won the constituency seats within that region and gives parties winning fewer or none of those constituencies a better chance of winning regional ones.\nThe party or combination of parties that can command the greatest support in the Senedd after the election will form the next Welsh government.\nIn police and crime commissioner elections you can vote for a first and second choice candidate.\nIf no candidate gets more than 50% of the first choice votes, all except the top two candidates are eliminated.\nIf your first choice candidate is eliminated, and your second choice is for one of the top two, your second choice is counted.\nElections were also held on Thursday for the Scottish Parliament, and London's mayor and assembly.\nIn England, PCC elections took place and voters went to the polls to elect local councils and directly elected mayors. There was also a by-election to choose a new MP at Westminster for Hartlepool. "

      "text": "Labour is losing ground to the Conservatives in elections across England, in the first big test of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of the party.\nThe first blow for Labour came when the Tories took a Westminster seat from it in the Hartlepool by-election.\nIt has also lost control of several councils, while the Conservatives have made gains. \nAnd the Tories won more than 70% of the mayoral vote in Tees Valley - an area that used to vote Labour.\nSir Keir said he was \"bitterly disappointed\", but pledged to lead a fightback for his party and to set out a \"bold vision\" in the next few days.\nMore than half the results from Thursday's English council elections have been announced.\nThe rest, as well as those for mayoral and police and crime commissioner contests, will continue to come in through over the weekend.\nAmong the details so far, the Conservatives have taken Pendle, Maidstone, Cornwall, Nottinghamshire, Basildon, Northumberland, Dudley, and Nuneaton and Bedworth councils from no overall control.\nThey also took control of of Harlow council, in Essex, from Labour.\nAnd Labour has lost Sheffield, Plymouth and Rossendale to no overall control.\nThe Green Party has increased its number of seats across England, while the Conservatives lost Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Wight to no overall control.\nConservative Ben Houchen was re-elected mayor of Tees Valley, which includes Hartlepool, receiving 73% of the vote. This involved a swing from Labour to his party of 23%.\nMr Houchen said there was \"pride returning\" to the area, adding that it was \"not true\" that the government had pumped lots of money into it over the past few years only because it was run by a Conservative.\nPolling expert Sir John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said \"what was once traditional Labour territory\" in north-eastern England had \"now been well and truly painted blue\".\nEngland is electing 143 councils, 13 mayors.\nIt is also choosing 35 police and crime commissioners, of which the Conservatives have so far gained three, for Dorset, Cleveland and Avon and Somerset.\nThe prime minister described results declared so far as \"very encouraging\" for the Conservatives.\n\"I think that's really because we have been focusing, as a government, on our priorities, the people's priorities, and bouncing back from the pandemic as much as we can and getting through it,\" he added.\nClick or tap to explore map\nSir Keir offered a stark assessment of Labour's performance, which follows its worst general election outcome since the 1930s in 2019.\nHe told the BBC the party, which he has led for just over a year, had \"lost the trust of working people, particularly in places like Hartlepool\", adding: \"We have not made a strong enough case to the country.\"\nHe said that he intended to take \"responsibility for fixing things\".\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the party under Sir Keir for \"offering nothing\" but \"insipid support for the government\".\n\"We have to make a very clear pitch for what real social justice would look like,\" he told Channel 4 News. \"You don't succeed in beating the government if you agree with their strategy.\"\nBut Labour has won some key votes, including in Doncaster, where Ros Jones was re-elected as mayor.\nIt has also retained control of councils including Liverpool, Manchester, Hastings and Exeter.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, whose party has lost a few seats with more than half of councils still to declare their results, said it was \"moving forwards and making progress\".\nReacting to the gain in seats in Cambridgeshire, he added: \"If you want to beat the Conservatives, it's the Liberal Democrats that can do it.\"\nEngland is seeing a bumper set of local council elections this year, after polls in 2020 were postponed due to the pandemic.\nIn Scotland, parliamentary results will give an indication of the public level of support for a second independence referendum, as proposed by the SNP.\nMeanwhile, Welsh Labour is aiming to remain the largest party in the Senedd, where it has held power since the parliament was founded in 1999."

      "text": "At least 25 people including a police officer have been killed in a shootout in Rio de Janeiro, according to local media. \nThe shootout took place during a police operation in a favela in the Jacarezinho area of the city. \nPolice launched the operation after receiving reports that drug traffickers were recruiting children for their gang. \nTwo passengers on a metro train were hit by bullets but survived. \nPolice in the Brazilian city confirmed the death of one of their officers, Inspector Andre Leonardo de Mello Frias. A statement on Facebook said \"he honoured the profession he loved and will be missed\". \nPolice Chief Ronaldo Oliveira told Reuters news agency that Thursday's raid was \"the largest number of deaths in a police operation in Rio\". \nAccording to local news, the gang targeted in this raid engages in drug trafficking, mugging, murders and kidnappings. \nTelevision images showed suspects trying to escape across rooftops as police entered the favela. \nMeanwhile, residents of Jacarezinho have shared accounts of what they witnessed on social media.\nOne resident posted a photo of his blood-covered floor and said two people had died in his house as police chased the criminals. The man, who did not want to give his name, said he would try to move out of the area as soon as possible. \n\"We're trying to sell the house as fast as possible, we can't continue to live here,\" he said. \nOther residents said officers had seized their phones, accusing them of warning gang members of the raid. \nSociology professor Ignacio Cano from the Laboratory for the Analysis of Violence at Rio State University dismissed the reasons the police gave for the raid: \"To say that drug traffickers recruit children and teenagers to deal drugs is almost laughable because everyone knows that these gangs have minors who work for them. \n\"To say that you're going to launch a massive raid because you've discovered that traffickers recruit children is a joke,\" he told O Dia newspaper. \nRio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states and vast areas are under the control of criminals, many of them linked to powerful drug-trafficking gangs. \nSecurity forces in Brazil have often been accused of excessive use of force against the civilian population during anti-crime operations in major cities. \nA court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods of Rio during the pandemic unless it was deemed essential. \nRio de Janeiro is the city with the biggest percentage of people living in shanty towns in Brazil - 22%. It's a population of 1,3 million, 70% of which are black. \nAnalysis by Camilla Motta, BBC Brasil reporter, Sao Paulo\nPolice operations targeting favelas controlled by drug traffickers are quite common in Rio. This, however, is the deadliest operation since 2016.\nSince a court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods in Rio, the number of deaths in shootouts in favelas has fallen. \nIn the first month alone, deaths plummeted 70% when compared to the average recorded since 2007, according to the research group Grupo de Estudos dos Novos Ilegalismos, from Universidade Federal Fluminense. \nThe drop was not followed by a rise in crime. In fact, property crimes were down by 40% and homicides by 48%. Researchers argue this shows that police operations are not the best strategy to tackle crime. "

But much of the country has just shown again that he is a magnet for millions of voters.\nLove it, or loathe it, which other political leader can you imagine having the bottle to pose next to a giant inflatable blimp of themselves?\nAs his political opponents have found to their frustration in Westminster, the prime minister's prowess as a campaigner sucks oxygen from everyone else - and goodness knows it must have taken a lot of puff to blow up that inflatable.\nIn contrast, Sir Keir Starmer has just enjoyed a few weeks of making the running in SW1. But much of the country has demonstrated once more that Labour turns swathes of voters away.\nCaution is still wise, hordes of results are yet to come, and for both of the big parties, and particularly the prime minister, the outcome of the Scottish results is possibly the start of a brand new nightmare.\nAs things stand, the chances of the SNP taking a majority all on its own are in the balance.\nWhatever the final details of the result, the situation is likely to be fraught - stand by for a battle of the mandates.\nAnd all the parties have to grapple with the particularities of the electoral map. Whether it's the different scenario in Scotland, or contrasting results for Labour in Wales and England, or town and city, young and old, the jigsaw is becoming more, not less, complicated.\nFor the primary Westminster battle, however, it's clear the Tories have trampled further into areas where they used to be alien, more reward from a long-term strategy.\nLabour, even with its new leader who has been consistently at pains to show the party is different under his stewardship, has to grapple with a new horror - the thumping in 2019 under Jeremy Corbyn may not have been rock bottom.\nElections record only one moment in time - but these results shape the mood, the psychology of our political parties.\nFor the Tories, more than a decade in power already, they're defying gravity - these results argue for more of the same. \nFor Labour, the urge to change is more urgent - quite how is no easier to say.

      "text": "The electorate have now cast their votes to elect members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). \nThe poll is now held every five years, and this will be the sixth election in its history.\nIt was established in 1999 to debate issues and make laws for Scotland.\nA total of 129 MSPs are elected to the Parliament - often referred to as Holyrood, after the area of Edinburgh where the parliament building stands.\nThey debate and pass laws on devolved issues - these include most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as education, health and transport. \nSCOTLAND ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nHolyrood also has control over some taxes, most notably income tax, and some areas of the welfare system.\nThe UK Parliament at Westminster can pass laws on reserved matters, which are generally those with a UK-wide or international impact - such as defence, foreign policy and immigration.\nAnyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election and have not been legally excluded from voting (for example because they are serving a prison sentence of longer than 12 months).\nThey must also be a British or Irish citizen or a citizen of another country living in Scotland who has permission to enter or stay in the UK, or who does not need permission.\nPeople have two votes - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot.\nThere are 73 Constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency.  \nIn the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. \nThere are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are: \nThis means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region.\nThe Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. \nIt is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance.\nIn previous elections, votes were counted as soon as the polls closed at 22:00, with the results being announced overnight. \nThe pandemic means that the votes in this election will not start to be counted until the morning after, with a final result not expected until the weekend of 8/9 May.\nThe SNP, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, lost its overall majority in the 2016 election, but continued in power after forming a minority government.\nThe Scottish Conservatives - led by Ruth Davidson - finished second after overtaking Scottish Labour for the first time, while the Scottish Greens were fourth - ahead of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. \nThe SNP has won every Scottish Parliament election since 2007.\nThe election campaign is likely to be dominated by the question of whether there should be another referendum on Scottish independence. \nThe SNP has already said it wants to hold a vote once the Covid pandemic ends - if the election returns another pro-independence majority.\nThe Scottish Greens also back independence, but the Scottish Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats are all opposed and say the country's focus should be on recovering from the pandemic rather than the constitution.\nHealth, education, the environment and the economy are among the other important issues for voters, and all are likely to feature prominently during the campaign.\nSocial distancing rules mean the campaign will look and feel very different to normal.\nParty campaigners will not be able to knock on doors, for example, and there will be no large gatherings for set-piece events such as TV debates or manifesto launches. \nMuch of the campaign is likely to play out online instead, with BBC Scotland planning to hold two virtual debates. \nIt is also expected that more people than ever before will choose to vote by post rather than going to a polling place. \nThere are three ways to vote:\nThe deadline to register to vote is Monday 19 April.\nThe deadline to register for a postal vote is 6 April.\nThe deadline to register for a proxy vote is 27 April.\nYou can register to vote online.\nUse our concise manifesto guide to compare where the parties stand on key issues like Covid-19, independence and the environment."

      "text": "An inquiry into whether Donald Trump violated campaign financial law during the 2016 election has been dropped.\nThe case stemmed from an allegation that Mr Trump directed his former lawyer to pay Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, to stop her speaking out about an alleged affair.\nThe lawyer, Michael Cohen, was later jailed on multiple charges.\nThe regulatory agency tasked with enforcing campaign finance law announced the case closure Thursday.\nIt came after the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, became deadlocked on taking action at a closed-door meeting in February.\nThe vote came months after an internal report recommended that there was \"reason to believe\" Mr Trump's campaign had knowingly violated campaign finance law.\nTwo Republicans who voted to dismiss the case said they had concluded it would not be \"the best use of agency resources\" while two Democrat-aligned commissioners criticised their decision.\n\"To conclude that a payment, made 13 days before Election Day to hush up a suddenly newsworthy 10-year-old story, was not campaign-related, without so much as conducting an investigation, defies reality,\" they wrote in a letter.\nCohen previously testified under oath that Mr Trump had directed him to make the payment of $130,000 (\u00a3100,000) just days before the election. \nMr Trump has acknowledged reimbursing the payment but denied the affair and any wrongdoing regarding campaign laws. \n\"The hush money payment was done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump,\" Cohen said in a statement to The New York Times, responding to the case dismissal. \n\"Like me, Trump should have been found guilty. How the FEC committee could rule any other way is confounding.\"\nIn a statement issued through his website, Mr Trump thanked the commission for dropping what he described as a \"phony case against me...built on lies from Michael Cohen, a corrupt and convicted lawyer\".\nCohen, who once said he would take a bullet for Mr Trump, was given a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to multiple offences in 2018, including violating campaign finance laws and lying to Congress.\nLegal wrangling over the allegations involving Ms Daniels, who alleges she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006, were ongoing throughout the Trump presidency.

      "text": "The travel industry has expressed disappointment that so few countries are on the UK government's green list for travel, describing the announcement as \"overly cautious\".\nThe traffic light system means travel abroad from 17 May will not be illegal.\nThe 12 green list countries, which include Portugal, Gibraltar and Israel, will not require people to quarantine on return to England.\nFirms said leaving the US off the list would risk the UK \"falling behind\".\nTravel to amber or red lists countries is not advised.\nThe change in travel rules applies to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel rules.\nOnly four of the countries on the green list are in Europe, and Portugal is the only large holiday destination from the continent on the list. \nIsrael and Singapore are also included, but Australia and New Zealand - which are approved as safe by the UK government - are not currently allowing in visitors from abroad.\nFrance, Greece, Italy and Spain, normally hugely popular holiday destinations for UK travellers, are not included on the safe list.\nAndrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm TUI, said: \"While we were expecting to see just a handful of destinations on the green list, this is an overly cautious start.\"\nAirlines UK, representing UK carriers, described it as \"a missed opportunity\" and \"a reopening of air travel in name only\" which left the UK \"at risk of falling behind\".\nAnd Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: \"The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science, and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy.\"\nUK citizens risked missing out on bookings for hotels if other European tourists were permitted to travel, he added.  \nMaking the announcement, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the easing of restrictions was \"necessarily cautious\" in the light of the threat from new variants of Covid-19.\nHe said the UK's success in combating the virus was not matched in many other countries.\nHowever he said the list would be reviewed every three weeks by the Joint Biosecurity Centre - the team set up last year to monitor the threat from the virus.\nSome firms had hoped the rapid roll out of the vaccination programme in the US would allow summer travel to resume there more quickly.\n\"There is no reason for the US to be absent from the green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the UK's successful vaccination programme,\" a spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic - one of the airlines which relies heavily on UK-US traffic - said.\n\"A transatlantic travel corridor is vital to deliver a much-needed boost to economic recovery,\" the spokesperson added.\nBut British Airways predicted that more countries would be included before the summer.\n\"What's clear is that with high levels of vaccination in the UK being matched by other countries, we should see more destinations going 'green' before the end of June,\" BA chief executive Sean Doyle said.\n\"We cannot stress more greatly that the UK urgently needs travel between it and other low-risk countries like the US, to re-start the economy, support devastated industries and reunite loved ones.\"\nMeanwhile, Ryanair, Easyjet, Tui and British Airways all said they would be increasing their flights to Portugal and other destinations on the green list. \nTourist-dependent firms in Portugal were quick to welcome the news.\n\"No-one enjoys a holiday more than the British people,\" said Miguel Campino, owner of Maria's Restaurant - a beach venue on Praia do Garr\u00e3o Poente.\n\"They bring a colourful atmosphere to all the restaurants, bars and hotels. This is a happy moment for everyone, for Portugal, for England... it's great news.\"\nJo\u00e3o Fernandes, president of the Algarve Tourism Bureau, also said the region was ready to welcome UK visitors back.\n\"We are obviously delighted with the news,\" he said. \"It's a recognition of the remarkable work Portugal has done in reducing levels of Covid to be able to restart the economy safely.\"\nIt comes as ministers continue talks with Uefa about holding the Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City in the UK, after host nation Turkey was added to England's travel red list.\nFrom 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, travellers from Turkey, as well as those from the Maldives and Nepal, will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast that the UK had offered to host the match but that it would \"ultimately be a decision for Uefa\".\nHowever, the UK consumer body Which? warned that practical difficulties over taking a holiday abroad would remain.\n\"Travellers will have an expectation that these new government rules should protect their health and their money, yet serious issues around lengthy airport queues and a broken testing system remain unresolved,\" Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said.\nAlthough international travel has been heavily restricted since January, returning travellers have experienced long delays at border control when arriving at Heathrow, sometimes waiting for up to six hours. \nPrivate firms offering Covid tests to returning travellers have been criticised for failing to deliver tests and results on time. \n\"Travellers should also be aware that there is still some financial risk involved in booking travel plans, depending on how you book and which company you choose,\" said Mr Boland.\n\"In a summer when further disruption can be expected, travel companies must be honest about the risks holidaymakers may be taking on. Crucially, holidaymakers also need to do their research before booking, as choosing the right provider could be the difference between getting hundreds of pounds back or just getting the run-round.\"\nA further 15 deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Friday, bringing the total to 127,598. There were 2,490 new cases.\nMore than 35 million first doses of a coronavirus vaccine have been given and more than 16.7 million second doses."
