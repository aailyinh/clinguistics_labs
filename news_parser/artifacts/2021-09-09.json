      "title": "Government to shorten HGV driver testing process",
      "tags": "Global supply chain management,Freight transport,Haulage",
      "text": "The government is expected to announce a shake-up of the HGV driver testing process as soon as Thursday.\nIt wants to fast track drivers into the haulage industry amid chronic shortages which have caused supply problems.  \nThe BBC understands that during meetings between government officials, hauliers and suppliers, the \"penny finally dropped\" that the driver shortage was getting worse not better.\nThe government said meetings with affected groups were ongoing.\nIt added any change in policy would be announced in due course.  \nWidespread supply chain issues caused by the driver shortage have hit a range of sectors, including food, drink and medicines. \n\"The government seem to finally understand the scale of the problem. For the first time they looked rattled\", industry sources told the BBC.  \nIt's thought the centrepiece of the proposals could include combining the Class C test used for rigid lorries and Class E for larger articulated lorries into a single test. \nCurrently, there is usually a 2-3 week minimum period between taking the two tests.   \nThe haulage industry said a perfect storm of a post-Brexit exodus of drivers, an ageing and retiring workforce and COVID-related delays to testing new drivers had brought some supply chains to breaking point.\nHaulage firms, desperate for drivers to fill lorries left idle and to complete orders left unfulfilled, welcomed the move but warned that it would not be enough to fix the cracks appearing in supply chains.\nThey reiterated their calls for HGV drivers to be added to the Shortage Occupation List which would allow firms to temporarily bring back some of the estimated 20,000 EU drivers who have left the industry. \nPaul Jackson of Chiltern Distribution said: \"This is a sensible move but it's not enough to fix the problem. \n\"We don't put newly qualified drivers straight behind the wheel on their own. We buddy them up with experienced drivers for the first 8-10 weeks and the insurance costs for new drivers are also much higher. \n\"We desperately need to put HGV drivers on the list of skilled workers we can bring in from abroad.\"\nThe Chemical Business Association, which represents chemical firms within the supply chain, reiterated concerns that its members were struggling to get chemicals to water companies.\nTim Doggett, its chief executive, said: \"The supply chain situation in the UK is deteriorating.\" \nA survey conducted by the industry group suggests 96% of member companies are now experiencing issues with UK haulage, up from 63% in its last survey in June.\nThe Chemical Business Association has written to ministers warning about the effects of driver shortages.\nThe group write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June, saying that \"there was a contingent risk to the supply of chemicals into vital areas such as water treatment, which would be critical to the health and wellbeing of the population\".\nThe government is expected to say that the new regime will mean up to 3,000 new drivers can be tested per week. \nCurrently the pass rate is 56% so that would mean an extra 1,600 drivers per week. \nBut Richard Burnett of the Road Haulage Association said the industry was losing 600 drivers a week from the industry and with a net shortfall of 90,000 drivers, it would take nearly two years to fill the gap.  \nThe industry was already reporting shortages of about 60,000 drivers before Brexit and the pandemic. \nEven allowing for that, he said there was no way to plug the recent gaps in time for Christmas - when the UK is more reliant on EU food imports.  \nIn addition, the RHA said the onset of winter weather would throw up obstacles. \"The reality is that an industry already struggling to meet delivery schedules will be brought to its knees at the first outbreak of bad weather conditions.\" \nThe managing director of BJS Distribution Storage and Couriers, Harinder Singh, said the new shorter test was \"not a solution it is a risk\".\n\"Making the test easier does not make better drivers. The solution to the current shortage is to allow temporary visas to drivers from countries that understand the legislation and legal driving parameters of the UK, otherwise this isn't going to solve itself. \n\"By making the test easier you are putting more risk onto the road,\" he added.

      "text": "Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it expects the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year.\nIt said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices.\nHowever, it said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability.\nTransport secretary Grant Shapps said the UK must \"stand on its own two feet\" and not rely on EU drivers.\nSpeaking after Morrisons reported its latest trading figures, Mr Shapps rejected calls for more immigration to resolve the problem. \n\"We have to stand on our own two feet as the United Kingdom. There are a lot of people coming off furlough. I look forward to them getting jobs.\" \nLorry driver shortages have have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.\nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000.\nMr Shapps said: \"To say this is an issue of Brexit is completely untrue. What it is about - is coronavirus.\" \nHe pointed to the global driver shortage in the US, Poland and Germany and said the UK was not alone in having supply chain problems. \nThe transport secretary confirmed that some HGV driver tests would be fast-tracked.\nMorrisons and its rivals have seen gaps on shelves due to the driver shortage.\nLast month, it joined a growing chorus in the food and drink industry calling for government help to recruit lorry drivers.\nChief executive David Potts indicated HGV drivers should be eligible for Skilled Worker visas, allowing them to work in the UK.\nThe firm's latest comments came as it reported first-half results, showing a profit before tax and exceptional items of \u00a3105m in the six months to 1 August, down from \u00a3167m in the same period last year.\nMorrisons is currently at the centre of a takeover battle between two US private equity firms.\nIn its results statement, it reiterated that it had received offers for the company from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) and Fortress and was recommending CD&R's offer of 285p per share.\nShareholders will be asked to approve this offer at a meeting to be held in or around the week beginning 18 October, it added.\nHowever, as neither bidder has said their offer is final, Morrisons said on Wednesday that it was in talks with CD&R, Fortress and the Takeover Panel about an auction to decide its future.\nIt said any auction would take place before the planned shareholder meetings, on a date to be announced by the Takeover Panel.\nMorrisons said the whole British food industry was facing continued challenges from Covid-19 and sustained supply chain cost increases, which were largely outside its control. \nHowever, it added that it was working to address those challenges and that second-half profit was expected to be considerably higher than in the first half. \nWe expect some industry-wide retail price inflation during the second half, driven by sustained recent commodity price increases and freight inflation, and the current shortage of HGV drivers,\" it said.\n\"We will seek to mitigate these and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred to maintain good on-shelf availability.\"\nChairman Andrew Higginson said the whole Morrisons team had shown \"commendable resilience facing into a variety of continuing challenges during the first half, including the ongoing pandemic, disruption at some of our partner suppliers and the impact on our supply chain of HGV driver shortages\".\n\"As we approach our busiest time of year, I'm confident the team will continue to rise to all challenges and keep up all the good work to improve the shopping trip for customers,\" he added.\nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Morrisons, like all supermarkets, had faced the challenge of maintaining customer interest and sales as non-essential retail reopened after the pandemic and life returned to some kind of normality.\n\"But those roadblocks haven't stopped the retailer from shining,\" she added. \"The ongoing bidding war for the UK's fourth-largest grocer has proved that a growing online presence often satisfies the appetite of hungry investors. \n\"Having cemented an important relationship as a key supplier and partner to Amazon, and to McColl's convenience stores, Morrisons has triggered a bidding war among private equity firms in the US, who are more concerned with the lucrative property portfolio which the store network possesses than what's on the shelves.\""

      "tags": "Easyjet,Travel,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "EasyJet has rejected a takeover approach and announced plans to raise \u00a31.2bn from shareholders to help its recovery from the pandemic.\nThe airline said the unsolicited bid undervalued the company and the unnamed suitor was now no longer interested.\nBloomberg reported that the bidder was rival Wizz Air, although it declined to comment.\nEasyJet's boss said the fundraising would allow the firm \"to accelerate our post\u2010Covid\u201019 recovery plan\" instead.\nThe carrier has alreadyraised emergency funds during the crisis, having been affected by Covid-related travel restrictions.\nEasyJet also plans to raise $400m (\u00a3290m) in debt.\nThe company said on Thursday it was \"well-placed to emerge from the pandemic\", but the additional cash would provide a buffer should further coronavirus-related lockdowns delay the airline's recovery.\nIt has lost more than \u00a32bn as many flights were grounded during the coronavirus crisis and it slumped to its first-ever loss in its 25-year history as a result.\nEasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren has spoken out in favour of reducing the costs of Covid tests required for travel, in order to get customers booking again and the aviation industry back on its feet.\nOn Thursday, he said the funds raised through the share sale would strengthen the airline's balance sheet.\nHe added it would also position the firm for growth as the aviation industry in Europe emerges from the pandemic, saying that the airline had seen a spike in customer demand where restrictions have been lifted.\nLooking ahead, the company plans to fly 57% of its 2019 capacity between July and September, \"with a continued focus on profitable flying\".\nIt also said it would try to grow its sales through the launch of new products such as EasyJet Holidays, as well as a \"standard plus\" fare.\nThe airline is in the midst of a huge cost-cutting programme, which it said was set to deliver about \u00a3500m of savings in the financial year to 30 September. \nDespite this, the carrier took the decision to review and reject the takeover approach from an unnamed potential buyer.\nThe board said that the all-share offer \"fundamentally undervalued\" the business and was \"highly conditional\". \nEasyJet shares sank in early trade on the London Stock Exchange on the news,down nearly 8% at 728p.\nHowever, Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"There is some potential upside to consider. \n\"Legacy carriers may pare down some of their routes indefinitely, leaving space for EasyJet to up its presence at major airports. The group couldn't do this without an injection of cash and promised shareholders that at least some of the funds are earmarked for this purpose. \nShe said that although the move was \"risky\", it could pay off if EasyJet was able to expand its presence into more profitable travel routes.\nMr Lundgren said during a call with journalists on Thursday that the firm was in a good position to buy more landing slots as other rival airlines rein in their short-haul operations.\n\"I believe this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity,\" he said.\nAll airline bosses have fretted over one issue since the start of the pandemic - do they have sufficient financial reserves to carry them through to when passengers finally return? \nIt was an almost impossible question to answer, as no-one knew how long the pandemic would last. \nEasyJet thought it had done enough last June, when it boosted its bank lending facilities and in addition asked shareholders to stump up \u00a3450m. Now, like Oliver Twist, the company is asking for more, tapping investors for \u00a31.2bn. \nIt is not only about making good the losses racked up in the past year; it is also, the company says, about positioning it to take advantage of what it believes will be a shake-out of the aviation industry in the coming months. It wants to have sufficient firepower to take advantage of \"a range of long-term strategic and investment opportunities\" that it expects to arise.\nSome may regard EasyJet itself as the investment opportunity. \nThe company also disclosed this morning that it had received an unsolicited takeover approach, which the board had rejected. It is not hard to see why the airline is attracting the attention of suitors - the shares were \u00a318 just three years ago. \nBy making the approach public, the company is sending a coded message to City investors. If you don't want to see another British company fall to an opportunistic bid, it might be a good idea to support our cash call."

      "tags": "Butetown,Cardiff,Crime,South Wales Police,Murder of Lynette White",
      "text": "Members of the so-called \"Cardiff Five\" should be \"recognised as victims\", a senior police officer has said. \nJohn Actie, Ronnie Actie, Stephen Miller, Tony Paris and Yusef Abdullahi spent time in prison after being falsely accused of murdering 20-year-old Lynette White in Cardiff in 1988.\nFormer Chief Constable of South Wales Police Matt Jukes said he was \"sorry for the effect on their lives\". \nHe was speaking on a BBC documentary about the case, A Killing In Tiger Bay. \nIt has been described as as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in UK legal history. \nOne of the three surviving members of the Cardiff Five, John Actie, thanked Mr Jukes for speaking \"brilliantly and truthfully\" and said they were \"the words we wanted to hear years ago\". \nSpeaking as the chief constable of South Wales, before moving to become an Assistant Commissioner in London, Mr Jukes said there was an \"enormous responsibility of transparency\" over the case.  \n\"I joined the police force in the mid-90s, so it was after a series of miscarriages of justice, of which this case was one. \n\"I have to recognise that the Cardiff three and the five originally arrested as victims.  \n\"It's a time for listening but also a time for acting, a time for the whole of the public sector and the whole of wider society to recognise that racism is still very real in our communities. \n\"The disadvantage experienced through the criminal justice system by black communities is real and present and stands to be addressed... and I know will remain a huge focus for South Wales Police. \n\"I'm sorry for the effect the actions that South Wales Police collectively and the criminal justice system had on the Cardiff three, on the five who were arrested,\" he said. \nLynette White was found stabbed more than 50 times in a flat in Cardiff docklands on 14 February 1988. \nDespite detectives stating they were looking for a white suspect, five black and mixed-race men were later arrested and charged with her murder. \nAfter 19 interviews by officers, a false confession was obtained from Stephen Miller, Ms White's boyfriend. \nThe first trial of the five men stopped after the judge in the case died during proceedings. \nAfter two years in custody, John and Ronnie Actie were cleared by a jury at a second trial. \nBut Stephen Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris were found guilty, sentenced to life, and became known as the Cardiff Three. \nAfter a huge campaign, in 1992 the Court of Appeal ruled a gross miscarriage of justice had taken place. \nJudge Lord Justice Taylor said that short of physical abuse, it was \"hard to conceive of a more hostile and intimidatory approach by police officers, during the interview of Stephen Miller\". \nUnder interrogation Stephen Miller admitted to the killing and named others as being responsible.\n\"Why did I accuse innocent men? That's something I have to take to my grave with me,\" Mr Miller told the documentary. \n\"I'm a 22-year-old sitting in a police station, and they put me in this room and they just started flinging things at me - allegation after allegation - I mean it was so intense.\n\"I was a sorry soul - I think if they'd said God was in there with me, I'd have said yes. \n\"I felt like a prisoner of war. They just took me off the streets, and told me I done this.\"\nThe real murderer, Jeffrey Gafoor, was jailed in 2003 thanks to DNA evidence.\nIn 2011 police officers involved in the original, flawed investigation were put on trial for alleged corruption. They denied the charges. \nThe \u00a330m case collapsed due to missing paperwork which was said to have been shredded, although it was found just weeks after the trial ended.  \nA Home Office review said the investigation represented \"one of the worst miscarriages of justice in the history of our criminal justice system\". \nRonnie Actie was found dead in 2007 and friends said he struggled to cope after time in prison. Yusef Abdullahi died in 2011. \nTony Paris lost his father just weeks before he was freed by the appeal court in 1992. \nHe told the programme: \"That's what killed my old man, they took his boy away, said he did something he didn't do, and we know it.\"\nMr Paris said he too was pleased that a senior police officer was now describing him and the four others as victims. \n\"It's important, 30 years down the line, because although we've had apologies before, now the whole world can see we are innocent and we are victims,\" he said. \nThe police officers involved in the original investigation declined to take part in the programme. \nMr Jukes said the \"question of accountability\" in this case lay with \"the organisation and its senior leadership\". \n\"It is of course important to say that there were lots of other people tragically affected by this case - individuals who were involved in the investigation, individuals who were witnesses. \n\"The organisation, its professionalism, its candour is different now than it was. \n\"I think every age has its own challenges, and our expectations now about the way we conduct ourselves and our investigations are not only so very different but they're also exposed to so much more scrutiny. \n\"It's a real cause of sadness that Lynette's name gets used as shorthand for this case and it's easy to forget that a young woman's life was lost.\"\nResponding to Mr Jukes' comments, John Actie said: \"I really appreciate that Matt Jukes has said these things... I'd like to say thank you very much.\"\nMr Actie said that he hoped the documentary would show people in the UK and across the world \"exactly what went down\" and highlight the wide-ranging, long-term effects on those involved. \n\"This is something where we can go 'look - sit up and watch it' and you judge yourself. \n\"The truth is important - the truth will set your free - and freedom is priceless. You can't buy your freedom.\"  \nA Killing In Tiger Bay starts on  9 September at 21:00 BST on BBC One Wales, on BBC Two in the rest of UK and on BBC iPlayer"

      "text": "MPs have voted 319 to 248 for a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance for workers and employers to help fund health and social care.\nBoris Johnson hopes the tax increase, which breaks a Conservative manifesto pledge, will raise \u00a312bn a year.\nThe prime minister said his plan would deal with \"catastrophic costs\" faced by those who need care.\nBut Labour raised concerns that people could still have to sell their home in order to pay for the help they need. \nDuring a House of Commons debate, some Conservative MPs also raised objections to the proposals.\nFormer minister Steve Baker called on his party to \"rediscover what it stands for\" rather than \"every time there is a squeeze on the public finances, coming back for higher taxes\".\nOpposition MPs voted against the rise but the government, which has a majority of more than 80, comfortably won the vote.\nFive Conservatives - Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Davies, Neil Hudson, Esther McVey and John Redwood - voted against the changes.\nThirty-seven Conservative MPs abstained. However, while some abstained due to concerns about the tax rise, others may simply been given permission to miss the vote. \nPoliticians have long agreed on the need to reform England's social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication.\nThe key proposals of the new plan are: \nCurrently workers pay 12% National Insurance on earnings between \u00a39,564 and \u00a350,268. However, anything earned above this amount attracts a rate of just 2%.\nMr Johnson has said the majority of the \u00a336bn fund raised by the tax rise will go towards catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid.\nA smaller portion of the money - \u00a35.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nThe UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional \u00a32.2bn to spend on their services. \nFrom 2023, the increase in National Insurance will become a separate levy, while the National Insurance rates will return to their previous level.\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said that under Mr Johnson's plan \"someone with a house worth \u00a3186,000 would still have to pay \u00a386,000 even with this cap - and that's before living costs of going into a care home.\"\n\"How does the chancellor suggest they pay those fees without selling their home?\" she asked.\nAlong with Labour, the SNP also voted against the government's proposals, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford accusing the Conservatives of \"taxing Scottish workers twice\" and \"forcing them to pay the bill for social care in England as well as at home in Scotland\".\nAnd Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister had failed to come up with a plan to tackle care staff vacancies or help unpaid family carers.\nConservative MP Jake Berry was among the critical voices from the government's own backbench, warning ministers that \"throwing other people's money down a bottomless pit doesn't become a good idea if you put the NHS logo next to it\".\nMr Johnson sought to reassure his own MPs ahead of the vote, telling a meeting of backbenchers: \"We should never forget we are the party of low taxation.\"\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

Energia is the lead developer of Russia's ISS modules. \nHe also said small cracks had been discovered on Russia's Zarya cargo section and they could worsen over time.\nThe ISS was built in 1998 as part of a joint project between Russia, the US, Canada, Japan and several European countries and was originally designed for a 15-year lifespan. \nIn April, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov told state TV that aging metal on the station could \"lead to irreversible consequences - to catastrophe. We mustn't let that happen\".\nRoscosmos said last year that structural fatigue meant the ISS would not be capable of operating beyond 2030. \nIn July, a malfunction caused the jet thrusters on the Nauka module to fire without warning, destabilising the ISS.\nRussia said in April that it could leave the ISS and build its own space station by 2030, though nothing has been finalised. \nThere are currently seven astronauts on board the ISS: two from Russia, three from the US, one from France and one from Japan. \nYou might also be interested in:"

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,English Channel,Tobias Ellwood,Europe migrant crisis,Reality Check",
      "text": "More than 14,000 migrants have made it across the English Channel this year, crossing from France to the UK. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel wants to allow the UK Border Force to be able to turn back boats carrying migrants across the English Channel in certain circumstances.\nIt's assumed a \"pushback\" tactic would see UK Border Force forcing migrant vessels to turn around in the Channel. It would then be left to the French coastguard to intercept the migrant boats in their territorial waters.\nUK authorities would not be allowed in France's territorial waters without consent and that could cause problems, says Prof Andrew Serdy, a law of the sea expert.\n\"If France doesn't want to take them back once they have left, it cannot be forced to do so and a stand-off ensues.\"\nAs well as a potential lack of co-operation with France, it's also unclear whether the UK's tactic would be legal under international law.\nAccording to the UN Convention of the Law at Sea countries are required to \"render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost\".\nAnd the practice of turning boats around came under criticism in June from Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez Morales - the UN's special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants:\n\"Pushback measures and practices demonstrate a denial of states' international obligations to protect the human rights of migrants at international borders and tarnish a state's image,\" he said.\nIn a report published in May, the UN Human Rights Council said that pushbacks were incompatible with international human rights law unless an \"individualised assessment for each migrant concerned and other procedural safeguards\" were in place.\nThat means, under international law, the UK would need to determine the risks faced by every individual migrant on a boat before forcing it out of waters, says James Turner, a barrister specialising in shipping disputes:\n\"There is a fundamental principle of the international law of asylum that you cannot land individuals at a place they might face persecution.\"\nFor example, in 2012 the European Court of Human Rights found Italy had broken the law when Italian authorities picked up Somali and Eritrean migrants at sea and sent them back to Libya. The court noted that the situations of migrants had not been examined individually. \nMr Turner also says the UK could also fall foul of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea because there would be \"attempts to push back in some of the most dangerous and congested waters\".\nHowever, the UK government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be.\nA country's territorial waters stretch for 12 miles off its coast. Beyond that is international waters.\nThat means that the most popular route between Calais and Dover (because it is the shortest) is entirely in French or British territorial water.\nIf a boat carrying people is found within national waters it is generally the case that that country has a duty to rescue them to a place of safety.\nIn international waters, it's slightly less clear and may vary on a case by case basis. But there is still a legal obligation to rescue those in distress and take them to a place of safety.\nFurther down the Channel, where it widens out, the waters outside of the two countries' territories are divided up into French and English search-and-rescue zones. \nThese rescue zones - which roughly divide the area of the Channel in half between the two countries - are co-ordinated by operations centres in Dover in the UK and Gris Nez (between Calais and Boulogne) in northern France.\nIt's the responsibility of the authorities there to ensure that anyone in distress in these zones receives assistance. In reality, if people are in danger, any boat nearby will have a duty to rescue them. \nThose picked up in the UK zone will be taken to an English port and those in the French zone to a port in France.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive. There's nothing to say you must seek asylum in the first safe country.\nHowever, under EU law there is a provision to allow asylum applications to be transferred to another member state.\nThe Dublin Regulation states that a person's asylum claim can be transferred to the first member state they entered.\nIn 2020, according to Home Office statistics, 882 people were transferred to the UK from another EU country under the Dublin rules, and 105 were transferred (from 8,502 requests) out of the UK.\nSince the end of 2020, the UK has no longer been subject to the Dublin regulation because it is no longer part of the EU.\nThe UK grants refugee status to those who are unable to live in their own country for fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or other factors such as sexual orientation. A successful application usually allows someone leave to remain for five years with the opportunity after that to apply for indefinite leave to remain.\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.\nUPDATE - This article was first was published on 4 January 2019.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter"

      "text": "PayPal is introducing new fees for payments between businesses in the UK and those in Europe, from November.\nBritish businesses will be charged a 1.29% fee for payments from the European Economic Area and vice versa. \nMost currently pay about 0.5% in similar charges, which have remained unchanged since before the UK left the EU customs union and single market. \nPayPal said it was now incurring extra costs, such as the rise in interchange fees between the UK and EEA. \nEuropean rules capping credit and debit card interchange fees at 0.2% and 0.3% no longer apply to UK businesses. \nAnd both Visa and Mastercard have announced they will raise them fivefold from mid-October. \nThe EEA is made up of the 27 remaining European Union states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\nAnd the new charges apply to the whole of the UK, Guernsey, Jersey, Gibraltar, and the Isle of Man. \nMost businesses will see their current 0.5% fee raised to 1.29% - still lower than PayPal's standard 1.99% for the rest of the world - but some of those with their own customised agreements with PayPal will have their existing rate raised by 1.29%.\nThe new fee was first mentioned on the same day the company announced it would accept cryptocurrency Bitcoin but details were not released until this week.\nPayPal said it was \"simplifying\" its cross-border fees. \n\"In a highly competitive market, this will make it easier for these businesses to compare PayPal's pricing with that of other providers and to better appreciate the value we provide,\" it said.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said any rise in payment-platform fees \"is unwelcome news for small businesses and entrepreneurs\".\n\"Since the start of the year, around one in four small exporters have stopped exporting to the EU, citing amongst other reasons the costs involved in selling to EU-based customers,\" vice-chairman Martin McTague said.\n And over the past three months, a little over 40% of small exporters said the value of their exports had dropped.\n\"We need to see stronger support for small exporters from the government, including a relaunched SME [Small and Medium Enterprises]Brexit Support Fund and a reformed Tradeshow Access Programme,\" McTague added."

      "title": "NI Protocol: DUP could quit from Stormont 'within weeks'",
      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Brexit,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "The Democratic Unionist Party may quit Stormont \"within weeks\" if its demands over the Northern Ireland Protocol are not met, its leader has suggested.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson also said he feared a return to the loyalist street violence seen earlier in the year unless the issue was resolved.\nHe said his party would also now boycott most north-south ministerial meetings.\nHe said relations could not be \"business as usual\".\nMost Stormont parties criticised the speech while the EU's Brexit negotiator called for calm.\nDuring his speech in Belfast, Sir Jeffrey said it would be clear \"within weeks\" if there was a basis for the assembly and executive to continue, or if an election was needed. \n\"I say not as a threat, but as a matter of political reality, that our political institutions will not survive a failure to resolve the problems that the protocol has created,\" Sir Jeffrey said.\n\"Neither will they survive an indefinite 'stand still' period; urgent action is needed.\"\nHe also said DUP ministers would resign from their posts rather than implement further border checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\n\"If in the final analysis those who are democratically elected by the people of Northern Ireland lack the power to prevent such checks, and the protocol issues remain, then the position in office of DUP Ministers would become untenable,\" Sir Jeffrey added. \nThe protocol is part of the UK government's Brexit deal with the European Union.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods to ensure free trade across the Irish border.\nHowever, it has led to additional checks on goods being traded across the Irish Sea, which has drawn criticism and protests from unionists.\nNot all the checks have been implemented due to what are known as grace periods.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson laid it out pretty clearly today.\nHis message for the government was blunt -  you can either have the political institutions or the protocol - you can't have both.\nIn terms of the mechanics of how you bring down government in Northern Ireland, essentially what has to happen is that the first minister or deputy first minister needs to resign.\nThere then is a period of seven days, and if the positions are not filled within that period, it's over to the secretary of state who has to set a date within a reasonable period of time for an election.\nHowever, we know from James Brokenshire's time as secretary of state, that a reasonable period can last for months and months on end.\nThere's no guarantee that if the DUP walk away from government that we will end up in an election within a matter of weeks.\nThe smart money would suggest that Brandon Lewis may well take the view that there is no point in calling an election when we have one already scheduled for next May.\nEarlier this week the UK government indefinitely extended the grace periods which it said was necessary to create space for further talks with the EU.\nSir Jeffrey's speech came as the European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic began a two-day visit to Northern Ireland for talks with business and political leaders. \nSir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, said he believed in devolution and wanted to return to the assembly as an assembly member (MLA).\nHe said he wanted to provide a \"window of opportunity\" to find a solution and expressed concern there could be a return to disorder on Northern Ireland's streets \"unless we grapple with this issue\".\nThe DUP leader outlined four steps his party would take, including an end to its engagement with north-south bodies, except for co-operation on health matters. \nThe north-south arrangements, provisioned for by the Good Friday Agreement, feature six all-Ireland bodies, with responsibility for matters such as waterways and food standards, which operate under the policy direction of the North-South Ministerial Council. \nIt is comprised of ministers from both sides of the border. \nMinisters from Northern Ireland are required to attend under the Ministerial Code of office. \nThe DUP attended the last meeting of the council in July.\nSir Jeffrey said this was done \"as an act of good faith\" but issues remain unresolved. \n\"Therefore, as the protocol issues remain unresolved, the DUP will immediately withdraw from the structures of Strand Two of the Belfast Agreement relating to north south arrangements, while we will ensure important health related matters continue to be addressed on a cooperative basis,\" he said. \nSir Jeffrey also outlined that DUP ministers would \"seek to block additional checks at the ports\" and would examine the legality of the current checks and \"whether they should have required executive approval\".\nThe DUP leader also explained his executive team would \"seek to frustrate and prevent\" alignment between NI Assembly legislation and laws passed by the EU.\n\"Let me be clear if the choice is ultimately between remaining in office or implementing the protocol in its present form, then the only option for any unionist minister would be to cease to hold such office,\" he said.\n\"Time is short and consequences will follow.\n\"The prize of a successful outcome is not just for unionism, but for all of Northern Ireland and it is not just for the UK, but for the EU as well.\"\nSir Jeffery said he feared a return to street violence in loyalist areas witnessed in April. \n\"Since the start of July, the streets have been quieter in terms of violence, but I fear that unless we grapple with this issue, this will prove to be merely a pause, rather than an end to the disorder,\" he said. \nHe echoed this view in an interview later with the BBC's Political Thinking podcast with Nick Robinson. \n\"If politics fails ... then I fear there will be others who may decide to step into the gap,\" he said. \nHe went on to say that he and other community leaders had \"been saying to the boys on the streets please don't be on the streets\" and that as a result, Northern Ireland had been peaceful \"all summer\".\nA DUP withdrawal from its executive roles, including first minister, would not automatically trigger an assembly election, however, it would begin the process.\nGiven the joint nature of the office, First Minister Paul Givan's departure would also remove Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill as Deputy First Minister.\nThis would then start a seven-day process for the parties to agree to fresh nominations..\nIf this did not happen, NI Secretary Brandon Lewis would be responsible for calling an election within a \"reasonable\" timeframe.\nTaoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said the speech had \"created new challenges\". \nSinn F\u00e9in President Mary-Lou McDonald said it was a \"reckless, irresponsible and short-sighted election stunt\".\nShe said the DUP was \"clearly in panic mode, driven by poor opinion polls\" and are \"focused on their own narrow self-interest\".\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was \"naive in the extreme\" and that the DUP leader had \"offered no solutions\".\n\"I think it is very dangerous when people are languishing on waiting lists and we're dealing with a global pandemic, we have people playing indulgent games that are more about polls than protocols,\" he told BBC NI's The Nolan Show.\nAlliance Party leader and Stormont Justice Minister Naomi Long said there was a need for \"pragmatic solutions\" to protocol matters rather than for \"people to escalate this into a constitutional crisis\".\nMrs Long described Sir Jeffrey's address as \"cynical party posturing to try and recover perceived electoral losses because of polling\".\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said his party shared the DUP's concerns about the protocol, but that it would be a \"bad idea\" to collapse Stormont.\n\"The problem is we do need to have some sort of a treaty which deals with the issues between the United Kingdom and the European Union,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, the UUP published a paper detailing its recommendations \"for a common-sense solution to the problems created by the protocol\".\nIt included provisions for a new criminal offence \"to knowingly export goods designed for the UK internal market into the EU single market\".\nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said Sir Jeffrey's speech included \"some fine words\", but \"it is actions that count\".\nSimon Coveney, the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, said unionist concerns about the protocol had been \"taken seriously\", but \"no positive agenda is served by blocking practical north-south co-operation or by the breakdown of the other institutions of the Good Friday Agreement\".\n\"The EU is already listening closely to concerns in Northern Ireland and is ready to work in good faith to minimise friction,\" he continued."

      "text": "More than \u00a37m has been paid out in compensation by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to 1,600 men who were abused at a detention centre.\nMedomsley in County Durham housed teenage offenders who had committed minor crimes.\nIt closed in 1988 and 25 years later Durham Police began an investigation into abuse by former staff.\nThe MoJ said the cut-off for claims was 1 January 2022 with \u00a37.2m paid out so far to 1,651 people.\nAn MoJ spokesman said: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with those who suffered abuse at Medomsley. \nHundreds of men came forward and reported physical abuse at the centre from the 1960s to 1980s. \nBarry Coles, from Hartlepool, was 17 years old when he was sent to Medomsley for riding a motorbike without tax and insurance.\nHe suffered regular beatings and said he witnessed some appalling sights.\nMr Coles said: \"I saw a lot of kids trying to escape and some got stuck in the barbed wire and they were pulling them out, they didn't give you the lickings of a dog.\"\nIn 2019\u00a0five former prison officers were convicted for their part in the physical abuse of inmates at Medomsley.\nMr Coles added life at the centre was \"brutal\" and described how officers would \"whack you across the back\" with sticks they carried.\n\"They used to come over and kick the bucket and give you a good kicking for getting the floor wet,\" he said.\nLast year the MoJ set up a compensation scheme for people who had been physically abused by any of the staff at the detention centre.\nIt said it had so far paid out \u00a37.2m - the maximum individual award was \u00a35,000.\nSolicitors said the amount of money awarded depended on the length of time the men had spent at Medomsley and the extent of their injuries.\nSolicitor Nathalie Clayton, from Tilly Bailey and Irvine, the firm representing the men, said: \"The scheme has enabled us to deal with claims more quickly and I think it's given people a platform to eventually be able to speak about what happened to them and move forward knowing they've received some justice for what happened.\"\nThe scheme will end to new claims on 1 January.\nThe MoJ said since the closure of Medomsley there were regular Ofsted inspections of young offender centres, the Youth Justice Board had been created and there was improved CCTV and other technology to help protect young offenders.\nIt said staff working at such sites now received specialist training and added robust child protection procedures were in place.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,UK immigration,France,English Channel,People smuggling,Europe migrant crisis,Calais",
      "text": "Efforts are under way to identify 27 people who drowned crossing the English Channel. \nTheir deaths have raised questions about why so many people are attempting the journey despite the dangerous conditions.\nFor years, people smugglers have sent people to the UK in lorries. There have also been tragedies on these routes, including the 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in 2019.\nBut security at the Port of Calais in France - where UK border controls are - has been tightened.\nThis means more attempts are being made to send people by boat, according to Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force.\nHe says Covid has also had a role, as fewer lorries have been travelling to the UK: \"Human smugglers have changed their tactics and they've now taken to this relatively new phenomenon of putting people into small boats and bringing them across in that way.\"\nIn the few studies that exist, family ties have been identified as the main reason migrants wish to travel from France to the UK.\nIn a survey of 402 people at the former Calais \"Jungle\" camp, researchers from the International Health journal found only 12% wanted to remain in France, while 82% planned to go to England. \nOf those that wanted to travel to England more than half (52%), said they already had a family member there.\n\"They have a connection to the UK, they speak some English, they have family, they have friends and people in their networks. They want to come and stay and rebuild their lives,\" says Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council.\nIt has been suggested the UK's jobs market often attracts migrants - a claim supported by the French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. There aren't reliable surveys to support this though. \nMarley Morris, an immigration expert at the IPPR think tank says the UK has introduced policies that make it much harder to work illegally.\n\"These arguments were put forward 20 years ago, when people said the UK system was too generous. The UK responded by tightening up the rules. \n\"While we don't have ID cards, the policies introduced make it much harder to work illegally, [and] employers are fined for employing someone for not having the right to work.\" \nAs well as language and family ties, some Calais-based migrants told the BBC they wanted to come to the UK due to historic links with their own country. \nSome also expressed unhappiness at the way they are being treated in France, which can lead to more people attempting to make the crossing according to Rob McNeil, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University.\n\"Imagine you are being poorly treated in the country you are in. Your presumption is that the immediate environment is unpleasant and you want to get away from that\", he says.\nIt's unlikely that migrants choose to come to the UK because they feel they have less chance of being sent back compared to other European countries adds Mr McNeil.\n\"One thing we know is that the data suggests that people travelling to any country have very little knowledge of the laws and practices of enforcing immigration,\" he says.  \nDespite the dangers, some say they have already taken significant risks to get as far as Calais and are willing to take further ones to get to the UK. For example, the International Health journal study also found that two-thirds of people had experienced at least one act of violence during their journey or in Calais.\nMany migrants already choose to make an asylum claim in the first country they arrive in - such as Greece, Turkey or Italy - and only a minority choose to travel on to the UK.\nLast year, Germany had the highest number of asylum applicants in the EU (122,015 applicants), while France had 93,475 applicants.\nIn the same period the UK received the 5th largest number of applicants (36,041) when compared with countries in the EU (around 7% of the total). This represents the 17th largest intake when measured per head of population, according to UN Refugee Agency."

      "tags": "Companies,Social mobility,KPMG",
      "text": "Accounting giant KPMG has become one of the first large UK businesses to set a target for the number of employees from working class backgrounds. \nKPMG has defined working class as having parents with \"routine and manual\" jobs, such as drivers, cleaners and farm workers. \nIt wants 29% of its partners and directors to come from working class backgrounds by 2030. \nThat compares with 23% of partners and 20% of directors at the moment. \nKMPG said that these employees were paid 8.6% less than those from the other socio-economic groups.   \nIn February, KMPG faced a backlash after its former chairman dismissed the notion of \"unconscious bias\" training. \nEarlier this month the firm was accused by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC)  of giving it \"false and misleading\" information about collapsed construction giant Carillion. In July, KPMG was also criticised by the UK accounting regulator for  its \"unacceptable\" bank audits for the third year in a row. \nAccording to data from the Social Mobility Commission, 39% of the UK workforce aged 16 plus are working class.\nThe Labour Force survey also showed that 24% were \"intermediate\", defined as having parents with jobs such as secretaries, call centre agents and nursery nurses. The remaining 37% had \"professional backgrounds\" with parents working as teachers, finance managers, software designers and accountants. \nKPMG said that while its senior and junior colleagues were its most socio-economically diverse employees, working class representation in middle management grades was comparatively lower and this was contributing to the pay gaps. \nThe firm's diversity data is from a non-mandatory survey in which 70% of staff took part. Out of the 10,444 staff who were surveyed, 1,289 selected \"I don't know\" or \"Prefer not to say\" options when asked about their backgrounds. \nThe company will also train its 16,000 employees to understand the issue of socio-economic background and to recognise \"invisible barriers\" to progression. \nKPMG chair Bina Mehta said she was from a working-class background and was a \"passionate believer that greater diversity improves business performance\".\n\"Diversity brings fresh thinking and different perspectives to decision-making, which in turn delivers better outcomes for our clients,\" she added. \nMs Mehta was appointed to the role this year after the resignation of the company's former chairman, Bill Michael. During a company-wide Zoom call, he said there was \"no such thing as unconscious bias\". \nIn anonymous comments on the Zoom call workers complained and one wrote: \"There's no such thing as unconscious bias?! Are you joking? Please do your research before just making such statements. Check your privilege.\"\nAlong with the other \"big four\" accountancy firms PwC, Deloitte and EY, KPMG offers unconscious bias training for its staff. It is designed to increase awareness about race, sex, sexuality or disability prejudices and patterns of discrimination in the workplace. \nNick Miller, chief executive of non-profit consultancy the Bridge Group, said: \"In publishing pay gaps by socio-economic background for the first time, and using this to inform a strategy for change, KPMG is leading the way.\" \nOn the verifiability of socio-economic staff surveys, Sarah Atkinson, chief executive of the Social Mobility Foundation, told the BBC: \"We don't see this being any different to the risk of employees lying about work experience on their CV; if businesses implement social mobility into all their practices it will create fairness of opportunity.\n\"Social mobility in business is about rewarding potential, not polish.\n\"It demands a whole business approach: recruiting directly from areas where there are fewest opportunities, providing non-degree pathways and creating workplace cultures that are inclusive for all,\" she added. \nTessy Ojo, chief executive of the Diana Award's employability programme, agreed that there were risks the socio-economic data may not be \"properly measured\" by the surveys and said if they are \"not mandatory how will we know that they (KPMG) are hitting the target?\"\n\"They need to make sure people don't face barriers at the grass root level and ensure staff monitoring is anonymous so people can take part.\"\nAnalysts project that social mobility will worsen as a result of the pandemic and 600,000 more children are now living in relative poverty, compared with 2012. \nHalf of adults from the poorest backgrounds receive no training at all after leaving school and even in a professional role, they earn 17% less, on average, than more privileged colleagues, according to a 2020 report by the Social Mobility Commission. \nThe commission found people who come from a privileged rather than a working-class background are 60% more likely to be in a professional job. \nThe same report found that where a person comes from is also decisive in what professional opportunities they have. Young people are twice as likely to go to university if they are from a social mobility \"hot spot\" such as some city centres or high performing school areas (27%), compared with those from remote rural or former industrial areas (14%) across the UK. \nHowever, more people from working class families are now in professional jobs, with the percentage having increased to 39% in 2020 compared with 33% in 2014. \nThe UK ranks 21st on a global social mobility index, well behind most European countries. It has a high score on access to education, but Dame Martina Milburn, chief executive of the Prince's Trust charity group, said the UK \"does poorly on labour market policies to help the unemployed and on fair wages\". \nHowever, employees are divided about whether they would want similar targets in their workplaces. \nThomas from Leeds told the BBC that even as someone who would benefit, he thought it was a bad idea. \n\"As soon as you set targets like this you are moving towards positive discrimination, which let's face it is just discrimination.\"\n\"The mantra should always be to hire people based on their ability to do the job which will include an element of fitting into the workplace culture. Social mobility should happen naturally. I am proof of that.\"\nJack, an IT manager from Birmingham, said though it was a \"step in the right direction\", he was \"generally suspicious\" of quotas. \nHe left school at 16 and is now in a management position aged 28.  He said the reason he progressed was because people assumed he had a degree. \nHe said that as they \"did not bother to clarify\", he \"didn't bother correcting them either\".\n\"What this does acknowledge is that the main source of inequality in the workplace is class and nothing else - this fits with my views as a working class person.\"\nWould you describe yourself as working-class?

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nCompulsory vaccinations for care home workers in England, unless they are exempt, will be brought in later this year and now a consultation is being launched about whether this should apply to other health professionals. So far 88% of NHS trust staff, the government says, have received two doses of the Covid vaccine. And depending on the outcome of the six-week consultation it could mean jabs become mandatory for frontline NHS and care workers in England. Staff in contact with those receiving care would also have to have the flu vaccine. Exemptions apply.\nMSPs will be voting on plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme later which, the Scottish government says, will allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. It means fully jabbed people will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events, concerts and festivals. However, there's concern among some business and opposition parties.\nA makeshift hospital treating Covid patients in North Macedonia has gone up in flames, killing at least 14 people. Footage shared on social media showed a building on fire with thick smoke billowing into the air on Wednesday. Firefighters put out the blaze within the hour. Health Minister Venko Filipce says \"this is a very sad day,\" and warns the number of casualties could rise.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson believes new funds - raised by increasing National Insurance which was voted in by MPs on Wednesday - will tackle the backlog created by coronavirus. But the pandemic continues to cast a long shadow over the NHS because of uncertainty over how case numbers and hospital admissions will develop next year. Health editor Hugh Pym takes a look at whether the plan will work.\nFashion is returning to the runway this week with New York Fashion Week. And for the first time since the start of the pandemic, it'll be a largely in-person event. Supermodels, like many of us, were stuck at home so how did they keep working when flights were grounded, large gatherings were stopped and fashion shoots were cancelled?

      "text": "Attitudes to calling 999 have changed significantly over the years, the number's longest-serving operator has said.\nMary Davies, 74, from Anglesey, joined the service 54 years ago and said some people call when they need \"a lift home\" or for a toothache.\nBT said calls to 999 operators have been among the highest in its 84-year history.\nThey peaked this summer, when 135,668 calls were made in one day.\nMs Davies became a 999 call assistant back in 1967 when she was just 19, and estimates she has answered millions of calls.\nShe said she had seen the scale of calls change over the years, from switchboard to \"a push of a button\".\nIn the 1960s, there were about 15 members of staff answering local calls, all of whom had to sign the Official Secrets Act because they could be answering a call to a friend or neighbour.\nMs Davies said the biggest change had been technology, and being able to trace calls easily means a lot of people can get the help quicker \"even up a mountain or in the middle of the sea\".\nShe said: \"Say if someone called from a payphone and they put the phone down then we wouldn't have had their number.\n\"We would have to get in touch with the engineer and they would try and find it. All calls would be found but not like it is today, it could have taken an hour before.\n\"Back then if they were calling for an ambulance they were genuinely ill, and these days they seem to call if they have a toothache.\n\"They take advantage of it. Nowadays they seem to call the police and they tell us they need to get home, but is that not a taxi service?\"\nMs Davies said although she gets these calls and pranks, she takes all calls seriously.\n\"It makes me annoyed as there could be quite a lot of people out there who desperately need the police or an ambulance for whatever has happened and they're wasting their time really,\" she said.\nWhile Ms Davies started with calls just in her area, over the years it has all changed and she has worked through some major events across the world.\nShe answered calls after the Manchester Arena bombing, the 7/7 bombings in London and even the 9/11 attacks, where she spoke to friends and family who were desperate for information.\nShe said although it was difficult, \"you need to be ready for the next call\".\n\"With the Manchester Arena, you realise you're in the centre and there is something going on and something has happened,\" she said.\n\"We tend to discuss it on our breaks and then you go home, you try to put it in the back of your mind because you can't dwell on anything.\n\"You are sad and shocked but the kind of work you do, you just have to carry on and take the next call because you don't know who is the queue for the next call.\n\"As far as I am concerned I treat everyone the same. Everything is an emergency.\n\"The job is to help as many people as I can whatever their needs are.\"\nMs Davies, who is a grandmother, was awarded an MBE this year for her service to a job she said she got into, \"because I just love to talk\".\nShe moved over to a less urgent line during the coronavirus lockdowns and said she \"was just glad to help so many people\".\n\"All we had were people asking for chemists, doctors, hospitals and crematoriums.\n\"I was very surprised lots of them didn't know their doctor's surgery, they could just tell us their town or village.\"\nIn the last year, BT handled about 33 million 999 calls but in 2000, that figure was 25 million calls.\nMs Davies said police requests were down but ambulance calls significantly higher.\nAnd this summer, 999 call handlers answered on average more than 100,000 calls a day. \nMs Davies said: \"It was hard going at that time but I was so glad to be able to help so many people.\n\"I've been very fortunate as I came here in 1967 and I learned a lot of new skills and I travelled to lots of different places.\n\"I love helping people and talking. It is a big achievement at the end of a shift, knowing what you've done.\""

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "Victims of police injustice are calling for the prime minister to replace Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick when her contract comes to an end in April.\nIn an open letter, they accuse her of \"presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up\".\nThe BBC understands Dame Cressida, 60, has been offered a two-year extension and that negotiations are ongoing.\nSince her appointment in 2017, she has been involved in several controversies.\nTwo of the seven who signed the letter, published in the Daily Mail, are Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephen was murdered in a racist attack, and Lady Brittan, whose home was raided when her husband Lord Brittan was falsely accused of child abuse.\nThe others include Alastair Morgan, whose brother Daniel was murdered in 1987 - the killer remains unidentified and a report into the case accused the force of institutional corruption and sparked denials from the Met's leadership - and the son of D-Day Army officer Lord Bramall, who was falsely accused of child sexual abuse by the paedophile and fantasist Carl Beech.\nBBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, and the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor - another victim of Beech's false allegations - are also signatories, as is Sir Edward Heath's biographer Michael McManus. The former prime minister was another public figure smeared by Beech.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Mr Proctor said it was \"utterly extraordinary\" the government should contemplate extending Dame Cressida's tenure \"even for a day, let alone two years\".\nHe said the letter's signatories were linked by their common experiences of police malpractice over a number of years, and they had come up with no reason why the chief commissioner \"who has failed and failed and failed\" should be given an extension.\n\"There must be other chief commissioners outside of London who'd be prepared to do the job and do it a great deal better, with integrity and without cover-up after cover-up.\n\"I personally believe she should have resigned months ago. I'm not fighting for myself, I'm fighting for the future so that it won't happen to anyone else.\n\"And it could happen to someone else if changes are not made at the top of the Metropolitan Police. No-one has been held responsible for the problems Operation Midland [the Carl Beech allegations investigation] created.\n\"The commissioner even got a damehood - quite outrageous.\"\nMr Proctor said he received an apology in person from Lord Hogan-Howe, Dame Cressida's predecessor, who was the Met's chief commissioner while Beech's allegations were treated as \"credible and true\", but he rejected an apology from Dame Cressida because \"her words and actions did not go hand in hand\". \n\"I call on the prime minister and the home secretary to meet with all seven of us to hear our experiences - and I would defy them then to continue with any extension of her remit.\"\nMr Gambaccini, who sued the Met over the way it dealt with accusations against him, said Dame Cressida postponed the case for as long as possible in what he described as \"three and a half years of non-honesty\".\nSpeaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, he also said that he and his fellow signatories \"all found that the leadership of the Metropolitan Police is breathtakingly corrupt\".\nHe accused both the chief commissioner and the force of misleading the public.\nAs the first female Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick was bound to be well received when she was appointed in 2017. It was the job she had always wanted and it meant a return to the force where she had spent most of her career and where she was popular with the rank and file. \nSome of the criticism now being levelled at her relates to her time at Scotland Yard before she was in the top job.\nIn 2014 as an assistant commissioner she was in charge of the team involved in Operation Midland - the disastrous long-running inquiry into an alleged VIP paedophile ring. When Midland collapsed and the complainant, Carl Beech, was exposed as a serial liar, criticism was levelled at a number of officers including one detective who had initially described Beech's story as \"credible and true\". \nCressida Dick admitted that she had heard the officer say this on the radio and had done nothing to correct it.\nThe former MP Harvey Proctor, who lost his job and his home as a result of being falsely accused by Carl Beech, is one of the seven signatories to the letter saying that Dame Cressida must not have her contract extended. He, like the others, does not believe that over the past four years she has displayed the right characteristics to remain in the role.\nDoreen, now Baroness, Lawrence is the first name on the letter. She says she is unhappy that the commissioner has closed her son's murder inquiry and, as a lifelong race campaigner, she is also concerned about the Met's use of stop and search. \nThe signatories were brought together by the Daily Mail, which has been calling for Cressida Dick to go.\nThe commissioner recently described herself as an honourable person. The question now is whether she will want to accept a two-year extension.\nMr Gambaccini also criticised the BBC for its reporting of his case, accusing it of being on the \"side of wrongdoers\". \nHe has previously described the corporation as \"the worst employer in the world\", alleging that no senior managers were in touch with him during his time under investigation by the Met Police. The BBC said it had no comment to make.\nIn February 2017, Dame Cressida became the first woman to lead London's force since its inception in 1829. Her appointment was criticised at the time by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly shot dead during an operation she led in 2005.\nNow Dame Cressida is coming to the end of a five-year contract, Home Secretary Priti Patel has consulted with London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Downing Street over the decision to ask her to stay on for two more years, according to media reports.\nThe Met commissioner resisted pressure on her to resign in March when the force came under scrutiny over the handling of a vigil held in memory of Sarah Everard, the marketing executive murdered by then-Met Police constable Wayne Couzens.\nThe force has faced repeated accusations of racial bias in its use of stop-and-search powers and was hit with criticism over the security of Wembley stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championships.\nSince the start of the year, both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the home secretary have publicly backed Dame Cressida.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"The appointment of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service is a formal process which will be confirmed in the proper way.\"\nThe mayor of London and Met Police have declined to comment."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Hospitality industry,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year with the aim of enabling events to go ahead despite surging Covid cases and encouraging the uptake of the vaccine in younger people. \nIt covers large outdoor events, which resumed this week, and venues such as nightclubs and those hosting large indoor events, which can reopen from 24 January.\nPeople over the age of 18 must show - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or have proof of a negative rapid lateral flow test (LFD) or PCR within the previous 24 hours, before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events.\nIf it is more than 120 days since your second jab, you are required to have had a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. \nThe scheme applies to:\nFor nightclubs and smaller events, all people entering should be checked. \nOrganisers of large events are being asked to review 50% or 1,000 vaccine passports of attendees, whichever figure is higher, \nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt, as will employees working at the venues, people taking part in vaccine trials and anyone under the age of 18.\nThe government also said there would be no need for a vaccine passport to access public services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services.\nThe vaccine passport has been updated so that its QR code includes evidence of booster vaccinations.\nThe NHS Scotland Covid Status App is available on Apple and Android devices allows people to register, using their passport or driving licence to verify their identity, and then creates a QR code for each vaccination. \nThose who cannot use the app are able to request what the government describes as \"a secure, uneditable\" paper record. It has enhanced security features, such as thermodynamic ink to prevent forgery, as well as a QR code, and will be valid for three months.\nA QR code verifier app was made available to venues, enabling staff to check a customer's QR code.\nThose who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons will be able to show a document confirming that they are exempt. While under-18s are exempt from the scheme, they may need to show proof of age.\nPeople coming from elsewhere in the UK can show their vaccination status with the NHS App (if from England or Wales) or the Covidcert NI app (if from Northern Ireland) - or via paper letters of certification.\nWhile initially there was no clear definition of what constituted a nightclub, the government later provided some clarification.\nThe vaccine certification scheme applies to any venue that meets all four of the criteria:\nPotentially, a 200-capacity nightclub could be asking for a vaccine passport while a pub next door, with a larger capacity and music playing into the early hours of the morning without dancing or a designated dance floor operating, avoids having to ask customers for their vaccine status.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the rules will be applied in a spirit of pragmatism. As an example, she said a venue required to check vaccine certification at night would not have to check customers coming in for a pub lunch 12 hours earlier.\nThe scheme in England applies to the same venues that are covered in Scotland.\nPeople can only enter if they can show an NHS Covid Pass confirming they have received two doses of an approved vaccine (or a single-dose of Janssen vaccine); a negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test (LFT) result within the last 48 hours; or proof that they have a medical exemption or are taking part in a clinical trial.\nIn Wales, people need to show their NHS Covid Pass or a negative LFT result within the last 24 hours to gain entry to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nPrior to the current restrictions, the scheme also applied to nightclubs and comparable venues, unseated indoor live events for more than 500 people, unseated outdoor live events for more than 4,000 people and any event for more than 10,000 people.\nThe Covid passport scheme in Northern Ireland applies to pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres - as well as nightclubs and large events which are currently closed.\nPeople can either show proof of vaccination, proof of a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours, or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30-180 days.\nThe COVIDCert NI app can be used to show proof of vaccination, or a paper version can be requested."

Its outbreak has claimed 153 lives. \nBut Premier Gladys Berejiklian has stressed people must adjust to having the virus in the community once a majority of society is vaccinated.\nShe declined to nominate a date for reopening but said it would occur on the first Monday after reaching the 70% target.\nNearly 43% of her state's adults are fully vaccinated and 75% have had a first dose, meaning the threshold is likely to be reached next month. \nAt that point, shops and restaurants will be able to reopen with customer limits. Ms Berejiklian did name a date for reopening schools - 25 October.\nShe said only fully vaccinated people would have access to other privileges:\nSubject to distancing restrictions, the following venues will also reopen:\nThere will be a 500-person limit at outdoor seated events, and 50-person limit at weddings and funerals.\nIt's not yet clear how people will prove their vaccination status, but there has been discussion of a vaccination passport or app.\nThe NSW proposal follows a national plan for all of Australia to reopen at 70% and 80% vaccination levels. \nCurrently, more than half of Australia's 25 million people are under lockdown - there are also outbreaks in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory.\nBut Covid-free states like Queensland and Western Australia have rebuffed plans to \"live with the virus\" in the near future, arguing the vaccination threshold should be higher.\nNSW leads the other states in vaccination rates. Nationally, 64% of adults have had at least one dose.\nAustralia has increased its overall vaccine supply to about 10 million doses a week after scrambling to secure Pfizer vaccines from other nations. \nIt recently announced swap deals with the UK, Singapore and Poland.\nBut Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has been criticised for failing to secure more Pfizer doses early on, instead relying heavily on its AstraZeneca supplies.\nEmails released this week by the Labor opposition showed the government had failed to negotiate a Pfizer contract before other Western countries, and had waited to be contacted by the company."

(The first \u00a320,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals).\nHowever, someone with a \u00a3500,000 house would be left with \u00a3414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value.\nFurther changes to the cap were announced last week. \nThe government said:\nSo, if someone's care costs \u00a3860 a week and they are meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap.\nHowever, if the same person receives council help it would take longer than 100 weeks.\nThat means poorer people receiving means-tested help will make contributions from their own money for longer.\nSally Warren, director of policy at The King's Fund health charity said \"These changes will mean that the people who need the most protection from catastrophically high care costs - those with low to moderate levels of wealth - will get less protection than wealthier people.\" \nThe government, however, says it wants to ensure people get support but are not unfairly reaching the cap at an artificially faster rate than others. \nThe cap doesn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people will have to meet these costs \"including after they reach the cap\".\nThe government has confirmed living costs will be up to \u00a3200 a week.\nTen years ago, an independent review by Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a lifetime cap of \u00a335,000 for social care costs - but this was not introduced.\nSir Andrew said the changes the government was now introducing were \"a significant step forward\".\nBut he said the move would not stop the less well-off facing \"catastrophic costs\"."

      "text": "The government is planning to overhaul the travel traffic light system, with changes set to be announced in weeks. \nGreen and amber categories could be removed and replaced with a new system, the BBC has been told.\nA new system would allow vaccinated travellers to go to countries with similarly high levels of vaccination as the UK without the need for quarantine.\nSources say the red category, which is for countries which the government says should not be visited, will remain.\nUnder current restrictions, red countries should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\" and travellers returning from them must self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel.\nThe government declined to comment on the plans but said: \"Our international travel policy is guided by one overwhelming priority - protecting public health. \n\"The next formal checkpoint review will take place by 1 October 2021.\"\nIt is understood that the government has asked senior travel industry leaders to make proposals for international travel to replace the current traffic light system. \nThe government devised the travel traffic light system to limit the transmission of Covid-19 from overseas and protect against new variants coming into the country.\nOne of the key demands from industry bosses is the removal of Covid testing as a necessity of travel back to the UK, which they say puts customers off booking due to cost.\nThis would bring the UK in line with much of European Union, which does not mandate Covid tests for vaccinated travellers within the bloc. It is unclear whether this will happen in the UK. \nTravel industry bosses believe it is crucial that the sector receives a boost of confidence to encourage travellers and holidaymakers to book and travel again. \nThey say the fear caused by category changes is a huge barrier to customers booking and the sector ultimately moving into recovery.\nSudden changes to the traffic light categories for Portugal and Mexico at the start of the summer saw holidaymakers having to rush home at short notice.  \nBosses also point to the \"damaging\" impact on business when commentators speculate on potential changes to countries moving on and off green, amber and red lists, which then prove to be incorrect when government decisions are officially released.\nThe Daily Telegraph first reported that the government was planning to scrap the traffic light system.\nThe third government review of international travel is due by 1 October, but sources say changes could come as soon as next week.\nTravel industry leaders want changes to happen as soon as possible, as the furlough scheme is due to end on 30 September and thousands of travel sector workers are still on the wage support scheme.\nA relaxation in travel rules, they believe, would lead to a bookings surge, which may protect the jobs of those currently on furlough. \nOne industry source said: \"Removing PCR testing for vaccinated passengers is essential. We have to align ourselves with what the rest of Europe are doing and stop being such an outlier. \nThey added that the sector now faces a \"perfect storm\": \"This summer should have been the big reopening of travel - like has happened domestically - but it wasn't because of the insistence on hugely complex and expensive tests.\"\nYesterday, the chief executive of British Airways, Sean Doyle, demanded that the Covid testing and quarantine system is changed, saying it is \"not fit for purpose and must be simplified\".  \nHe added: \"We had the traffic light system over the summer. There was some progress made, but I think it's not fit for purpose. It needs to be simplified and adapted in the same way that we see in Europe and in the US.\nIndustry leaders say they are aware any policy changes will not happen until proposals are signed off by the Chief Scientific Officer and the Health Secretary. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Decisions on our traffic light system are kept under regular review and are informed by the latest risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and wider public health factors.\""

      "text": "Journalists in Afghanistan say that they have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests. \nPhotos circulating online show two journalists from Etilaatroz newspaper with welts and bruises after their arrest in the capital Kabul. \nOne of them, Taqi Daryabi, told the BBC he had been taken to a district police station where he was kicked and beaten. \nOn Wednesday, the BBC's team were also prevented from filming. \nMr Daryabi, alongside Etilaatroz's photographer Nematullah Naqdi, had been covering a women's protest in Kabul on Wednesday. \nAfterwards, they were taken to a police station, where they say they were beaten with batons, electrical cables and whips. A few hours later, they were released by the Taliban, without explanation. \n\"They took me to another room and handcuffed my hands behind me,\" he told the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Kabul. \"I decided not to defend myself because I thought they would just beat me even worse, so I lay down on floor in a position to protect the front of my body. \n\"Eight of them came and they started beating me... Using sticks, police sticks, rubber - whatever they had in their hands. The scar on my face is from shoes where they kicked me in face.\n\"I was unconscious after that so they stopped. They took me to another building where there were cells and left me.\"\nMr Daryabi said he had fallen unconscious after the beating, and that after about two hours he had been released. \n\"I could barely walk but they were telling us to walk quickly. I was in very bad pain.\"\nNematullah Naqdi said Taliban fighters had tried to take away his camera as soon as he started taking photographs of the protest.\n\"One of the Taliban put his foot on my head, crushed my face against the concrete. They kicked me in the head... I thought they were going to kill me,\" Mr Naqdi told AFP news agency.\nHe asked why he was being beaten, only to be told: \"You are lucky you weren't beheaded.\"\nAfghanistan's Tolo news agency reported that its cameraman had been arrested and held by the Taliban for nearly three hours.\nThe CPJ, an international non-governmental organisation, said at least 14 journalists had been detained and then released over the past two days. \n\"The Taliban is quickly proving that earlier promises to allow Afghanistan's independent media to continue operating freely and safely are worthless,\" said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia programme co-ordinator. \n\"We urge the Taliban to live up to those earlier promises, to stop beating and detaining reporters doing their job, and allow the media to work freely without fear of reprisal.\"\nEarlier this week, the Taliban, which seized control of Afghanistan in a sweeping offensive more than three weeks ago, announced the formation of an all-male interim government to rule the country.\nSince then, they have effectively banned protests, declaring them illegal unless permission is sought from the ministry of justice."

      "text": "The Public Health Agency (PHA) is set to take over responsibility for the contact tracing of close contacts of Covid-19 cases in schools, BBC News NI understands.\nIf approved, the move is expected to reduce the number of pupils who have to self-isolate and miss time in school.\nIt is also expected to ease demand for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\nSchools will be urged to encourage pupils to take twice-weekly lateral flow device (LFD) tests.\nThe aim is also to ease the burden placed on principals and school leaders to trace close contacts.\nThe Ulster Teachers' Union said schools had faced a \"tsunami\" of Covid-19 cases and related absences in recent days.\nPrincipals' representatives and teaching unions are expected to be consulted on the plans later.\nThey are similar to arrangements for schools currently in place in England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe change will certainly improve things for school principals and senior school staff who have had to take on the bulk of contact tracing at the minute, when there has been a positive case. \nThey could contact the PHA for advice, but many principals reported it could take a while for them to get that advice. \nReally it has been down to principals and schools to do the bulk of contact tracing when there is a positive case in school. \nI think sometimes they have perhaps been erring on the side of caution, and sending whole year groups home if there has been a positive case, or whole classes. \nI think the PHA might be able to be a bit more forensic in identifying exactly who was a close contact. \nThat means the surge in demand for PCR tests in some parts of Northern Ireland would be somewhat reduced.\nNew self-isolation guidance for schools was issued on 26 August.\nIt changed previous guidance for close contacts to isolate for 10 days and aimed to reduce the time children spent out of school.\nBut the logistical burden of tracing asymptomatic close contacts has, in the main, been the responsibility of school principals and staff.\nThat has also led to high numbers of pupils self-isolating and seeking negative PCR tests to return to school.\nAny child with symptoms is still expected to stay off school and get a PCR test.\nIf that is positive they must self-isolate for 10 days.\nIf the move is approved by principals' representatives and unions, guidance on how the new arrangements will operate will be provided to schools.\nA number of teaching unions in Northern Ireland have called for the PHA to take responsibility for identifying close contacts of pupils in schools.\nPrincipal from Maghaberry Primary School and President of National Association of Headteachers NI (NAHTni) Graham Gault said the development was a \"significant step\".\nHe said contact tracing should never have fallen to school leaders.\nChris Donnelly, principal of St John The Baptist Primary School in Finaghy, said that while schools \"will welcome the easing of any type of administrative burden associated with contact tracing\" it was the case that \"the devil will be in the detail\". \nJustin McCamphill from teachers' union NASUWT said that while taking the job of contact tracing \"away from school principals\" was welcome, the union was urging caution around the proposals. \n\"We do worry that the PHA may not have the capacity to identify close cases as quickly as school principals did,\" Mr McCamphill told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"The experience of our leaders over the past few weeks has been that they have difficulty getting through to the PHA advice line.\n\"We think now if parents and pupils are making direct contact we don't know if the capacity is going to be there.\n\"The other issue of course is that if a six or seven-year-old is a close contact and gives their friend's name, how are the PHA going to make contact with that friend without going back through the school?\"\nMr McCamphill added that the union did not see the plan as \"something that's going to fix everything straight away\".\nIn England, Scotland and Wales public health authorities take on the responsibility for tracing close contacts of school pupils.\nIn Wales, for instance, the Test, Trace and Protect (TTP) programme gathers information from positive cases on their close contacts.\nChildren under 16 are spoken to alongside a parent or guardian.\nThe public health authorities, rather than schools, then advise close contacts whether they have to self-isolate or seek a PCR test.\nSimilar arrangements are in place in Scotland with the aim that whole classes or year groups are not routinely asked to stay at home in the event of a positive case."

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,Ministry of Defence",
      "text": "Defence Minister Jeremy Quin has said he \"cannot 100% promise\" that noise and vibration problems with the Army's new fleet of armoured vehicles can be resolved.\nHe told MPs the programme remains \"troubled\" and said he could give no deadline for issues to be sorted out.\nIt comes after the Ministry of Defence confirmed more than 300 soldiers are being assessed for hearing loss. \nLabour said the programme is on \"end of life watch\".\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) signed a contract for 589 of the Ajax armoured vehicles in 2014 and has already spent nearly \u00a33.5bn on the troubled flagship programme.\nThe vehicles, which are fully digital, were billed as the \"next generation\" of armoured vehicles but have been beset by problems.\nTrials were halted in March and again in June after crews reported problems with noise and vibration. \nThe future of the British Army's most expensive equipment programme hangs in the balance. \nEven the Ministry of Defence now calls Ajax \"a troubled programme\". \nSome MPs think it's worse than that - only a matter of time before it has to be cancelled. \nLabour says Ajax is on a death watch and someone needs to be held responsible for what's gone wrong.  \nThe Army - never the most transparent organisation -  knew of the problems with noise and vibration years ago. \nDefence Minister Jeremy Quin has at least been willing to lay out the facts. By doing so he's piling on the pressure on the main contractor, General Dynamics, UK. \nMr Quin says he still hopes they will successfully complete the programme. But he's not giving any guarantees. \nNor is he willing to say how much longer he's prepared to wait.\nMaking a statement in the Commons, Mr Quin confirmed independent trials had resumed at the testing site, Milbrook. \nHe said time and space was needed to get results and data would not be available this month because \"considerable work needs to be undertaken\". \nAnd he admitted that vibration concerns were raised before trials first began in 2019. \nBut he said he hoped issues could be rectified and the vehicles brought in to service.\nAn independent report by the MoD's director of health and safety would also look at the concerns raised, he added. \nHe said: \"I have previously described Ajax as a troubled programme. It is, but that does not mean that the problems are irresolvable.\"\nThe system represents a step-change in the capabilities of the British Army, he added, but he said that ministers would \"never accept a vehicle that does not meet our testing requirements\" and would work with the manufacturer, General Dynamics, to fix the outstanding issues. \nConservative former defence minister, Mark Francois, told the Commons Ajax is an example of why the MoD's procurement process is \"completely broken\".\nHe said that analysis of the top 36 MoD programmes showed that the Ajax programme was \"red, unlikely ever to be achieved\".\nHe said: \"How many were green? Successfully on track of the 36?\n\"None, zero, zilch, nothing. Not one major MoD procurement programme is successfully on track. \n\"This is over a \u00a3100bn of British taxpayers' money.\"\nHe added: \"You have got a broken system and you are in total denial. What are you going to do about it?\"\nLabour's shadow defence minister, John Healey, said it was a \"shocking\" admission that \"it is not possible to determine a realistic timetable\" for Ajax's introduction into service could be given. \nHe said that it had gone \"from bad to worse\" since ministers last updated MPs three months ago. \n\"This is a programme that has cost \u00a33.5bn to date, delivered just 14 vehicles and is set to be completed a decade late. \n\"The minister's statement now puts Ajax on an end of life watch,\" he added.

      "text": "A health board has restricted visiting because of rising numbers of Covid-positive patients.\nPeople have been asked not to visit Cwm Taf Morgannwg's hospitals in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf from Friday.\nThe health board said in a statement it was for \"the safety of our patients and staff\".\nThere are some exceptions to the restrictions, including end-of-life patients and women in labour.\nWales' fourth biggest health board covers a population of about 450,000 people and is the hardest hit area of Wales during the pandemic with 1545 Covid deaths.\nThe health board's director of public health Kelechi Nnoaham previously warned of a \"very difficult autumn and winter\" for the Welsh NHS. \nHe said although hospital admissions were lower due to vaccinations, the current trend in cases was worrying.\nAt the time, there were 67 Covid patients in its hospitals, which include major facilities in Merthyr, Bridgend and Llantisant - the highest since mid-February.\nLatest figures showed a spike in cases of confirmed cases in the health board's hospitals in recent days.\nThere were 112 patients with Covid in beds on Wednesday; at the end of June, there were no confirmed Covid patients at all in its beds.\nThe number has risen by 65% week although still only half the numbers we saw at the same point in the second wave.\nBut the numbers in critical care with Covid are the highest of any Welsh health board and close to matching the numbers critically ill with other conditions.\nAnother complication has been a rise in hospital-acquired infections in the health board, with 26 probable and definite Covid infections reported by Public Health Wales in the latest week.\nPatients catching Covid once inside hospitals became a major issue for the health board last autumn.\nOut in the community, there has been a spike in Covid cases, especially in Merthyr Tydfil.\nIt has shown the highest proportional growth in the UK and is now the 15th highest of all local authorities.\nIts case rate - 812.25 cases per 100,000 population - follows 490 positive tests in the past week. It was last this high on Christmas Eve, although back then the situation was different - it was early on in the vaccine roll-out and full restrictions had started. \nThe health boards' director of nursing and midwifery, Greg Dix, said: \"Despite easing of some restrictions in society, we are still very much living in a pandemic, and the numbers of patients ill with Covid and needing hospital care is rising each day. \n\"Taking this difficult decision to restrict visiting allows us to control the levels of Covid in our hospitals, keeping our patients and staff as safe as possible.\"\nUnder the new rules, visitors will only be allowed for those receiving end-of-life care, while one partner or support person will be able to accompany a woman in labour.\nA partner will also be able to attend ultrasound appointments, while all outpatients must attend alone.\nThe health board encouraged patients to use the free WiFi available to keep in contact with loved ones."

For the first time they looked rattled\", industry sources told the BBC.  \nIt's thought the centrepiece of the proposals could include combining the Class C test used for rigid lorries and Class E for larger articulated lorries into a single test. \nCurrently, there is usually a 2-3 week minimum period between taking the two tests.   \nThe haulage industry said a perfect storm of a post-Brexit exodus of drivers, an ageing and retiring workforce and COVID-related delays to testing new drivers had brought some supply chains to breaking point.\nHaulage firms, desperate for drivers to fill lorries left idle and to complete orders left unfulfilled, welcomed the move but warned that it would not be enough to fix the cracks appearing in supply chains.\nThey reiterated their calls for HGV drivers to be added to the Shortage Occupation List which would allow firms to temporarily bring back some of the estimated 20,000 EU drivers who have left the industry. \nPaul Jackson of Chiltern Distribution said: \"This is a sensible move but it's not enough to fix the problem. \n\"We don't put newly qualified drivers straight behind the wheel on their own. We buddy them up with experienced drivers for the first 8-10 weeks and the insurance costs for new drivers are also much higher. \n\"We desperately need to put HGV drivers on the list of skilled workers we can bring in from abroad.\"\nThe Chemical Business Association, which represents chemical firms within the supply chain, reiterated concerns that its members were struggling to get chemicals to water companies.\nTim Doggett, its chief executive, said: \"The supply chain situation in the UK is deteriorating.\" \nA survey conducted by the industry group suggests 96% of member companies are now experiencing issues with UK haulage, up from 63% in its last survey in June.\nThe Chemical Business Association has written to ministers warning about the effects of driver shortages.\nThe group write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June, saying that \"there was a contingent risk to the supply of chemicals into vital areas such as water treatment, which would be critical to the health and wellbeing of the population\".\nThe government is expected to say that the new regime will mean up to 3,000 new drivers can be tested per week. \nCurrently the pass rate is 56% so that would mean an extra 1,600 drivers per week. \nBut Richard Burnett of the Road Haulage Association said the industry was losing 600 drivers a week from the industry and with a net shortfall of 90,000 drivers, it would take nearly two years to fill the gap.  \nThe industry was already reporting shortages of about 60,000 drivers before Brexit and the pandemic. \nEven allowing for that, he said there was no way to plug the recent gaps in time for Christmas - when the UK is more reliant on EU food imports.  \nIn addition, the RHA said the onset of winter weather would throw up obstacles. \"The reality is that an industry already struggling to meet delivery schedules will be brought to its knees at the first outbreak of bad weather conditions.\" \nThe managing director of BJS Distribution Storage and Couriers, Harinder Singh, said the new shorter test was \"not a solution it is a risk\".\n\"Making the test easier does not make better drivers. The solution to the current shortage is to allow temporary visas to drivers from countries that understand the legislation and legal driving parameters of the UK, otherwise this isn't going to solve itself. \n\"By making the test easier you are putting more risk onto the road,\" he added.

      "text": "Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes \"lied and cheated\" for money and fame, prosecutors alleged on the first day of the former Silicon Valley star's trial. \nMs Holmes faces 12 fraud charges over her role at the now-defunct blood-testing firm which was once worth $9bn.\nShe is accused of deceiving investors and patients by claiming Theranos could detect common illnesses using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick.\nHer lawyers said she was simply a naive businesswoman whose firm failed.\n\"Failure is not a crime. Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime,\" Lance Wade, a lawyer for the defence said in his opening statement on Wednesday. \nIn what will be a closely watched trial in San Jose, California, Ms Holmes denies all the charges against her but could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.\nFormer Theranos executive Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani - who was romantically involved with Ms Holmes for years - faces the same charges but will be tried separately next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.\nMs Holmes, who founded Theranos in 2003 aged 19, was dubbed the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and the \"next Steve Jobs\" thanks to her technology.\nHowever, she fell from grace in 2015 when it emerged her blood-testing devices did not work and Theranos was doing most of its testing on commercially available machines made by other manufacturers.\nOn Wednesday, prosecutor Robert Leach said Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani turned to fraud in 2009 after big pharmaceutical firms declined to back Theranos and they ran out of cash. \nThey lied about the tests and exaggerated the firm's performance to secure millions of dollars of investment between 2010 and 2015. \nThis included falsely claiming the tests had been vetted by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and that the technology was being used by the US military in the field, Mr Leach said. \nMs Holmes came into the court surrounded by her legal team. There's huge interest in the case here.\nJournalists had been queuing up since 5am to try and get into court. Many didn't get in.\nEschewing the black turtleneck she had become famous for, Ms Holmes wore a grey suit and blue mask. In court, she sat bolt upright, poised, attentive, as she listened to the case against her.\nThe prosecution didn't mince its words. The word \"lies\" was mentioned liberally. Ms Holmes watched on passively.\nThe case will probably take months and at some point it's possible that Ms Holmes herself will take the stand. \nIf she does it will be a huge risk for her defence. But with so much evidence that the tech she flaunted didn't work she may feel it's a risk worth taking.\nMs Holmes also \"dazzled\" firms such as Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, into agreeing testing partnerships, despite being fully aware the tests were \"plagued by issues and repeatedly failing quality control\", he said. \nIt brought her fame and adoration, Mr Leach added.\n\"She had become, as she sought, one of the most celebrated CEOs in Silicon Valley and the world. But under the facade of Theranos' success there were significant problems brewing.\"\nHowever, the defence's Mr Wade said Ms Holmes did not intend to defraud, but instead \"naively underestimated\" the challenges her business faced. \n\"In the end, Theranos failed and Ms Holmes walked away with nothing,\" he told the jurors in San Jose. \nHe added that the former executive was motivated by Theranos's mission, not money, and \"committed to that mission until that very last day\".\n\"By the time this trial is over, you will see that the villain the government just presented is actually a living, breathing human being who did her very best each and every day. And she is innocent.\"\nAccording to court filings unsealed last month, Ms Holmes has alleged Mr Balwani abused her emotionally and psychologically for years. Mr Balwani has denied the allegations.\nHer lawyers have said she is \"highly likely\" to take the witness stand and testify about how the relationship affected her mental state. \nAs boss of Theranos Ms Holmes is alleged to have duped a host of powerful people who invested around $700m in the company. Henry Kissinger and four star general James Mattis sat on the company's board while Rupert Murdoch invested \u00a3120m.\nHer story has become the subject of documentaries, podcasts and books. A TV miniseries and a Hollywood film based her life are in the works.\nThe defence and prosecution have identified more than 140 potential witnesses in the case, including investors and former Theranos employees."

In the end it made 609 people redundant. \nThe coffee chain said it now needs more staff to support new stores and rising demand as it prepares for the typically-busy festive period.\nOn average, store team members will take home \u00a3500-\u00a3900 more per year once the wage increase comes into effect from 1 October.\nCosta owns 1,500 stores in the UK, while another 1,200 stores are franchise-owned.\nThe pay rise does not include workers at franchise-owned stores.\n\"Our team members are the heart of our business and as we continue to emerge stronger from the pandemic, this 5% pay increase is one way we are able to show our thanks to them,\" said Neil Lake, managing director of Costa Coffee UK & Ireland.\n\"Our teams have been through the most challenging year and a half in living memory and have shown incredible passion, resilience, and commitment as they continue to serve perfectly crafted cups of Costa coffee to consumers across the country.\"\nCosta said all store team members would receive a pay increase of at least 45p per hour, meaning minimum pay for the role will rise from \u00a38.91 to \u00a39.36 per hour.\nStaff at the rank of \"Barista Maestro\", who oversee how the coffee is made and manage branches, will receive a pay rise of 65p per hour, bringing their minimum pay up from \u00a39.64 to \u00a310.29 per hour.\nWhile top rates of pay vary according to location and experience, Costa said the top rate for store staff would go up from \u00a310.64 to \u00a311.29 per hour.

      "tags": "Attorney General,Darlington,Sentencing in England and Wales",
      "text": "The sentence given to a man who choked a woman to death during sex is being reviewed by the Attorney General to decide if it was unduly lenient.\nSam Pybus, 32, was jailed for four years and eight months after admitting the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, 33, at her home in Darlington on 7 February.\nCampaigners said the \"outrageous\" sentence sent a \"dreadful message\".\nReferring the sentence for review, MP Harriet Harman said it \"fails to reflect the gravity of the crime\".\nA spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said the review under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme would take place within 28 days and, if successful, the case would be referred to the Court of Appeal.\nMs Harman said Pybus' \"disgraceful mitigation\" that Ms Moss, a mother of two young boys, encouraged strangulation during sex made it sound as if it was \"her fault\".\n\"[Pybus] sought to shift the responsibility for Sophie's death from himself to her claiming that she both encouraged and enjoyed his placing pressure on her neck,\" Ms Harman said.\nThe MP said: \"The sentence fails to reflect the gravity of the crime, the impact of her death on her family, his sole culpability for her death, his cynical shifting of the responsibility from himself to her and sends out the message that killing your girlfriend during sex is a minor matter.\"\nWe Can't Consent To This, a campaign group set up in response to so-called \"consensual\" violence claims against women, also criticised the sentence.\nSpokeswoman Fiona Mackenzie said: \"It seems that strangling a woman to death is still viewed in law as an unfortunate accident, rather than terrible serious violence.\n\"This sends a dreadful message to women - four years and eight months is an outrageous sentence.\nThe Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows anyone to lobby the Attorney General to send a case to the Court of Appeal for review. Very experienced senior judges then consider the term given to an offender and how it compares to any relevant guidelines on sentencing and previous similar crimes. \nJudge Paul Watson reduced Pybus' initial sentence of seven years because the law required him to give the killer a discount for his early admission that he was guilty of manslaughter - the crime of unintentionally causing Ms Moss' death. \nPybus said he never intended to kill, leading to the Crown Prosecution Service ruling out a murder charge. But he could not avoid a manslaughter conviction by claiming it was \"rough sex gone wrong\". \nSome 28 years ago, the UK's then most senior judges declared that nobody can consent to serious harm as part of sado-masochistic sex - a ruling that was recently reasserted in the 2021 Domestic Abuse Act.\nPybus, who was married, had been seeing Ms Moss for sex about six times a year for three years without his wife's knowledge,  Teesside Crown Court previously heard.\nOn 6 February he had drunk 24 bottles of Amstel lager over 10 hours, and drove to Ms Moss's flat after his wife went to bed.\nAt 04:43 GMT the following morning he drove to Darlington police station and told staff he believed he had strangled Ms Moss.\nHe said that during sex he would apply pressure to her neck, \"an act he said she encouraged\", but added he would never hurt her.\nThe claim she encouraged strangulation during sex was confirmed by her long-term partner, the court heard.\nInstead of giving Ms Moss first aid, Pybus went to his car and thought about what to do for 15 minutes before driving to the police station, the court was told.\nOn Tuesday Judge Paul Watson QC said he accepted Pybus, of Water View, Middleton St George, Darlington, did not intend to kill and believed he had genuine remorse.\nIn a victim statement Ms Moss's brother said she had been \"taken advantage of and exploited\".\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "The government is planning to overhaul the travel traffic light system, with changes set to be announced in weeks. \nGreen and amber categories could be removed and replaced with a new system, the BBC has been told.\nA new system would allow vaccinated travellers to go to countries with similarly high levels of vaccination as the UK without the need for quarantine.\nSources say the red category, which is for countries which the government says should not be visited, will remain.\nUnder current restrictions, red countries should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\" and travellers returning from them must self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel.\nThe government declined to comment on the plans but said: \"Our international travel policy is guided by one overwhelming priority - protecting public health. \n\"The next formal checkpoint review will take place by 1 October 2021.\"\nIt is understood that the government has asked senior travel industry leaders to make proposals for international travel to replace the current traffic light system. \nThe government devised the travel traffic light system to limit the transmission of Covid-19 from overseas and protect against new variants coming into the country.\nOne of the key demands from industry bosses is the removal of Covid testing as a necessity of travel back to the UK, which they say puts customers off booking due to cost.\nThis would bring the UK in line with much of European Union, which does not mandate Covid tests for vaccinated travellers within the bloc. It is unclear whether this will happen in the UK. \nTravel industry bosses believe it is crucial that the sector receives a boost of confidence to encourage travellers and holidaymakers to book and travel again. \nThey say the fear caused by category changes is a huge barrier to customers booking and the sector ultimately moving into recovery.\nSudden changes to the traffic light categories for Portugal and Mexico at the start of the summer saw holidaymakers having to rush home at short notice.  \nBosses also point to the \"damaging\" impact on business when commentators speculate on potential changes to countries moving on and off green, amber and red lists, which then prove to be incorrect when government decisions are officially released.\nThe Daily Telegraph first reported that the government was planning to scrap the traffic light system.\nThe third government review of international travel is due by 1 October, but sources say changes could come as soon as next week.\nTravel industry leaders want changes to happen as soon as possible, as the furlough scheme is due to end on 30 September and thousands of travel sector workers are still on the wage support scheme.\nA relaxation in travel rules, they believe, would lead to a bookings surge, which may protect the jobs of those currently on furlough. \nOne industry source said: \"Removing PCR testing for vaccinated passengers is essential. We have to align ourselves with what the rest of Europe are doing and stop being such an outlier. \nThey added that the sector now faces a \"perfect storm\": \"This summer should have been the big reopening of travel - like has happened domestically - but it wasn't because of the insistence on hugely complex and expensive tests.\"\nYesterday, the chief executive of British Airways, Sean Doyle, demanded that the Covid testing and quarantine system is changed, saying it is \"not fit for purpose and must be simplified\".  \nHe added: \"We had the traffic light system over the summer. There was some progress made, but I think it's not fit for purpose. It needs to be simplified and adapted in the same way that we see in Europe and in the US.\nIndustry leaders say they are aware any policy changes will not happen until proposals are signed off by the Chief Scientific Officer and the Health Secretary. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Decisions on our traffic light system are kept under regular review and are informed by the latest risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and wider public health factors.\""

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,UK immigration,Boris Johnson,Refugees and asylum seekers,Europe migrant crisis,Migration",
      "text": "France has hit out at the UK over plans to turn back some boats carrying migrants across the Channel to England.\nThe government wants the Border Force to turn away boats - but only in limited circumstances under a pre-authorised policy signed off by Home Secretary Priti Patel.\nFrance said this would break international maritime law, and also accused the UK of financial blackmail.\nBoris Johnson's spokesman has said any new plans will be safe and legal.\nThe UK's Border Force has been training for months to use the highly controversial tactic of turning boats back in certain circumstances.\nGovernment sources told the BBC that the final training may take place within days, subject to the weather, meaning the tactic could be in place and ready to be used whenever the UK thinks it is practical, safe and legal to do so.\nBut France - as well as campaigners and critics - have questioned the legality of the plan. They believe it breaks international maritime law, which says people at risk of losing their lives at sea must be rescued.\nThe government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be. \nIn a strongly worded tweet, French interior minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said France would not accept any practice that breaks maritime law.\n\"UK's commitment must be kept,\" he said. \"I clearly said it to my counterpart Priti Patel. The friendship between our two countries deserves better than posturing which undermines the cooperation between our ministries\".\nHe also accused the UK of financial blackmail - referring to a deal the UK and France struck over money earlier this year, when the British government promised to pay \u00a354.2m for extra action on the French side of the Channel such as doubling the number of coast patrols. \nSince then, Ms Patel has warned that Britain could withhold the money, unless more boats are intercepted.\nThe PM's spokesman rejected those accusations, saying the government has \"provided our French counterparts significant sums of money previously, and we've agreed another bilateral agreement backed by millions of pounds\".\nAnd he said: \"Any approach Border Force use is safe and legal. Our operational activities comply with domestic and international law.\"\nHe added that \"we continue to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options\" and any approach \"is tested through multiple sea trials\".\nThe UK has a legal right to intercept people at sea where necessary to prevent crime or to protect borders.  \nBut whatever the legal advice the UK government has received on migrant boats, it's questionable whether such an operation could continue once there is a clear sign of danger. \nBorder Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. \nSo their window of opportunity to run a push-back operation could be very tight. \nBut more importantly\u2026 is this really ever going to happen? \nThe intervention from the French interior minister may have just sunk the operation before a single Border Force ship has set sail. \nThere are no international waters in the Dover Strait - so any operation would need French co-operation. \nAnd G\u00e9rald Darmanin's statement makes clear France's opposition to any confrontation of dinghies in one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes.\nCharities and opposition politicians have also criticised the plan.\nThe British Red Cross said it was concerned that sending people back to sea could \"make already treacherous journeys even more perilous\".\n\"Crossing the Channel in a small boat is only ever a desperate last resort, and an extremely dangerous one. When people's lives are in danger they need help, compassion and humanity, not to have their ordeal extended.\"\nAmnesty International UK said people \"only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them\".\nAnd the boss of charity Refugee Action said the policy was \"about bullying refugees to score political points rather than breaking up smuggling gangs.\n\"We all want the boats to stop but this plan massively increases the chances of families drowning at sea.\"\nLabour also said the tactic risks lives, adding: \"That the home secretary is even considering these dangerous proposals shows how badly she has lost control of this situation.\"\nRising numbers of migrants have been crossing the English Channel in recent months - since Sunday more than 1,700 people have crossed by boat. \nAnd in total this year, more than 14,000 migrants have made the journey across.\nThe Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities.\nThe government has previously spoken of cracking down on the organised crime gangs who smuggle people across the Channel, often for profit. \nOn Thursday, No 10 said the public expects the government to act. \n\"We know this is a long-standing problem that the public expect us to address. It simply cannot be right that dangerous... that criminal gangs are able to exploit our most vulnerable and put their lives at risk.\n\"It needs to be addressed, it's what the public want, and it's what we're doing.\" "

      "text": "Care Minister Helen Whately has admitted that putting into effect the cap on social care costs is \"a little way off\" but said it is a \"big reform that takes time to implement\". \nMPs last night voted to approve a rise in National Insurance to help fund health and social care.\nIt limits care bills faced by people in England to \u00a386,000 from October 2023. \nBut critics say the system is in crisis now and most of the funding will be swallowed up by the NHS. \nMPs voted by 319 to 248 for a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance next year for both workers and employers, to help deal with the crisis in health and social care as the UK emerges from the pandemic. \nIn 2023, National Insurance will return to its previous level and the tax increase will become a separate health and social care levy on earnings.\nThe measures will raise an extra \u00a312bn a year over three years and the prime minister has said the majority of the \u00a336bn fund will go towards dealing with the waiting list backlog in the NHS which has reached a record high. \nAround 15% of the money - \u00a35.4bn in total - will go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nBut there are fears that the demands on the money from the health service will continue, and not enough funding will be left to tackle the growing problems in social care. \nThe draft legislation for the new Health and Social Care Levy shows how the money raised will be legally ringfenced to be spent on health and social care, but gives the Treasury the power to decide the split.\nThis is likely to reinforce fears amongst MPs that the funds will be monopolised by the health service and never reach the care sector. \nIn the Commons on Wednesday, Conservative Jake Berry said he was \"very concerned that this tax is not really a health and social care tax, it's actually a Trojan horse for an NHS tax\".\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Whately denied it was a possibility that social care could lose out. \nShe said ministers had \"seized\" the challenge after successive government had talked for decades about overhauling the system but had failed to get reforms through.\nShe said some of the extra funding would start going in to social care from April 2022, but the new cap on costs, that ensures no-one in England will have to pay more than \u00a386,000 - not including food or accommodation - will not take effect until 18 months later.\nShe praised the measure, which only applies to new claimants from October 2023 and not those already in the system, as a way to give people \"peace of mind\". \nShe said: \"This big policy to put in place a cap on the amount that you might face for the cost of your care, that does simply take time to implement.\n\"We can't turn it on tomorrow.\n\"We will turn it on as soon as we can and that will then give people the peace of mind that they won't face those huge care bills that some face at the minute.\"\nLabour says the government has broken its promise that people will not have to sell their home in order to pay for the help they need. \nSpeaking in the debate on Tuesday evening, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said under Mr Johnson's plan \"someone with a house worth \u00a3186,000 would still have to pay \u00a386,000 even with this cap - and that's before living costs of going into a care home.\"\n\"How does the chancellor suggest they pay those fees without selling their home?\" she asked.\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

      "text": "Ant and Dec have underlined their status as the nation's favourite TV hosts after their 20th consecutive win at the National Television Awards.\nThe pair, whose full names are Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, have won the best TV presenter trophy at every NTAs ceremony since 2001.\nDonnelly described their win as \"overwhelming\", while McPartlin said: \"You've no idea how special this is.\"\nThe night's other winners included Line of Duty, Gogglebox and It's A Sin.\nThe BBC, ITV and Channel 4 dominated the top categories - with the Ricky Gervais's Netflix comedy After Life marking the only prize for a streaming service.\nAccepting their 20th award for best TV presenter, McPartlin said: \"Thank you very much indeed. \n\"We were talking in the car on the way here and the first year we won a NTA, Tony Blair was the prime minster and Newcastle United qualified for the Champions league. That just goes to show how long ago that was.\n\"But this one means the most - 20 years, I'm shaking.\"\nDonnelly added: \"It's pretty overwhelming to be honest with you. So much has changed in both of our lives since 2001, but one thing that hasn't changed is how unbelievably grateful we are that you take time, year after year, to vote for us and put us up here.\"\n\"We are so honoured and humbled and grateful. It means the absolute world.\"\nLine of Duty received a special recognition award and was also named best returning drama, despite complaints from some viewers who were disappointed by the conclusion of the sixth series. \n\"This means so much,\" said star Martin Compston as he thanked viewers and paid tribute to creator Jed Mercurio. \n\"We started as a wee show on Wednesday night on BBC Two, and now we're the biggest drama on TV. And it's all because of the fans, we owe everything to you,\" \n\"We genuinely don't take this for granted, thank you and who knows - maybe we'll be back again.\"\nAccepting the prize for best factual programme, Gogglebox star Julie Malone paid tribute to the four stars of the show who have died since the last NTAs ceremony - Andrew Michael,Pete McGarry,Mary Cook and June Bernicoff.\n\"I'd like to dedicate this award to all the people we've lost sadly over the past 18 months,\" Malone said. \"Andy, Pete, Mary and everybody's favourite grandma, June, who's now reunited with Leon.\" \nKate Garraway won the new authored documentary category for Finding Derek, which followed her husband Derek Draper's long battle with Covid-19.\nDraper battled with the virus which had ravaged his body for more than a year before finally returning home in April.\n\"Thank you so much for voting,\" Garraway said. \"I wonder if the reason why you did is that our story is your story. I think we've all been touched by the pandemic, whether it's livelihoods, mental health, all the other extraordinary documentaries that have been highlighted and nominated tonight, they've also been affected by the pandemic.\"\nShe told families still suffering the effects of coronavirus: \"Whatever you're going through, you're not forgotten. We want the joy back. We want it to be over, but if you're still living with the scars, the fight goes on. \n\"But most of all, Derek, who should be here and should have had the chance to tell his own story - Derek, you're going to get the chance, believe. The hope is real.\"\nChannel 4 drama It's a Sin, which followed a group of friends in the 1980s during the Aids crisis, was named best new drama.\n\"Honestly this show is so brilliant from everybody in the cast to the crew, production, behind the scenes. It was the hugest privilege of my life to be a part of it,\" said the show's star Olly Alexander.\nWriter Russell T Davies added: \"This is a story in which many people lost their lives, so it's nice to dedicate this to those we lost, those who lived, those who learned, and those we loved.\"\nA video montage introduced by Sir Trevor McDonald reflected on the impact Covid-19 had on the UK, as well as rounding up other major news events since the last NTAs ceremony aired in January 2020.\nThe death of the Duke of Edinburgh, Prime Minister Boris Johnson being admitted into intensive care after contracting Covid-19, the announcement of the vaccine and England making it to the Euro 2020 final were all highlighted in the montage which reflected an eventful 18 months for the UK.\nSerial drama - Coronation Street\nTalent show - Strictly Come Dancing\nBruce Forsyth entertainment award - I'm A Celebrity...

It was amazing to know we were a part of a strange time. Thank you very much!\"\nThis Morning was named best daytime programme, with host Philip Schofield telling the audience: \"The last 18 months have been amazing for all of us.\"\nReferring to the disruption caused by the pandemic, he said: \"Because of the brilliance of ITV and our team, we could stay on air. We felt like we were everyone's comfort blanket, and you [the viewers] were our comfort blanket, and we were all in it together.\"\nThe Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood also acknowledged the impact of the pandemic while accepting the award for best challenge show.\n\"A big thank you for this award, it means a lot to everybody,\" said Hollywood. \"Last year was particularly difficult during Covid, but we had to do the show because we wanted to put a smile on your faces.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Companies,Three,Mobile phones,Brexit",
      "text": "Three is the latest mobile network to announce it is reintroducing roaming charges between the UK and Europe. \nFrom 23 May 2022, customers who have taken out a new or upgraded contract after 1 October will have to pay \u00a32 a day to use their monthly allowance of minutes, texts and data in the EU. \nIt follows similar announcements from EE and Vodafone earlier this year. \nThree is also extending changes to other destinations, introducing a \u00a35 a day charge for roaming outside Europe.\nThe move effectively ends Three's long-standing roaming feature, branded \"Go Roam\", which allowed customers to use their contract allowances in 71 countries, including distant locations such as the USA, Hong Kong and Australia.  \n\"This is a huge blow to Three customers,\" said Paolo Pescatore, a telecoms analyst at PP Foresight.\n\"Free roaming to so many destinations helped lure and retain users. Now this is no longer a differentiator, it will be hard for Three to stand out in an increasingly crowded and cut-throat market,\" he warned.\nIn a statement, Three said: \"The new charge ensures that customers are clear on what they will pay when using their phone in another country and only those who roam will pay for the service.\n\"It will also ensure that we can continue investing in our UK network.\" \nThe change does not affect roaming to Ireland or in the Isle of Man. \nMobile operators have also said they are under pressure from rising costs, including wholesale costs which can be much higher for UK networks. \nUnder EU rules, citizens could use their contract's minutes, texts, and data while roaming in the EU. But that is no longer the case post-Brexit as the trade deal did not include it. \nUK law does, however, cap roaming charges at \u00a345 per month, unless the user explicitly decides to spend more. \nAll major UK operators had previously said they had no plans to reintroduce roaming fees in Europe. \nEE was the first to break ranks and announce that it would do so, followed by Vodafone. \nO2 said there is currently no change in its stated position - that it has no plans to change roaming fees.\nIn a statement, Sky Mobile said: \"Customers will not be charged roaming charges in EU countries and will be able to continue to use their data, call and text allowances as they do in the UK.\" "

      "text": "Almost 60% of oil and gas reserves and 90% of coal must remain in the ground to keep global warming below 1.5C, scientists say.\nThe forecast is based on close analysis of global energy supply and demand. \nIt is a \"bleak\" but realistic assessment of \"what the science tells us is needed\", the researchers say.\nAnd they have \"painted a scenario of the future\" that leaves much less room for fossil fuels to be extracted than previously estimated. \nScientists say that limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C should help the world avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change.\nGlobally, the researchers calculated, production of fossil fuels needed to have peaked in 2020 and be on a steady decline of 3% every year until 2050. \n\"Through the Covid pandemic, we have seen a large decline in production - but that is bouncing back,\" UCL associate professor of energy systems Dr Steve Pye told BBC News.  \nThe research focuses on how much energy is required and what the limit must be on carbon emissions. \nDr James Price, also at UCL, said: \"We say to our model, 'Meet all those demands from now until 2100 without emitting too much carbon dioxide.'\n\"The result we get is a rapid reduction in fossil fuels - and a large amount of fossils fuels [left in the ground] - simply because the carbon budget is so tight.\" \nThe study, in the journal Nature, also found the decline in oil and gas production required globally by 2050 - to stick to that tight carbon budget - means many regions face peak production now or during the next decade. \nA carbon budget is the cumulative amount of CO2 that can be released in a period of time while keeping within a temperature threshold - in this case 1.5C.\nMany fossil-fuel extraction projects already planned or in operation are likely to hurt the world's chances of meeting internationally agreed target limits on global warming set out by the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nAnd this \"bleak picture\", the scientists say, \"is very probably an underestimate of what is required\". \nThe carbon budget determined by the modelling  would give the world a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. \nBut the study says: \"That does not consider uncertainties around, for example, climate-system feedbacks\n\"So to ensure more certainty of stabilising at this temperature, [even] more carbon needs to stay in the ground.\"\nThe researchers highlight bold national policies to entirely phase out fossil-fuel extraction, including an alliance devised by Costa Rica and Denmark, set to be launched at the crucial United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Glasgow, this year, asking states to stop issuing fossil-fuel exploration permits. \nAnd the scientists say they hope the \"stark numbers\" will inspire the political will to make swift and urgent change to move away from a reliance on fossil fuels.  \nDr Price told the BBC: \"The physics doesn't care about the political will. \n\"We know technically how to do this, it is just about actually doing it.\"  \nFollow Victoria on Twitter."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Scottish government,John Swinney,Scottish Parliament,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "People in Scotland will need proof they have been fully vaccinated before they can enter nightclubs and many large events from 1 October.\nThe vaccine passport plan was formally approved by Holyrood after the SNP and Greens voted in favour. \nSome businesses have complained of a lack of detail about how the scheme will work in practice. \nThe proposals were opposed by the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats. \nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said the system would reduce the risk of transmission and help prevent venues - many of which have only recently reopened - from having to close again due to Covid.\nA paper published by the government on Thursday morning, just hours before the vote in the Scottish Parliament, said officials were still working to define what a nightclub actually is.\nAnd it said evidence was still being gathered about the effectiveness of similar schemes elsewhere in the world.\nPeople in England will need to have a \"Covid pass\" to access \"higher risk\" settings such as nightclubs from the end of this month.\nThere are no current plans to introduce a similar scheme in Wales or Northern Ireland.\nThe new rules will mean people over the age of 18 in Scotland will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: \nIt means that many major sporting events - particularly football matches - will be affected, as will concerts and music festivals.\nPeople who have had two vaccines in Scotland can already download or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code.\nBy the end of the month, it is expected that this code will also be available on a new NHS Scotland Status app.\nThese codes can be scanned at a venue to confirm the user is fully vaccinated.\nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. \nA major goal of the scheme is to encourage more younger people to be vaccinated - with the latest figures showing that uptake among those under the age of 40 in Scotland has been lower than older age groups. \nMany areas of Scotland have seen some of the highest Covid rates in Europe in recent weeks - although there are signs that the surge in cases is beginning to slow down.\nThe number of people in hospital and intensive care units has also been steadily rising, with health professionals warning that that NHS is coming under increasing strain.\nMr Swinney said Scotland was in a \"fragile position\" with Covid-19 case rates still high, telling MSPs that \"we all recognise the need to try all we can to protect the return to greater normality that we have experienced in recent weeks\".\nHe said the scheme would reduce the risk of transmission in some settings, allowing those venues to \"operate more safely when the potential alternative would be closure\".\nMr Swinney said it would also protect vulnerable people who cannot be vaccinated, and would encourage others to come forward for a jab.\nHe said: \"On balance - given the benefits to individuals, to the health of the population, and as a way to keep certain venues and events open - a certification scheme is a proportionate step to take.\"\nMr Swinney had been critical of vaccine passports when the proposals for England were unveiled by the prime minister, as had Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and the SNP's partners in government, the Scottish Greens.\nGreens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the facts on the ground had changed - and that the scheme was \"worth considering when cases are running at around 7,000 a day and once the entire adult population has had two doses\".\nHospitality groups have called for more details about how the system will work, while a football supporters association said it was \"concerned about inequalities\" shutting some fans out of games.\nLeon Thompson of the trade body UK Hospitality Scotland told BBC Scotland there had been \"very rushed and hurried conversations with officials\" in recent days, with members \"very concerned\" about the practicalities of the plans.\nDr Liz Cameron, chief executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said it would \"directly impact on consumer confidence and risks creating further financial damage to those sectors who have already been hardest hit by Covid-19\".\nCBI Scotland director Tracy Black said vaccine passports had the potential to be \"a useful tool in managing risk in large venues\" - but that there needed to be \"close cooperation and coordination\" with businesses.\nThe Scottish Tories voted against the proposals despite the Conservative UK government planning to introduce a similar system.\nLeader Douglas Ross said not enough detail had been provided about the Scottish scheme, and that the government should not be asking MSPs to \"impose\" a vaccine certification scheme on establishments it was not able to define.\nHe said: \"A responsible government should bring forward proposals that are able to be enacted.\n\"We are in a really difficult position as politicians seeking to make a decision on an extremely difficult subject if the government cannot even give us simple information.\"\nScottish Labour also opposed the plans, with deputy leader Jackie Baillie saying there was a \"practical question about the government's ability to even implement this\".\nShe said people with a vaccination certificate could still have the virus and be infectious, saying ministers were in danger of giving people a false sense of confidence that they were \"invincible\".\nMs Baillie said the government should \"not simply reach for anything just to be seen to take action, and end up making things worse\".\nAnd Alex Cole-Hamilton said his Scottish Liberal Democrats were \"fundamentally opposed to the plans, which he said set the country on a \"disturbing and illiberal course\".\nHe added: \"Medical ID cards will be introduced by this coalition tonight and liberals will immediately begin the campaign to see their abolition.\""

      "tags": "Pride,LGBT,Lady Gaga,Music",
      "text": "Archbishop Carl Bean, a former Motown singer best known for the 1977 gay liberation anthem I Was Born This Way, has died at the age of 77.\nFeaturing the lyrics \"I'm happy, I'm carefree, and I'm gay, I was born this way\", it was a disco hit in the US and inspired Lady Gaga's Born This Way.\nShe credited him as an inspiration, saying his song was \"like a sermon\".\nAt the height of his music career, Bean worked with Dionne Warwick, Sammy Davis Jr, Burt Bacharach and Miles Davis.\nBut he turned down the offer of more work at Motown when they asked him to sing more commercially-viable love songs about women. \nInstead, he went on to become an Aids activist and founded a network of LGBT churches.\n\"Archbishop Bean worked tirelessly for the liberation of the underserved and for LGBTQ people of faith and in doing so, helped many around the world find their way back to spirituality and religion,\" the Unity Fellowship Church Movement said in a statement.\nIt said he had made the \"transition to eternal life\" on 7 September \"after a lengthy illness\".\nBorn in Baltimore in 1944, Bean was raised by his next-door neighbours after his mother died during an abortion. \nHe was actively involved in the church and the black civil rights movement from a young age, with the two often intertwining.\n\"I was introduced to Jesus as a rabble rouser who made things happen,\" he later recalled. The image of Jesus as an outsider, who embraced people from all walks of life, inspired him and taught him an early lesson about acceptance.\nAs a teenager, he found himself attracted to boys in the neighbourhood, and also alleged that an \"uncle\" - the brother of one of his guardians - sexually abused him.\nBoth revelations emerged at the same time and, in the ensuing turmoil, the family kicked him out.\n\"Being basically a foster child, I felt like, now I'ma be kicked out because I'm a queer,\" he told Vice in 2016. \"I attempted suicide and landed in the mental health ward of a big hospital.\"\nThe hospital insisted on treating him with electroshock therapy, but Bean found an ally in a German psychiatrist who helped him come to terms with his sexuality.\n\"She said, 'There are many people like you. I can't do what your parents want - make you a heterosexual - but I can help you accept who you are and go for your dreams,'\" he recalled.\n\"That gave me enlightenment and the chance to accept myself. If I had another doctor, I might have been a different animal.\"\nMusic was a solace for Bean and, after being released from hospital, he started performing gospel songs around Baltimore.\nAt 16, he moved to New York, where he became involved in the rich culture of the Harlem churches, and appeared in an early production of Langston Hughes's influential show Black Nativity.\nAfter another move to Los Angeles, he formed the group Carl Bean and Universal Love. But the band faltered because, in his words, they were too far \"ahead of the curve\".\n\"I was part of a movement looking to erase the line between R&B and gospel,\" Bean later explained in his autobiography.\nHowever, the band's 1974 single Gotta Be Some Change caught the ears of producers at Motown Records, who asked him to record a song written by Bunny Jones, I Was Born This Way.\nLabel owner Berry Gordy thought Bean \"would be perfect\" for the track, sister and fellow Motown executive Gwen Gordy later recalled. \"It's a message song with a gospel feel. [Berry said] Bean will tear it up.\" \nAlthough the lyrics were unconventional at the time - arriving before the Village People made an explicit connection between disco and homosexuality - Bean felt the song was a perfect fit.\n\"I always say the lyric found me, and it was very natural,\" he told US radio station NPR in 2019.\nAlthough the song had already been released a year earlier by recording artist Valentino, Bean's version became the definitive take, reaching number 15 on the US dance charts in 1978.\nAfter turning down a Motown career, he turned his attention back to the church and was ordained in 1982. That year, he also founded the Unity Fellowship of Christ Church for black LGBT congregants, whose motto is: \"God is love and love is for everyone.\"\nBefore long, he was asked to help establish similar congregations around the US and Caribbean.\n\"I told them, 'If you can get 10 black gay men and lesbians together, who aren't afraid to be out, I will come and talk.' So I went to many cities for many years, and only went back to LA around 1995,\" he told Out Alliance.\nBean also founded the Minority Aids Project in 1985, which was the first community organisation to focus on the spread of Aids in the black community at a time when the disease was relatively new and misunderstood.\nHe was honoured many times for his work, receiving an NAACP Image Award in 1987, and having an intersection in Los Angeles named in his honour two years ago. \nI Was Born This Way remained an important anthem for the gay community and gained a new lease of life in 2011 when Lady Gaga used it as the foundation for her own hymn to acceptance, Born This Way.\n\"I heard this song. And I just said, 'Man, does that answer every question'.\" the star once told radio host Howard Stern.\nBean said he was honoured and flattered that Gaga had referenced his biggest hit.\n\"I felt it was a great tribute, and it was the continuation of saving lives,\" he said. \n\"So you know, [I Was Born This Way] has just been a blessing to my life. And it's been a blessing, once again, to even another generation's life through the take that Gaga did on it.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A museum commemorating the deadly 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown has been raided by Hong Kong police.\nOfficers were later seen carrying exhibits out of the June 4 Museum.\nFour members of the group that ran the museum, the Hong Kong Alliance, were detained on Wednesday - including prominent pro-democracy activist and barrister Chow Hang Tung.\nThe arrests were made under the national security law, which has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\nPolice have accused Ms Chow of inciting subversion, her lawyers said.\nThe group, known for organising the city's famed annual vigil for Tiananmen Square victims, denies accusations of being a foreign agent.\nThe museum was closed down by officials in June. Thursday's raid was carried out by the newly created national security unit.\nAmong the exhibits seen being removed was a paper model of the Goddess of Democracy - a symbol of the 1989 pro-democracy student movement in Beijing.\nOfficers were also seen carrying out photos of the large candlelit vigils for Tiananmen victims.\nThe national security unit had earlier requested that the Hong Kong Alliance hand over information, reportedly including personal details of all members since the group's founding and financial records.\nOn Tuesday, the deadline for the request, the alliance members handed over a letter explaining their refusal to co-operate.\nThe next morning, police officers arrested members of the alliance's standing committee at their homes or offices.\nMs Chow, a human rights lawyer, was arrested earlier this year and charged with promoting unauthorised assembly. She was later released on bail.\nShe had been due on Wednesday to represent an opposition politician charged under the national security law at a bail hearing but was arrested at her office before she could appear in court.\nChina recently imposed a broadly worded national security law in Hong Kong that criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.\nCritics say it is aimed at crushing dissent but China says it is meant to maintain stability."

      "tags": "Gender pay gap,Employment,Employment discrimination,LGBT",
      "text": "The UK's first LGBT business champion has pledged to build a bridge between the government and the LGBT community.\nIain Anderson, executive chairman of public relations firm Cicero, will focus on improving workplace equality at a small business level.\nOne CIPD report suggested 40% of LGB employees had experienced conflict at work, rising to 55% of trans employees.\nEarlier this year, the government's LGBT advisory panel was disbanded after several members quit.\nOne, Jayne Ozanne, accused the government of creating a \"hostile environment\" for LGBT people.\nThe members left over the government's handling of LGBT rights and amid claims it was \"dragging its feet\" on a pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.\n\"I definitely see my role as a link between the LGBT community, government and business and I want to build a bridge between the three parties,\" Mr Anderson said. \n\"If businesses see me, and in turn government, putting in place tangible ways to allow LGBT people to be themselves, they'll understand that this is a priority area and do more about it.\"  \nMr Anderson, a Stonewall ambassador, was appointed to the new unpaid position by equalities minister Liz Truss. \nHe told the BBC that the UK had \"come a long way\" on LGBT issues, but there was \"still a lot of prejudice and discrimination out there\".\nHe added that large firms had put in a lot of work on improving conditions for LGBT workers and he wanted to help small firms \"buddy up\" with bigger companies to learn from their experiences.\n\"I don't want this to be a burden, I want this to be an opportunity,\" he added.\nStonewall's Robbie de Santos described the appointment as a \"really important move\" and said it was the government's responsibility to \"set the tone and culture\" for what was happening in the UK. \n\"Where 35% of LGBT+ people hide who they are at work for fear of discrimination - and two in five haven't told anyone about being bi at work - we are in a situation where the government does need to step in. \n\"It's just not on that huge sections of the LGBT population can have that experience at work, so it's a welcome sign the government has appointed someone specifically to look at this. If you think about how much of time we spend at work, it's really key.\" \nFor his part, Mr Anderson said that coming out as gay at work helped his business to thrive.\n\"I've been in business 30 years and I didn't feel able to be myself at work for about half that time,\" he said.\nLGBT people faced an average pay gap of 16% compared to heterosexual people, a 2019 YouGov survey for LinkedIn suggested - roughly double the UK's gender pay gap. \nWhile gender pay gap reporting has become compulsory for large businesses - suspended during the pandemic - Mr Anderson is not pushing for mandatory reporting of LGBT pay gaps.   \n\"I'm open to conversations with businesses and organisations about any suggestions they have to improve the workplace for LGBT people. If pay gap reporting is one of those suggestions, then I'm more than happy to look at this as an option.\"\nHe also acknowledges that LGBT pay gap reporting is more \"tricky\" as not all employees wish to be out at work.\nIn the role, he will also help British businesses to advocate LGBT equality in their international trading partners ahead of the UK's first global LGBT conference next summer.\nMike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Business (FSB), welcomed Mr Anderson's appointment.\n\"We hope this will instil a new clear focus on LGBT+ individuals who run small businesses right across the country who are so often overlooked compared to others. \n\"All too often, it is only larger companies and corporates that offered serious engagement with these issues, it's vital that small business owners and the self-employed are also considered and involved.\n\"The government must lead the way on this, by offering mentoring opportunities, role models and an expanded business network\".\nMatthew Percival, skills and inclusion director at the Confederation of British Industry said: \"Employers need to be thinking about all groups of society, taking steps to understand and respond to the experiences of LGBT employees. \n\"Forums or networks that help LGBT colleagues put forward their views and priorities to management are one of many practical ways in which this can be done.\" \nHe added that the government could \"send a powerful signal\" by ratifying the International Labour Organization's  Violence and Harassment Convention, described as the first international treaty to recognise the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment.\nJose Franca, who runs an LGBT business group, urged the government not to make the role a \"tick-box\" exercise.\n\"We feel that small business LGBT+ members aren't being represented and we say to the government, don't use us as tick-box exercise, engage with us - what are our challenges? Give us the spotlight,\" says Mr Franca, a developmental consultant who helps lead an LGBTQ+ support group for the FSB.\n\"Is this going to be different or is it just another PR exercise - what action will they take?\""

      "text": "The number of people on furlough has continued to fall, with young people leading the way, latest figures show.\nAt the end of July, 1.6 million people were still on furlough, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier.\nBut older people and the travel sector did less well, with half of eligible travel workers still on the scheme.\nThe Resolution Foundation said the numbers of people coming off furlough had \"slowed to a trickle\".\nSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, 11.6 million workers have benefited from the government programme, which is due to be wound up at the end of this month.\nAt the peak of the pandemic in May last year, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nThere had been \"a striking fall\" in the number of young people on furlough, the Treasury said.\nA total of 121,600 people aged 18 to 34 came off the scheme during the months of June and July, it added.\nThe number of people on furlough in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, as well as accommodation and food services have seen particularly large reductions in the number of jobs on furlough, the Treasury said.\nNumbers furloughed from these sectors declined by 26,200 and 96,700 in July respectively.\nHowever, concern remains over the number of people in the travel industry who are still on furlough.\nAccording to the Treasury figures, 51% of people employed in passenger air transport and 41% of travel agency and tour operator workers are still on furlough.\nLast month, British Airways warned it was facing a \"serious\" problem over wage costs, which would \"steeply increase\" after the end of the furlough scheme.\nOlder people are also more likely to be still on furlough. Those aged 65 and over had the highest rate of furlough, at 8%.\n\"As the end of the furlough scheme looms into view, men, older people and travel sector workers are particularly at risk,\" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nShe described the rates of furlough in the travel industry as \"alarmingly high\", adding: \"Where an entire industry is struggling, it's going to make life even harder if the end of furlough means you lose your job. \n\"There just aren't going to be enough travel industry jobs around, so an awful lot of people will have to move industry.\"\nAt the same time, latest figures for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) have shown a consistent fall in demand, with about 800,000 people claiming the most recent grant.\nAcross all five grants available under SEISS, 9.9 million claims have been made and more than \u00a327bn has been claimed by almost three million people.\nCharlie McCurdy, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the number of people coming off furlough over the summer had \"slowed to a trickle\".\n\"As a result, up to a million employees could still be on furlough when the scheme closes at the end of this month,\" he added.\n\"While we expect most of these staff to return to their previous roles, a significant number will not, and we could see a fresh rise in unemployment this autumn.\n\"Given these circumstances, now is not the right time to cut Universal Credit by \u00a320 a week. The government must change course.\" \nAre you currently on furlough?

      "text": "A sex attacker who throttled and raped a university student was so scared he had killed his victim that he checked her pulse, a court has heard. \nDillon Anderson, 22, was found guilty of raping four young women in a series of attacks between May 2014 and January 2020, the first when he was just 14. \nThe High Court in Edinburgh heard how Anderson throttled two of his victims during the assaults. \nAnderson denied any wrongdoing and claimed he had consensual sex. \nOne of his victims, a former Edinburgh University student, told how Anderson repeatedly caused her to pass out after compressing her neck. \nDescribing one occasion, the woman - now 23 - told police: \"When I came round, he was checking my pulse and he said, 'I thought you had died'. He looked panicked.\"\nJurors heard how Anderson, a former resident of Edinburgh's New Town area, wanted the woman to take part in \"rape\" role plays where she would be unconscious and he could do \"whatever he wanted\". \nDuring the trial Anderson claimed he was a virgin when he physically restrained a girl, who was then aged 14, at a house in Newtongrange, Midlothian. \nThe court heard how he forced her to lie on a bed and removed her clothing before raping her on an occasion between May 2014 and June 2014 .\nOn various occasions from August 2015, at addresses in Edinburgh and West Lothian, Anderson raped another girl who was aged 18. \nHe then repeatedly raped the Edinburgh University student - who was aged 19 - between September 2017 and December 2017. \nAnderson also preyed on another woman between December 2018 and January 2020.  The court heard how he also throttled this woman, now aged 24, before raping her. \nThe defendant was finally brought to justice after one of the women, none of whom can be named for legal reasons, made a covert recording of Anderson attacking her. \nAnderson was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow on 6 October.

      "text": "A former student has been jailed for 20 months for hacking university computers and selling exam answers for thousands of pounds.\nHayder Aljayyash, 29, was studying for a master's degree in embedded system design at the University of South Wales when he broke into its systems.\nAljayyash's crimes were committed between November 2017 and May 2019.\nCardiff Crown Court heard Aljayyash, from Iraq, remained undetected by using \"sophisticated\" techniques.\nIt was told he recruited housemate and fellow student Noureldien Eltarki, 30, to find students to buy the papers. \nEltarki, from Libya, was given a nine-month suspended sentence for agreeing to sell unlawfully obtained exams and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work.\nBoth men pleaded guilty to their charges at a previous hearing. \nThe system breach was discovered by maths lecturer, Liam Harris, while marking an exam in May 2019.\nJim Davis, prosecuting, said it became obvious to Mr Harris a number of students had answered questions by copying his own marking scheme and solutions.\nFive students had even copied typing mistakes from Mr Harris's original working papers.\nA team was then set up within the university to investigate and determine the size of the data breach.\nCardiff Crown Court heard the university established a \"war room\" to process 140 million log records, which identified an IP address - linked to a house in Brook Street, Treforest, where Aljayyash and Eltarki were both living - from which the systems were accessed. \nBoth men studied at the university's engineering and computer sciences faculty.\nPolice were informed of what had happened and arrested Aljayyash at home on 30 May 2019.\nMr Davis told the court police seized computer equipment belonging to Aljayyash, including USB sticks and a laptop which contained \"numerous files which matched those downloaded as part of the university breach\".\nThe court heard the defendant used staff log-in details to access the network almost 700 times. \nMr Davis said Aljayyash used \"a sophisticated key logging device to acquire details of staff usernames and passwords\".\nThe court heard Aljayyash made about \u00a320,000, including \u00a36,500 from one second-year student. \nEltarki was paid \u00a3300 or \u00a3400 each time by Aljayyash for finding students to buy the stolen papers.\nThe court heard the investigation and new security measures cost the university more than \u00a3100,000.\nSentencing Aljayyash, Judge Wynn Morgan told the defendant had \"obvious talent and skill,\" and what he did was \"planned and consistent\". \nHe called the scheme \"very sophisticated\" and said it had \"damaged the reputation of the institution\".\nHe told Aljayyash that his motive was \"financial greed\".\nThe court heard Aljayyash accepted responsibility for what he did and was \"ashamed\" of his actions.\nThe court was told he has moved to Doncaster, where he was volunteering at a charity shop fixing laptops and helping other asylum seekers to use technology.\nThe court heard he was \"intent on helping people use the internet for good\".\nSusan Ferrier, who defended Eltarki, told the court her client realised he had made as \"stupid a decision as he could have\".\nJudge Wynn Morgan told Eltarki the \"scheme was evidently not your idea but you attempted making money on the side which is self-evidently wrong\".\nAfter the case, South Wales Police's Det Con Marc Troake said: \"Through collaborative and intensive investigation involving South Wales Police and IT teams at the University of South Wales, we were able to trace these individuals who believed they could cheat the system. \n\"I hope that this sentence serves as a warning to those thinking about attempting to overcome security protocols for financial gain.\""

      "tags": "UK immigration,France,English Channel,Priti Patel,Migration",
      "text": "Boats carrying migrants across the English Channel could be turned back from the UK, if personally approved by Home Secretary Priti Patel. \nThe government has authorised Border Force officials to use the new tactic - but only in limited circumstances. \nHowever France is strongly against the plan, saying it breaks maritime law and accusing the UK of blackmail.\nBut Boris Johnson's spokesman said any plans would be \"safe and legal\" and would comply with the law.\nRising numbers of migrants have been crossing the English Channel in recent months - and so far this week more than 1,500 people have crossed by boat.\nThe Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities.\nGovernment sources have confirmed to the BBC that a Border Force team has been training for months to begin the operation.\nIt is understood that the final training may take place within days, subject to the weather - meaning the tactic would then be ready to be used whenever is it practical and safe to do so. \nBut France says the move flouts international maritime law, which says people at risk of losing their lives at sea must be rescued.\nFrance's interior minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin - who met Ms Patel on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - also accused the UK of financial blackmail.\nHe was referring to a deal the UK and France struck over money earlier this year, when the UK promised to pay France \u00a354.2m for extra action such as doubling the number of coast patrols. Since then, Ms Patel has warned that Britain could withhold the money, unless more boats are intercepted.\n\"UK's commitment must be kept,\" said Mr Darmanin. \"I clearly said it to my counterpart Priti Patel. The friendship between our two countries deserves better than posturing which undermines the cooperation between our ministries\".\nThe government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be. \nBecause the legal and safety risks are so high, it is also understood that Border Force chiefs have asked Ms Patel to personally support decisions to use the tactic, meaning she would have to be available to take a call from a Border Force vessel if and when they believe the tactic can be used safely.\nThe UK has a legal right to intercept people at sea where necessary to prevent crime or to protect borders.  \nBut whatever the legal advice the UK government has received on migrant boats, it's questionable whether such an operation could continue once there is a clear sign of danger. \nBorder Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. \nSo their window of opportunity to run a push-back operation could be very tight. \nBut more importantly\u2026 is this really ever going to happen? \nThe intervention from the French interior minister may have just sunk the operation before a single Border Force ship has set sail. \nThere are no international waters in the Dover Strait - so any operation would need French cooperation. \nAnd Gerald Darmanin's statement makes clear France's opposition to any confrontation of dinghies in one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes.\nThe tactic has never been used before in the English Channel, but it has been in the Mediterranean, said the Immigration Services Union (ISU) which represents borders, immigration and customs staff.\nLucy Moreton from the ISU said she would be \"very surprised\" if it ends up being used at all - calling it \"dead in the water\".\n\"There are understandably a lot of constraints around it, and you cannot do this with a vessel which is in any way vulnerable.\n\"But more importantly, you also need the consent of the French to do it. Because as you turn the vessel back towards France, when it crosses the median line it has to be intercepted and rescued by the French, and it appears the French will simply not engage in this.\"\nMs Patel met Mr Darmanin, on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - but the two sides failed to agree any new measures. \nMore than 12,600 migrants have made the journey across the English Channel so far this year.\nCharities urged the Home Office to take a \"more humane and responsible approach\" towards asylum seekers.\nAmnesty International UK has said people have the right to seek asylum in the UK and \"only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them\".\nAnd the head of the Refugee Council said: \"Rather than spending time, resource and immense effort on pushing these very vulnerable people away, this government must give people options for safe routes to stop such perilous journeys in the first place. \n\"Refugee family reunion is one such safe route that has saved thousands of lives. Resettlement is another. We urge this government to rethink its brutal policy and think about the individual lives at the heart of these desperate journeys.\"\nLabour also said the tactic risks lives, adding: \"That the home secretary is even considering these dangerous proposals shows how badly she has lost control of this situation.\"\nThe Home Office said it continues to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options to find ways of stopping small boats making the journey.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said the same, and that the UK's activities \"comply with international and domestic law\".\nAnd the government added that it needs to use every possible tactic at its\u00a0disposal to tackle people smuggling.\nMs Patel has repeatedly spoken out about organised crime gangs who smuggle people to the UK for profit - and that the new Nationality and Borders Bill aims to \"break their business model\".\nShe will host the final day of the G7 interior ministers meeting on Thursday, with illegal migration anticipated to be the focus."

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "With the vaccination programme racing against the spread of new variants, rules around international travel are rapidly changing.\nAlthough different countries have their own entry rules, a digital \"passport\" which provides evidence of a person's vaccination status has been rolled out across Europe.\nSimilar apps have been rolled out in the UK and while Scots have had to request theirs by post, Nicola Sturgeon has announced a QR system will be launched on Friday.\nPeople in Scotland have been able to access their certificate since 19 May - which shows both the dates of Covid vaccination and the type of drug administered.\nThe Scottish government said the service was intended to allow people access to a certificate without asking their GP, thereby \"easing the burden\" on the NHS.\nWhile no countries required vaccination status to travel when the service launched, some countries now do - and destinations have different entry rules which can change at short notice.\nThe government has information which you can check before travelling.\nMore than 30 countries, including Greece and Spain, now accept the pass.\nOriginally people could download the document online, but on 22 May the site suffered a security glitch which enabled people to alter details on the document using popular software programmes.\nBBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters.\nA fix was implemented on 25 May, which meant people in Scotland could only request the document be sent to them by post.\nPeople can view their vaccine status through the NHS Inform patient portal. Users have to log in using a unique username printed on their Covid vaccination appointment letter.\nThose who are not online can request the certificate to be posted by phoning a freephone Covid status helpline on 0808 196 8565.\nScotland's reliance on a paper system was previously criticised by travel agents, who said travellers were being \"blindsided\". \nConcerns emerged that the paper system was causing airport queues and more interactions with staff and passengers.\nBy the end of July, the Scottish government had awarded a Danish firm a \u00a3600,000 contract to develop a vaccine passport similar to those already in use elsewhere in the UK and Europe.\nOn Tuesday during a Covid update to Parliament, Ms Sturgeon confirmed people could download their certificate in the form of a QR code from Friday.\nPaper copies will continue but will include a QR code on them.\nFurthermore, vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month.\nMs Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review.\nAnd there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services.\nAn EU vaccine \"passport\" has been introduced across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\nBecause the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons, which has led to a number of problems.\nThe European system often requires people to present a QR code, however people in Scotland have been denied entry to certain places when they presented their paper certificate.\nFrance insists UK visitors are fully vaccinated before entry for non-essential travel. The country has also tightened its rules for any UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring them to have a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously.\nThe country has also rolled out a new health pass which means people need proof of vaccination to enter places such as museums and cinemas.\nMeanwhile Norway initially only accepted Norwegian, Danish, Swedish or EU digital Covid certificates as proof of vaccination or previous illness.\nFrom 12 August it began to accept certificates from England and Wales as it was able to verify QR codes at the border.\nAgain this has caused problems for people in Scotland - including one man whose yacht has been stranded in Norway since last August.\nPeople in England can use the NHS app to either download their certificate or have it emailed to them. \nSimilar systems are in place in Wales and Northern Ireland, and while the NI system went offline following a data breach in early August, it is now up and running again.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans \"to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather\" by the end of September.\nUnder these new measures, people would show proof of vaccination by using the NHS Covid Pass app in England."

Everything is going up.\"\nDirector of Infrastructure with the Consumer Council Peter McClenaghan said: \"The size of the Firmus energy price increase will shock consumers, make household budgeting more challenging, and is particularly difficult as consumers have no option to switch supplier.\n\"This Firmus energy increase follows rises in electricity, grocery, and fuel costs and is particularly bad news for consumers in vulnerable situations as it will coincide with the end of the furlough scheme, the removal of the Universal Credit uplift, and the start of winter,\" he added\nFirmus energy is regulated by the Utility Regulator and comes after SSE Airtricity put prices up last week."

      "text": "Dozens of women in Kabul and the north-eastern Afghan province of Badakhshan have protested against the formation of an all-male interim Taliban government to rule Afghanistan.\nDemonstrators said they would not accept a government with no women ministers.\nSome women were reportedly beaten before the protests were dispersed.\nLocal news organisation Etilaatroz said some of its journalists were detained and beaten for covering the rally.\nThe Taliban, who have not responded to the allegations, warned that such protests were illegal.\nThey have said protesters needed permission to march, and should not use what they called abusive language.\nOn Tuesday, three people were killed during a demonstration in the western city of Herat. \nThe EU said the Islamist group had reneged on promises to make their government \"inclusive and representative\", while the US also expressed concern that the interim government includes figures linked to attacks on US forces.\nAddressing reporters after a virtual meeting of 20 Western nations on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Taliban's government \"certainly does not meet the test of inclusivity, and it includes people who have very challenging track records\".\n\"The Taliban seek international legitimacy and support - any legitimacy, any support, will have to be earned,\" he said.\nBut China said on Wednesday that it welcomed the end of what it called \"three weeks of anarchy\" in Afghanistan, and pledged $31m (\u00a322m) in immediate aid.\nThe formation of an interim government, China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters, is \"a necessary step to restore order and rebuild the country\".\nThe anti-Taliban National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF) have urged the international community not to recognise the new government, calling the cabinet \"illegal\" and \"a clear sign of the group's enmity with the Afghan people\".\nThe NRF, led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of the late resistance icon Ahmad Shah Massoud, have been fighting Taliban militants in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, which was Afghanistan's last anti-Taliban stronghold.\nThe Taliban insist they have now defeated the NRF in Panjshir, but NRF leaders say they are still fighting.\nOn Tuesday the Taliban announced the first appointments to their interim cabinet, which will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund. \nHassan Akhund served as foreign minister, and then later deputy prime minister, when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Like many of the new cabinet ministers he is under UN sanctions for his position in that government.\nSpeaking to Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera on Wednesday, Hassan Akhund said former Afghan officials should return to the country and that their security and safety would be guaranteed.\nHe said Taliban leaders face great responsibility towards the Afghan people, adding: \"We have suffered heavy losses for this historical moment and the era of bloodshed in Afghanistan is over.\"\nAnother incoming minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is head of the notorious Haqqani network.\nThe Haqqani network has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) by the US. It also maintains close ties to al-Qaeda.\nThe FBI says Haqqani was behind some of the deadliest attacks of the 20-year-long war, including a truck bomb explosion in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people.\nHe is wanted by the FBI over a 2008 attack on a hotel that killed an American. \nThe Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in a sweeping offensive more than three weeks ago. They now face many tough challenges in the conflict-torn country, including stabilising the economy and gaining international recognition.\nEarlier on Tuesday, a statement attributed to Taliban Supreme Leader Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada told the government to uphold Sharia law - Islam's legal system. The Taliban have been known for their extremely hardline interpretation of Sharia.\nThe Taliban want \"strong and healthy\" relations with other countries and would respect international laws and treaties as long as they did not conflict with \"Islamic law and the country's national values\", the statement said.\nHassan Akhund, the new interim prime minister, is influential on the religious side of the movement, rather than the military side.\nHis appointment is seen as a compromise, after recent reports of in-fighting between some relatively moderate Taliban figures and their hardline colleagues.\nA movement which has long moved in the shadows, whose names would surface only on the world's terrorism watch lists, is now announcing titles used in governments the world over. \nActing prime minister Mullah Akhund appears as a compromise candidate after reported rivalries among leading military and political figures who will serve under him. \nIts caretaker nature also provides breathing space as the Taliban move from guns to government. \nIt also underlines the Taliban view that a Taliban victory can only mean Taliban rule. Sources say they pushed back against calls for an \"inclusive\" government. They balked at including former political figures and officials, who've had their turn at the top, and especially those tainted by corruption. \n\"Why should we let others pick our cabinet when other countries pick their own? \"was one retort. \nAs for women, there was never a chance they would be given a ministerial role; the ministry of women's affairs seems to have been, for now, abolished altogether.  \nOther appointments to the new government include:"

      "text": "Doctors have queried why the government did not plan for a delay to flu vaccine deliveries in England and Wales.\nSeqirus, one of the UK's largest suppliers of seasonal flu vaccines, has said the delay of up to two weeks is due to a shortage of HGV drivers.\nBritish Medical Association vice-chairman David Wrigley urged MPs to \"to take some action and say why are there were no contingency plans in place\". \nThe Department of Health said it was \"untrue\" to say there was a shortage. \n\"The delivery from one supplier is delayed by one or two weeks and this should have no impact on the flu vaccination programme overall,\" a spokesperson said. \nNHS England says patients who are affected will be contacted by their GP.\nDr Wrigley told BBC Breakfast his practice was expecting 5,500 flu vaccines to be delivered. \nHe said some members of staff were \"physically shaken\" at the news that all those appointments would have to be rescheduled.\nHe said: \"We know there's difficulties with HGV drivers so why are we not getting these flu jabs to the practices so we can get them into our patients' arms and protect them?    \"We're hearing nothing from our politicians and the BMA is actually calling for the government to have a Cobra meeting because within the space of two weeks we've seen two major crises of cancellation of blood tests and now flu jabs.\"\nSeqirus, which supplies vaccines to GP practices and pharmacies in England and Wales, said: \"Due to unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays, we have informed all our customers of a consequent delay to their scheduled vaccine delivery by a maximum of one to two weeks.\nThe company, which is one of a number of suppliers, said it was it was \"working hard to resolve the delay\" and customers would be able to reschedule their flu vaccination clinics.\nProfessor Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said there could be a surge in flu cases this year so delays to jabs were concerning.\nCoronavirus lockdowns meant flu levels had been very low last winter, he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"We do know when there are low circulating influenza levels the year before often we get high infection rates in the following year,\" he said.\n\"So it's quite possible that we will have a high instance of influenza this year.\"\nHe said it was important to get the flu jab \"as soon as possible\" and that he hoped the delay would be corrected soon.\nMeanwhile, the professional body representing GPs said it would hit practices.\n\"This is news we really didn't want to hear\", said Dr Gary Howsam, vice chairman of the Royal College of GPs.\n\"With more than 36 million people eligible for the flu vaccine on the NHS this year, GPs need the supply chain to run like clockwork.\nDr Howsam said GPs are \"already under enormous pressure and still waiting for details of how the Covid booster campaign will align with everything else they need to do this winter\".\nDoctors meticulously plan jabs each year, he said, adding that it is \"essential that as many people as possible in at-risk groups get their vaccination as early into the flu season as possible\".\n\"A delay of even a couple of weeks is going to have a big impact on practices and their patients, especially when GPs are already dealing with the fallout caused by the shortage of blood test bottles and the anxiety this is causing.\"\n\"General practice and the entire NHS is dependent on the smooth roll-out of the winter flu vaccination programme. It cannot fail,\" he said.\nDoctors are already dealing with a shortage of blood test tube vials due to supply chain issues.\nDr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said the delay is likely to affect a \"significant proportion\" of practices - and have a \"serious impact\" on practice workloads and patients.\nHe said: \"Many practices will have spent the last few days and weeks meticulously planning for their flu vaccination programme, inviting and booking patients in for their jabs, only now to have to contact them all again to cancel or reschedule appointments.\n\"This causes a huge increase in staff's already unsustainable workloads, and inconvenience and unneeded anxiety for patients who will be keen to be protected ahead of winter.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: \"GPs are at their wits' end, first forced to cancel blood tests because of bottle shortages and now we learn flu vaccines will be delayed.\n\"This has been a summer of crisis for the NHS with patients paying the price.\n\"With winter coming and flu resurgence a huge risk, ministers must urgently get a grip.\""

      "text": "At least 14 people have been killed in a fire at a makeshift hospital treating Covid-19 patients in North Macedonia. \nFootage shared on social media showed a building in flames and a thick cloud of black smoke billowing into the air near a main road in the city of Tetovo. \nFirefighters put out the blaze in less than an hour. It broke out about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday.\nThe authorities suspect that oxygen cylinders used to treat coronavirus patients exploded.\nPublic prosecutors said they were investigating whether there were more victims, as reported locally.\n\"This is a very sad day,\" Health Minister Venko Filipce wrote on Twitter, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims.\nOf the 26 patients in the coronavirus treatment facility at the time of the fire, 12 were being treated in hospital and were \"out of danger\", Mr Filipce said.\nHe described the fire as a \"terrible accident\" but provided no further details.\nTetovo's deputy fire chief Saso Trajcevski said the fire had spread rapidly inside the building after oxygen cylinders exploded. Footage showed flames bursting through the windows in the portable buildings that made up the modular hospital.\nAlthough his team reached the building quickly, he said the large amount of plastic meant that the fire was intense.\n\"This is a truly tragic event,\" said Prime Minister Zoran Zaev in a statement posted to Facebook, adding: \"The cause of the fire will be determined.\" \nLocal media said Mr Zaev had been booed when he arrived at the site of the accident on Thursday. \nNorth Macedonia's government has declared three days of national mourning for the victims.\nThe temporary facility was reportedly constructed last year to care for people made seriously ill from the coronavirus.\nOxygen cylinders have been blamed for a number of fires at hospitals treating coronavirus patients since the pandemic began. Ten people died in a fire at Gaziantep in Turkey last December, and a similar fire claimed 10 lives in Peatra Niamt in Romania in November 2020.\nNorth Macedonia has a population of about two million people and, with Covid vaccination rates below 30%, it has seen a recent surge in cases and deaths. Tetovo is one of the most affected areas, as many expat Macedonians are said to have visited friends and relatives there during the summer months.\nMayor Teuta Arifi spoke of her regret that the victims had been in the hospital for coronavirus treatment. The Republika website said most of the patients were in a moderate condition as the most serious cases had been transferred to the capital Skopje for treatment.\nOne infectious diseases specialist, Zaklina Sopova, complained that makeshift hospital facilities had been set up without proper safety standards.\nNorth Macedonia has reported more than 180,000 cases of Covid-19 and 6,153 coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. A further 24 deaths were reported over the past day on Wednesday."

      "text": "Care Minister Helen Whately has admitted that putting into effect the cap on social care costs is \"a little way off\" but said it is a \"big reform that takes time to implement\". \nMPs last night voted to approve a rise in National Insurance to help fund health and social care.\nIt limits care bills faced by people in England to \u00a386,000 from October 2023. \nBut critics say the system is in crisis now and most of the funding will be swallowed up by the NHS. \nMPs voted by 319 to 248 for a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance next year for both workers and employers, to help deal with the crisis in health and social care as the UK emerges from the pandemic. \nIn 2023, National Insurance will return to its previous level and the tax increase will become a separate health and social care levy on earnings.\nThe measures will raise an extra \u00a312bn a year over three years and the prime minister has said the majority of the \u00a336bn fund will go towards dealing with the waiting list backlog in the NHS which has reached a record high. \nAround 15% of the money - \u00a35.4bn in total - will go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that.\nBut there are fears that the demands on the money from the health service will continue, and not enough funding will be left to tackle the growing problems in social care. \nThe draft legislation for the new Health and Social Care Levy shows how the money raised will be legally ringfenced to be spent on health and social care, but gives the Treasury the power to decide the split.\nThis is likely to reinforce fears amongst MPs that the funds will be monopolised by the health service and never reach the care sector. \nIn the Commons on Wednesday, Conservative Jake Berry said he was \"very concerned that this tax is not really a health and social care tax, it's actually a Trojan horse for an NHS tax\".\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Whately denied it was a possibility that social care could lose out. \nShe said ministers had \"seized\" the challenge after successive government had talked for decades about overhauling the system but had failed to get reforms through.\nShe said some of the extra funding would start going in to social care from April 2022, but the new cap on costs, that ensures no-one in England will have to pay more than \u00a386,000 - not including food or accommodation - will not take effect until 18 months later.\nShe praised the measure, which only applies to new claimants from October 2023 and not those already in the system, as a way to give people \"peace of mind\". \nShe said: \"This big policy to put in place a cap on the amount that you might face for the cost of your care, that does simply take time to implement.\n\"We can't turn it on tomorrow.\n\"We will turn it on as soon as we can and that will then give people the peace of mind that they won't face those huge care bills that some face at the minute.\"\nLabour says the government has broken its promise that people will not have to sell their home in order to pay for the help they need. \nSpeaking in the debate on Tuesday evening, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said under Mr Johnson's plan \"someone with a house worth \u00a3186,000 would still have to pay \u00a386,000 even with this cap - and that's before living costs of going into a care home.\"\n\"How does the chancellor suggest they pay those fees without selling their home?\" she asked.\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

      "text": "The US Department of Justice has filed a civil lawsuit challenging Texas' controversial abortion law. \n\"The act is clearly unconstitutional,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a briefing on Thursday. \nIt bans abortions from as early as six weeks into pregnancy and allows anyone to sue those involved in the procedure.\nDoctors and women's rights groups have strongly condemned the law, which took effect last week after the Supreme Court failed to block it. \nSB8, also known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, came into effect last week after the Supreme Court did not respond to an emergency appeal filed by abortion providers. \nIn an unsigned opinion, the court said that although the appeals had raised \"serious questions\" about the constitutionality of the law, it could not block it due to complex and \"novel\" procedural questions.\nThe lawsuit says: \"It takes little imagination to discern Texas's goal - to make it too risky for an abortion clinic to operate in the State, thereby preventing women throughout Texas from exercising their constitutional rights, while simultaneously thwarting judicial review.\"\nAt the briefing, Mr Garland said a \"scheme to nullify the Constitution of the United States is one that all Americans, whatever their politics or party, should fear\".\nHe said the greater risk was that other states might follow Texas' example with regards to any such rights, warning that his department would then bring similar lawsuits against them.\nDemocratic President Joe Biden has been under increasing pressure to act after the law went into effect on 1 September. \nLast week, Mr Biden vowed a \"whole-of-government\" response. He called the Supreme Court's decision to not block the law \"an unprecedented assault\" on women's rights. \nEarlier this week, the justice department announced it would protect Texas clinics that performed abortions.\nSB8 bans abortions following the detection of what anti-abortion activists call a foetal heartbeat. \nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said the term is misleading and what is being detected at such an early stage of pregnancy is a portion of foetal tissue \"that will become the heart as the embryo develops\".\nThe law also gives individuals the right to sue anyone who provides or facilitates access to an abortion past the six-week point. It does not allow the women who get the procedure to be sued. \nPeople who successfully sue under the law will be awarded at least $10,000 (\u00a37,200), in addition to any legal fees incurred. \nCritics, like the American Civil Liberties Union, have said that this leaves the responsibility for enforcing it on individuals, rather than local or state officials, and could give rise to abortion \"bounty hunters\".\nTexas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott has defended the law, vowing that his state will \"always defend the right to life\".\nOfficials in several other US states have said they are considering similar laws. \nIn Florida, state Senate leader Wilton Simpson told reporters that the ban has \"encouraged\" local politicians, who are \"already working\" on a similar bill. South Dakota's governor Kristi Noem said she has directed her office's \"unborn child advocate\" to make sure the state has anti-abortion laws \"on the books\"."

I thought they were going to kill me.\" \nMr Naqdi was covering a protest by women in front of a police station with his colleague at the local Etilaatroz newspaper, Taqi Darybai. \nThe Taliban have banned protests unless authorised by the justice ministry. \nBut dozens of demonstrators chanting \"we want freedom\" gathered near the Pakistan embassy in Kabul and Taliban gunmen opened fire to disperse them, protesters said. \nLocal media have also reported another protest by women in Kapisa province, north-east of Kabul. Sources told Aamaj news that several women had been arrested. \nBBC Dari heard from a number of Afghans about the demonstrations.\n\"It is our right to protest,\" said Haseeneh from Kabul. \"Now that we know what the Taliban meant by their new cabinet, we will protest. They kept saying that women should wait till the Taliban announce their new cabinet. There is no single woman in the cabinet.\"\nBut Alazay from the southern province of Helmand called for other countries to recognise the Taliban government.\n\"If that happens, our lives are going to be much easier. If the protests continue and the Taliban suppress them, the international community will not recognise the Taliban's new government and do you know who will suffer? We, the people.\" \nOn Wednesday, dozens of women in Kabul and the north-eastern province of Badakhshan protested against the formation of the all-male interim Taliban government. \nSome women, calling for the inclusion of female ministers in the government, were reportedly beaten before the demonstrations were broken up.\nThree people were killed during a demonstration in the western city of Herat on Tuesday. The Taliban have denied that they were behind the violence.\nMeanwhile, there are reports that the internet was temporarily taken down in parts of Kabul. \nAfghan journalist Bilal Sarwary tweeted that several sources in the telecom sector had confirmed to him that the Taliban had ordered mobile phone internet coverage to be turned off temporarily in several districts. \nJournalist Habib Khan later tweeted that the internet had been restored in the city.\nAnd separately, social media footage has emerged from the Panjshir valley said to show the desecration of the mausoleum of the well-known former anti-Taliban alliance leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud. \nThe Taliban said on Tuesday they had taken the valley - the last region of Afghanistan holding out against their rule - from the Afghanistan National Resistance Front. The NRF, led by Ahmed Shah Massoud's son, said they would continue to fight. "

      "text": "An imposing statue of an American Confederate general in Richmond, Virginia, has been taken down.\nGovernor Ralph Northam announced it would come down amid national protests after the death of George Floyd.\nThe statue became a focal point for this activism and crowds cheered as a crane removed it on Wednesday.\nMemorials to leaders of the pro-slavery, Confederate states - whose capital was Richmond - have long stirred controversy.\nWhile the removal of these statues is often done with little fanfare, authorities broadcast Wednesday's removal on social media. Large crowds also gathered at the site.\nEarlier in the week, Mr Northam called the statue \"a monument to the Confederate insurrection\".\nThe 21ft (6.4m) statue - which dates to 1890 - was taken to a secure facility until a decision is made about what to do with it.\nThe statue's 40ft (12m) pedestal, which is still covered in graffiti from the 2020 protests, will remain in place. Local officials have said that it will stay there until the area is \"reimagined.\"  \nIn a moment fraught with symbolism, the statue of the leader of the Confederate Army has come down in the city that was once the capital of the Confederacy.\nFor many in the South - the white South - Lee was a hero and a rallying cry. For some, he was a symbol of regional pride. For others, he was an icon of resistance - first, to the occupying Union armies in the aftermath war, but later to attempts by the US federal government to impose desegregation and civil rights protections on recalcitrant Southern states.\nIt was no coincidence that most of the confederate statues were erected not in the immediate aftermath of the war, but in the early 20th Century, as the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan gained power and southern legislatures enacted Jim Crow laws disenfranchising blacks.\nLee's removal reflects the seismic shift in attitudes toward the Confederacy in much of the US South - especially Virginia, where changes in demographics and political perspectives have been particularly pronounced.\nNow the city must determine how to fill the empty lots and graffiti-covered pedestals where these statues once stood - fashioning a new history in place of the dismantled one.\nThe governor's plans to remove the statue in 2020 were delayed by two separate lawsuits by Richmond residents opposed to its removal.\nLast week, however, Virginia's Supreme Court rejected the lawsuits, paving the way for the statue to be removed.\n\"This is an important step in showing who we are and what we value as a Commonwealth,\" Governor Northam said.\nHundreds of statues of General Lee and other famous Confederate figures exist throughout the US.\n\"There's no other country in the world that erects monuments to those who took up arms against their country,\" Mayor of Richmond, Levar Stoney, told BBC News.\nSince a wave of protests engulfed the US following George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer, more than a dozen statues have been removed in Richmond alone.\nFormer President Donald Trump released a statement on Wednesday night decrying the \"complete desecration\" of the statue.\n\"Our culture is being destroyed,\" he wrote."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has announced sweeping new Covid-19 measures that require workers at large companies to be vaccinated or face weekly testing.\nThe measures also include a vaccine mandate for millions of federal government workers and come as cases in the country are surging.\nHospitals in several states have reached capacity amid the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant.\nThe new requirements cover about 100 million workers. \n\"This is not about freedom, or personal choice, it's about protecting yourself and those around you,\" the president said as he unveiled his plan. \nMore than 650,000 Americans have died with Covid-19 since last year. Some 80 million people in the US remain unvaccinated. \nMr Biden announced his plan in a speech at the White House on Thursday. \nHe said he had directed the US Department of Labor to require all private businesses with 100 or more staff to mandate the jab or request proof of a negative coronavirus test from employees at least once a week.\nNearly 17 million healthcare workers at facilities receiving federal benefits will also face the same requirements, he said. \nThe plan triggered an immediate backlash among some Republicans, who argued that the government should not play a role in the health decisions of individuals.\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said \"Biden and the radical Democrats [have] thumbed their noses at the Constitution\".\nThe time for sweet-talking, for cajoling Americans to take the Covid-19 vaccine is over. The time for government mandates has arrived.\nThat was the blunt message Joe Biden delivered to the nation on Thursday afternoon. While many Americans have received at least one jab, the president laid the blame for the continued US health crises squarely at the feet of the 25% of the public who are unvaccinated and the politicians who he said were \"actively working to undermine the fight\".\nMr Biden said his new vaccine orders were not about freedom or personal choice, but that's exactly how some Americans will view them - as a forced choice between vaccination and continued employment. And while the mandates will increase the number of vaccinated Americans, it will also enflame a debate already rife with political tension.\nIn July, Mr Biden gave an optimistic speech about how Americans soon would be declaring their \"independence\" from the virus. Because of the Delta variant, that independence day has failed to arrive. This, in turn, has taken a toll on the US economy and public perceptions of how the president is handling the pandemic. This is Mr Biden's bid to use government muscle to turn the tide.\nThe president's plan uses the full force of his executive power to mandate the jab for unvaccinated Americans.\nSome of his initiatives address common concerns of Americans who have yet to get the vaccine - such as not wanting to miss work to get the jab or recover from side effects. \nThe president said that requirements that large businesses provide paid time off for workers to get vaccinated will be unveiled in the coming weeks by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha).\nBusinesses that do not comply with the new rules may face thousands of dollars in fines per violation.\nA separate federal mandate, which the White House says will impact some 2.5 million government workers, supersedes Mr Biden's earlier order that permitted government employees to undergo regular testing if they did not wish to be vaccinated. Now workers that refuse the jab may be fired.\nOverall, the rule now requires that about two-thirds of all US workers be vaccinated. \nThousands of people - largely unvaccinated - are dying every week in the US with Covid-19. \nThe situation has dealt a blow to Mr Biden's hopes that a successful pandemic response would bolster support for the Democratic president.\nOther rules that Mr Biden directed include:\nDespite the Delta-fuelled surge, deaths are still down in most places from the levels seen last winter. However, some regions with relatively low jab rates have recently recorded record high infection rates.\n\"The path ahead, even with the Delta variant, is not nearly as bad as last winter,\" Mr Biden said in Thursday's address. \n\"What makes it incredibly frustrating is that a distinct minority of Americans are keeping us from turning the corner.\"\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 64% of American adults are fully vaccinated. More than 75% have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. \nSeparately on Thursday, education officials in Los Angeles voted to require students aged 12 and above to be vaccinated in order to attend school by January - unless they have a medical or other exemption. \nThe measure is likely to be challenged in the courts."

      "text": "Three is the latest mobile network to announce it is reintroducing roaming charges between the UK and Europe. \nFrom 23 May 2022, customers who have taken out a new or upgraded contract after 1 October will have to pay \u00a32 a day to use their monthly allowance of minutes, texts and data in the EU. \nIt follows similar announcements from EE and Vodafone earlier this year. \nThree is also extending changes to other destinations, introducing a \u00a35 a day charge for roaming outside Europe.\nThe move effectively ends Three's long-standing roaming feature, branded \"Go Roam\", which allowed customers to use their contract allowances in 71 countries, including distant locations such as the USA, Hong Kong and Australia.  \n\"This is a huge blow to Three customers,\" said Paolo Pescatore, a telecoms analyst at PP Foresight.\n\"Free roaming to so many destinations helped lure and retain users. Now this is no longer a differentiator, it will be hard for Three to stand out in an increasingly crowded and cut-throat market,\" he warned.\nIn a statement, Three said: \"The new charge ensures that customers are clear on what they will pay when using their phone in another country and only those who roam will pay for the service.\n\"It will also ensure that we can continue investing in our UK network.\" \nThe change does not affect roaming to Ireland or in the Isle of Man. \nMobile operators have also said they are under pressure from rising costs, including wholesale costs which can be much higher for UK networks. \nUnder EU rules, citizens could use their contract's minutes, texts, and data while roaming in the EU. But that is no longer the case post-Brexit as the trade deal did not include it. \nUK law does, however, cap roaming charges at \u00a345 per month, unless the user explicitly decides to spend more. \nAll major UK operators had previously said they had no plans to reintroduce roaming fees in Europe. \nEE was the first to break ranks and announce that it would do so, followed by Vodafone. \nO2 said there is currently no change in its stated position - that it has no plans to change roaming fees.\nIn a statement, Sky Mobile said: \"Customers will not be charged roaming charges in EU countries and will be able to continue to use their data, call and text allowances as they do in the UK.\" "

      "text": "Compulsory Covid and flu jabs for frontline NHS and care workers in England are being considered in a government consultation.\nPlans are already in place to make it mandatory for care home workers in England to be fully vaccinated.\nBut some unions and care organisations have warned that making the jabs mandatory will lead to staff shortages.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid is urging all health service workers to get both jabs to protect vulnerable patients.\nAbout 88% of NHS trust staff have received two Covid doses, but in some trusts that falls to 78%, figures show.\nIn the UK, more than 30,000 new daily cases have been reported for nine days in a row and the number of people in hospital with the disease is rising.\nThe six-week consultation process will take views on whether vaccine requirements should apply for health and wider social care workers - those in contact with patients and people receiving care.\nThose working in care homes in England regulated by the Care Quality Commission need to be double jabbed, unless medically exempt, from November.\nThese latest proposals, if agreed, would extend that to all health service workers and would mean that only those who are fully vaccinated - unless exempt - would be able to be deployed to deliver health and care services.\nCare organisations have warned compulsory vaccinations could cause difficulties in a sector that already struggles with recruitment.\nSocial care minister Helen Whately said about 90% of care home staff have already been vaccinated and the government was working with care homes to support staff who were hesitant about getting the jab.\nAsked if they would be sacked if they did not get vaccinated, she told BBC's Breakfast alterative roles would be sought for them outside the care home, adding: \"This is really difficult.\"\nShe said she had spoken to care home residents and their families who said they wanted workers double vaccinated to give them the most protection against Covid.\nViews from government advisory bodies on the plans are mixed.\nThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) Social Care Working Group advises a similar approach to vaccination across social care and health sectors, because the network of residents, patients and workers are so close and often overlap.\nWhile Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said if the proposals did go ahead, it would be \"like an admission of failure\" and imply that messaging was not effective enough.\n\"It's like saying you can't either find the time or find the ability to explain to people why it makes sense and create the culture in which everybody does it because they understand why it's important,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nThe consultation is expected to focus on the proposals, their scope, and any impact on staffing and safety such as reducing staff sickness absence.\nStaff, healthcare providers, patients and their families are all being urged to share their view with the government, with a final decision expected this winter.\nMr Javid said it was clear to see the impact vaccines had against respiratory viruses which could be fatal to the vulnerable.\n\"We will consider the responses to the consultation carefully but, whatever happens, I urge the small minority of NHS staff who have not yet been jabbed to consider getting vaccinated - for their own health as well as those around them,\" he said.\nThe government said there was a longstanding precedent for vaccination in NHS roles - some surgeons already have to have Hepatitis B jabs if they are likely to be exposed to the virus. \nNorthern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have not made Covid vaccines compulsory for care home staff.\nFlu vaccination has been recommended to vulnerable groups in the UK since the 1960s.\nNational flu jab rates in the health service have increased over the last decade, from 14% in 2002 to 76% last year. \nExperts are warning of a possible surge in flu cases this year as coronavirus lockdowns meant flu levels were very low last winter."

      "text": "Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it expects the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year.\nIt said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices.\nHowever, it said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability.\nTransport secretary Grant Shapps said the UK must \"stand on its own two feet\" and not rely on EU drivers.\nSpeaking after Morrisons reported its latest trading figures, Mr Shapps rejected calls for more immigration to resolve the problem. \n\"We have to stand on our own two feet as the United Kingdom. There are a lot of people coming off furlough. I look forward to them getting jobs.\" \nLorry driver shortages have have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.\nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000.\nMr Shapps said: \"To say this is an issue of Brexit is completely untrue. What it is about - is coronavirus.\" \nHe pointed to the global driver shortage in the US, Poland and Germany and said the UK was not alone in having supply chain problems. \nThe transport secretary confirmed that some HGV driver tests would be fast-tracked.\nMorrisons and its rivals have seen gaps on shelves due to the driver shortage.\nLast month, it joined a growing chorus in the food and drink industry calling for government help to recruit lorry drivers.\nChief executive David Potts indicated HGV drivers should be eligible for Skilled Worker visas, allowing them to work in the UK.\nThe firm's latest comments came as it reported first-half results, showing a profit before tax and exceptional items of \u00a3105m in the six months to 1 August, down from \u00a3167m in the same period last year.\nMorrisons is currently at the centre of a takeover battle between two US private equity firms.\nIn its results statement, it reiterated that it had received offers for the company from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) and Fortress and was recommending CD&R's offer of 285p per share.\nShareholders will be asked to approve this offer at a meeting to be held in or around the week beginning 18 October, it added.\nHowever, as neither bidder has said their offer is final, Morrisons said on Wednesday that it was in talks with CD&R, Fortress and the Takeover Panel about an auction to decide its future.\nIt said any auction would take place before the planned shareholder meetings, on a date to be announced by the Takeover Panel.\nMorrisons said the whole British food industry was facing continued challenges from Covid-19 and sustained supply chain cost increases, which were largely outside its control. \nHowever, it added that it was working to address those challenges and that second-half profit was expected to be considerably higher than in the first half. \nWe expect some industry-wide retail price inflation during the second half, driven by sustained recent commodity price increases and freight inflation, and the current shortage of HGV drivers,\" it said.\n\"We will seek to mitigate these and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred to maintain good on-shelf availability.\"\nChairman Andrew Higginson said the whole Morrisons team had shown \"commendable resilience facing into a variety of continuing challenges during the first half, including the ongoing pandemic, disruption at some of our partner suppliers and the impact on our supply chain of HGV driver shortages\".\n\"As we approach our busiest time of year, I'm confident the team will continue to rise to all challenges and keep up all the good work to improve the shopping trip for customers,\" he added.\nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Morrisons, like all supermarkets, had faced the challenge of maintaining customer interest and sales as non-essential retail reopened after the pandemic and life returned to some kind of normality.\n\"But those roadblocks haven't stopped the retailer from shining,\" she added. \"The ongoing bidding war for the UK's fourth-largest grocer has proved that a growing online presence often satisfies the appetite of hungry investors. \n\"Having cemented an important relationship as a key supplier and partner to Amazon, and to McColl's convenience stores, Morrisons has triggered a bidding war among private equity firms in the US, who are more concerned with the lucrative property portfolio which the store network possesses than what's on the shelves.\""

      "text": "Facebook has been accused of breaking equality law in the way it handles job adverts. \nCampaign group Global Witness said it failed to prevent discriminatory targeting of ads and its algorithm was biased in choosing who would see them.\nIn an experiment, almost all Facebook users shown adverts for mechanics were men, while ads for nursery nurses were seen almost exclusively by women.\nFacebook says its system shows people ads they may be most interested in.\nGlobal Witness submitted two job ads for approval, asking Facebook not to show:\nAnd the social-media giant approved both ads for publication, although it did ask the organisation to tick a box saying it would not discriminate against these groups.  \nGlobal Witness pulled the adverts before they were published.\nFacebook said: \"Our system takes into account different kinds of information to try and serve people ads they will be most interested in and we are reviewing the findings within this report.\"\nIn 2019, a legal case was brought in the US over house-related adverts on Facebook the US Department of Housing and Urban Development alleged discriminated on the basis of ethnicity.\nThe social network has since agreed it would not allow discriminatory ads of this kind in the United States and Canada.\nAnd it says it is exploring extending the limits on the targeting of job, housing and credit ads to other countries.\n\"The fact that it is possible to do this on Facebook in the UK is particularly shocking,\" Naomi Hirst, who led Global Witness's investigation, said.\nBut the campaign group is even more concerned by what it found out about how Facebook's system handled ads for which the recruiter did not specify a target audience. \nGlobal Witness created four job ads, linked to real vacancies on the indeed.com platform, for nursery nurses, pilots, mechanics and psychologists. \nThe group specified only the ads should be seen by UK adults. \n\"That meant that it was entirely up to Facebook's algorithm to decide who to show the ads to,\" Ms Hirst said, \"and what it decided appears to us to be downright sexist.\" \nOf the people shown an ad for:\nThe algorithm is designed to ensure as many people as possible click on the ads - but Global Witness says it is perpetuating and even amplifying biases already built into recruitment. \nPreviously, for example, jobs for mechanics may have been advertised in magazines aimed at men. \n\"The difference here,\" Ms Hirst said,  \"is that if you are a woman looking for a job as a mechanic, you could just as easily go to a shop and buy that magazine as your male peer. \n\"It's just simply not true online.\"\nGlobal Witness asked barrister Schona Jolly QC to examine its evidence.\nAnd in a submission to the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission, she wrote: \"Facebook's system itself may, and does appear to, lead to discriminatory outcomes.\"\nGlobal Witness has also contacted the information commissioner about what it describes as the discriminatory practices resulting from the way Facebook processes data for job adverts. \nRavi Naik, a data-rights lawyer acting for Global Witness, said its concern was Facebook's advertising mechanisms might lead to the social network's customers breaching equality laws.\n\"That is massively consequential because Facebook's entire business model is advertising and if that business model results in discriminatory practices, that undermines the ability of Facebook to operate properly in this country,\" he added."

      "text": "The Public Health Agency (PHA) is set to take over responsibility for the contact tracing of close contacts of Covid-19 cases in schools, BBC News NI understands.\nIf approved, the move is expected to reduce the number of pupils who have to self-isolate and miss time in school.\nIt is also expected to ease demand for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\nSchools will be urged to encourage pupils to take twice-weekly lateral flow device (LFD) tests.\nThe aim is also to ease the burden placed on principals and school leaders to trace close contacts.\nThe Ulster Teachers' Union said schools had faced a \"tsunami\" of Covid-19 cases and related absences in recent days.\nPrincipals' representatives and teaching unions are expected to be consulted on the plans later.\nThey are similar to arrangements for schools currently in place in England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe change will certainly improve things for school principals and senior school staff who have had to take on the bulk of contact tracing at the minute, when there has been a positive case. \nThey could contact the PHA for advice, but many principals reported it could take a while for them to get that advice. \nReally it has been down to principals and schools to do the bulk of contact tracing when there is a positive case in school. \nI think sometimes they have perhaps been erring on the side of caution, and sending whole year groups home if there has been a positive case, or whole classes. \nI think the PHA might be able to be a bit more forensic in identifying exactly who was a close contact. \nThat means the surge in demand for PCR tests in some parts of Northern Ireland would be somewhat reduced.\nNew self-isolation guidance for schools was issued on 26 August.\nIt changed previous guidance for close contacts to isolate for 10 days and aimed to reduce the time children spent out of school.\nBut the logistical burden of tracing asymptomatic close contacts has, in the main, been the responsibility of school principals and staff.\nThat has also led to high numbers of pupils self-isolating and seeking negative PCR tests to return to school.\nAny child with symptoms is still expected to stay off school and get a PCR test.\nIf that is positive they must self-isolate for 10 days.\nIf the move is approved by principals' representatives and unions, guidance on how the new arrangements will operate will be provided to schools.\nA number of teaching unions in Northern Ireland have called for the PHA to take responsibility for identifying close contacts of pupils in schools.\nPrincipal from Maghaberry Primary School and President of National Association of Headteachers NI (NAHTni) Graham Gault said the development was a \"significant step\".\nHe said contact tracing should never have fallen to school leaders.\nChris Donnelly, principal of St John The Baptist Primary School in Finaghy, said that while schools \"will welcome the easing of any type of administrative burden associated with contact tracing\" it was the case that \"the devil will be in the detail\". \nJustin McCamphill from teachers' union NASUWT said that while taking the job of contact tracing \"away from school principals\" was welcome, the union was urging caution around the proposals. \n\"We do worry that the PHA may not have the capacity to identify close cases as quickly as school principals did,\" Mr McCamphill told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"The experience of our leaders over the past few weeks has been that they have difficulty getting through to the PHA advice line.\n\"We think now if parents and pupils are making direct contact we don't know if the capacity is going to be there.\n\"The other issue of course is that if a six or seven-year-old is a close contact and gives their friend's name, how are the PHA going to make contact with that friend without going back through the school?\"\nMr McCamphill added that the union did not see the plan as \"something that's going to fix everything straight away\".\nIn England, Scotland and Wales public health authorities take on the responsibility for tracing close contacts of school pupils.\nIn Wales, for instance, the Test, Trace and Protect (TTP) programme gathers information from positive cases on their close contacts.\nChildren under 16 are spoken to alongside a parent or guardian.\nThe public health authorities, rather than schools, then advise close contacts whether they have to self-isolate or seek a PCR test.\nSimilar arrangements are in place in Scotland with the aim that whole classes or year groups are not routinely asked to stay at home in the event of a positive case."

      "tags": "Cawston,Disability,NHS,Mental health",
      "text": "The deaths of three adults with learning disabilities at a failed hospital should prompt a review to prevent further \"lethal outcomes\" at similar facilities, a report said. \nThere were significant failures in the care of the patients at Jeesal Cawston Park, Norfolk, it found. \nNorfolk Safeguarding Adults Board concluded such hospitals should \"cease to receive public money\". \nThe owner of Cawston Park said it was \"deeply sorry\" to the families.\nThe report looked at the deaths of Joanna Bailey, 36, and Nicholas Briant, 33, both of London; and Ben King, 32, from Norfolk, between April 2018 and July 2020.\nMr King's mother, Gina Egmore, said his death was a \"scandal\".\nMs Bailey, who had a learning disability, autism, epilepsy and sleep apnoea, was found unresponsive in her bed and staff did not attempt resuscitation, while the mother of Mr King said he was \"gasping and couldn't talk\" when she last saw him.\nMr Briant's inquest heard he died following cardiac arrest and obstruction of his airway after swallowing a piece of plastic cup. \nThe report found: \nJoan Maughan, who commissioned the report as chairwoman of the Norfolk Safeguarding Adults Board, said: \"This is not the first tragedy of its kind and, unless things change dramatically, it will not be the last.\"\nThe report recommends the Law Commission should review the current legal position of private companies providing services for adults with learning disabilities and autism.\n\"Unless this hospital and similar units cease to receive public money, such lethal outcomes will persist,\" author Margaret Flynn said.\nThe hospital, near Aylsham, closed in May after \"consistent failures in meeting standards\".\nOperator, Jeesal Akman Care Corporation, went into liquidation in June, owing almost \u00a34m.\nJoanna Bailey had a learning disability, autism, epilepsy and sleep apnoea.\nHer father Keith described her as a happy, fun-loving woman who loved Michael Jackson, musicals and pottery. \nThe coroner's report gave her cause of death as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), primary generalised epilepsy, obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea.\nMs Bailey was not checked for two hours the night she died on 28 April 2018, despite 30-minute checks being in her care plan.\nA registered nurse and five care workers - all first-aid trained - did not attempt resuscitation when she was found unresponsive in bed.\nShe used a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine for her sleep apnoea, but in the last 209 nights of her life, data showed it had only been used 29 times. \nThe report said the \"failure to ensure its regular use increased her risk of SUDEP\".\nIt also described how hospital records of her care were \"unaccountably inadequate\".\nBen King had Down's Syndrome, severe learning disability and sleep apnoea.\nHe weighed 15st 10lb (100kg) on admission in July 2018 but was 18st 1lb (115kg) when he died on 29 July 2020 after an obesity-related breathing disorder was incorrectly diagnosed.\nWhen distressed, he would smear his faeces, which, during his final hours, appeared to \"trigger\" a staff member.\nThe report says CCTV footage shows a staff member pushing Mr King roughly and dragging him down by his arms, before \"hitting his head area with an open hand\".\nNorfolk Police said an investigation into Mr King's treatment was ongoing and a \"number of inquiries have been carried out in an attempt to trace the suspect\".\nMs Egmore said her son was \"gasping and couldn't talk\" when she last saw him.\n\"They brought him out of a side door and he was slumped and held up by two staff,\" she said.\n\"He pleaded with me to take him home. I wish I had put him in the car then. I drove off.\"\nAn inquest heard that Nicholas Briant died of a brain injury following a cardiac arrest and obstruction of his airway after swallowing a piece of plastic cup. \nHe had told staff: \"I cannot breathe. I am dying.\" \nThe scene was captured on CCTV, and the coroner said staff did not appear \"to be doing anything\".\nThe Jeesal Akman Care Corporation said: \"The care they received at Cawston Hospital fell far below the standards we would have expected.\n\"We are deeply sorry that we let the families down.\n\"We closed Cawston Park Hospital and whilst the property is owned by our holding company, we will never run it as hospital again nor will we ever operate any other hospital.\"\nNorfolk and Waveney Clinical Commissioning Group revealed it had paid the hospital \u00a326,000 a month to look after Mr King.\nChief executive Melanie Craig said: \"What we did wasn't enough for Ben.\n\"It's very difficult with a private provider to know how the funds are being spent and that's one of the reasons we're using NHS facilities more and more. \n\"Sadly with Ben it was unavoidable because there are so few institutions and hospitals available to care for people with needs like Ben's.\"\nMs Flynn said \"not enough has changed\" since she carried out a previous review into the Winterbourne View scandal in 2011, when staff were secretly filmed by the BBC's Panorama programme abusing patients with learning disabilities.\nIn response, the government initiated the Transforming Care Programme to provide more community-based support to reduce \"inappropriate\" hospital admissions.\nBut more than 2,000 people are still in inpatient units like Cawston Park, according to a recent Commons report, which said \"they are unable to live fulfilled lives and are too often subject to treatment that is an affront to a civilised society\".\nThis is a truly shocking and distressing report, because of the appalling lack of care that Joanna, Ben and Nicholas experienced before their deaths.\nSo many of the failings outlined in this report have been identified many times before, but still for too many people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health needs when there is a crisis the only option is a long-stay institution.\nThe coalition government promised all such places would close by 2014, but the latest official figures show that there are still more than 2,000 people in assessment and treatment units in England, most have been there for more than two years.\nThe report also raises serious concerns about the lack of transparency and profit-making motives of private specialist hospitals, like Cawston Park, asking challenging questions about their continued use.\nMs Flynn believes \"searching questions\" need to be asked by the NHS, after she was told by Ms Bailey's father that the hospital was charging \u00a31,000 a day to care for his daughter.\n\"The way in which businesses have developed in this area arises from business opportunism rather than the need of a population of people with learning disabilities,\" she said.\nIn a statement, Norfolk County Council said it did not commission services at Cawston Park but did monitor the safeguarding of patients there.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said it had received the report and would be \"meeting with the authors to discuss their recommendations\".\nA spokesperson said: \"We are focussed on ensuring all patients, including people with a learning disability and autistic people, receive safe and high-quality care, and that they are treated with dignity and respect.\" \nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Scottish government",
      "text": "Comedian Janey Godley has been dropped from a Scottish government health campaign over \"unacceptable\" tweets. \nThe Glasgow performer was paid for a campaign to encourage face coverings and lateral flow testing. \nShe admitted the tweets, from a number of years ago, had \"terrible, horrific undertones\" after they were published by several newspapers. \nA Scottish government spokesperson said trust in its public health messages was \"paramount\". \nMs Godley, 60, gained a large online following for her viral voice-overs of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's daily briefings during the lockdowns. \nShe has apologised \"without reservation\" to \"everyone I hurt\" and offered to donate the fee for the advert to the STV Children's Appeal. \nA number of posts, the most recent of which was from 2017, were highlighted by the Scottish Sun. \nThe Daily Beast followed up by publishing several tweets from 2011 and 2012 about black performers. \nIn a statement, Ms Godley said: \"There are tweets from my past social media that are horridly offensive, I believe in progress not perfection and I am far from perfect. \n\"People have every right to go through my social media and see what values I hold and to find hurtful phrases and statements is shocking, I am deeply sorry to everyone I offended.\n\"Comedy is no excuse to use disgusting and hurtful words that affect people and I know many of you expected better of me. I apologise for every single word that upset people.\"\nMs Godley's #StopTheSpike adverts ran on TV and social media. She previously appeared in government-funded Zero Waste Scotland promotions. \nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"A series of unacceptable tweets by Janey Godley have been brought to our attention and, while she has rightly apologised, trust in our public health messages at this time is paramount. \n\"We have therefore taken the decision to withdraw any further campaign material in which Ms Godley features. \n\"The material will be discontinued immediately on our own channels and withdrawn as soon as possible from external media.\"\nMs Godley was brought up in the east end of Glasgow, and has spoken candidly of her traumatic early life which included poverty and sexual abuse, before beginning a comedy career later in life. \nShe has appeared on the BBC as panellist on shows such as BBC Radio Scotland's Breaking the News and BBC One's Have I Got News for You, and as an actor in Traces. \nShe has also performed with The National Theatre of Scotland and was a regular at the Edinburgh Fringe. \nHigh profile comedians, including David Baddiel and Dawn French, offered their support on Twitter on Wednesday and Aberdeen Performing Arts stood by their decision to cast her in their pantomime Beauty and the Beast this winter. \nOn Thursday, following the Daily Beast article, Ms Godley tweeted: \"I am not asking people who like me to defend the offensive things I said, I appreciate many people who enjoy my work are horrified and upset at my tweets, that's how it should be, I am not the victim here, the people I hurt and offended are and I take that responsibility.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of unvaccinated people ending up in hospital with Covid is \"concerning\", Boris Johnson has said.\nThree quarters of those admitted at hospitals such as St Thomas' had not had a Covid jab, with a \"higher proportion\" of younger people now being affected, he said.\nHe added that while lifting most restrictions in July continued to look right, there was still a risk as infections remained high. \nThe UK has reported more than 30,000 cases for the last nine days in a row.\nThe number of people in hospital with Covid is also rising. It currently stands at 7,907, compared to 5,697 a month ago.\nSpeaking at St Thomas' Hospital, London, the prime minister told the BBC: \"It'd be fair to say the decision to go ahead with the roadmap in the way that we did continues to look right. \n\"The openings that we did in July continue to look right - we're seeing the fastest growth of any G7 economy now we're comparatively open in this country. \n\"But we've got to be very clear with people. There still is a risk out there and there still is a pandemic, and the numbers of infections remain high or high-ish. \n\"I'm certainly concerned and what I'm particularly concerned about is that in great hospitals like this, 75% of the people who are succumbing to Covid still are not vaccinated.\"\nFour out of five people aged 16 and above have had two doses of a vaccine, while nearly 89% have had one dose.\n\"Sadly, we are seeing an increase in the proportion of Covid victims who are younger people,\" the prime minister said, urging those who were unvaccinated to get their jab.\n\"What we want to do is get people to see the value of vaccination to themselves and their families.\"\nWhat we are seeing with Covid is not a sudden surge like in previous waves, but a slow, gradual build-up of pressure.\nThe virus is not raging out of control, but it is still circulating and at quite a high level.\nThe vaccines are working really well.\nBut with one in five adults still not fully vaccinated, there are millions of people at risk. \nThat, as the prime ministers says, is the most significant cause of the pressure in hospitals.\nOnly around 7% of hospital beds are occupied by Covid patients, but if that keeps increasing along with the return of normal winter viruses, hospitals will have to start rationing other types of care more.\nIt's going to be a long, hard autumn and winter for the NHS.\nAsked about reports the government was planning of a \"firebreak\" lockdown in October, he said: \"There's been no discussion of anything like that.\"\nMr Johnson also reiterated the government's plan to offer a booster vaccine to the most vulnerable groups this month. \nIt had already been announced that half a million of the most vulnerable in the UK will be offered a third dose, following a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nAbout 400,000 to 500,000 people in the UK with severely weakened immune systems will be eligible for a third dose of vaccine.\nClarification 26th October 2021: In his interview with the BBC Boris Johnson highlighted that \"75% of the people who are succumbing to Covid still are not vaccinated,\" which we understood to be a comment on the general picture of hospital admissions, when addressing the state of the pandemic in the UK. His team later clarified that the figure of 75% related to \"major trusts like St Thomas' and so we have amended the article's second paragraph to precisely reflect that.\n"

      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The phrases have tripped off the tongues of Taliban for quite some time.  \n\"We're working to establish an inclusive government that represents all the people of Afghanistan,\" promised Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar when he recently arrived in Kabul to start talks aimed at forming a leadership to move the movement from guns to government.  \n\"We would like to live peacefully,\" vowed Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid at the first press conference in the capital after the Taliban suddenly swept into power on 15 August. \"We don't want any internal enemies and any external enemies.\" \nJudge them by their actions, not their words, has become the mantra of a fast-expanding league of Taliban watchers including Afghans, foreign governments, humanitarian chiefs and political pundits the world over. \nBut Afghans are watching most closely of all. They have to.  \nOn a day when brave protesters with bold banners spilled into the streets of Kabul and other cities - Afghan women leading the charge to demand their rights, their representation, their roles in society - the new Taliban government was unveiled.   \nWas this more evidence of the media-savvy Taliban? It temporarily knocked news of Taliban firing guns in the air, wielding rifle butts and sticks to disperse protesters, out of the world's headlines.  \nBut it was a modest ceremony, in the mundane setting of a press conference, for such a momentous, much-anticipated message. It electrified social media, and delivered a gut punch to those who had held fast to Taliban promises.  \nFar from being inclusive, it is exclusively Taliban. The old organigram of the Taliban movement, with its commissions, deputies, and the all-powerful Emir Hibatullah Akhundzada, has been transplanted into a cabinet with the same political architecture of governments everywhere. \nIts makeup is overwhelmingly drawn from Pashtun tribes, with only one Tajik and one Uzbek, both Talibs. There's not a single woman, not even in deputy minister positions. \nThe reviled Ministry of Vice and Virtue is back; the Women's Affairs Ministry is out. \nIt's a government of the old guard, and the new generation of mullahs and military commanders: men in charge when the Taliban ruled in the 1990s who return, beards much lighter and longer; former Guantanamo Bay prisoners; current members of US and UN black lists; battle-hardened fighters who pressed forward on every front in recent months; self-styled peacemakers who sat around negotiating tables, and shuttled around regional capitals with promises of a new Taliban 2.0.  \nSome names stick out - some so far they can seem provocative. \nThe caretaker head of cabinet is the white-bearded Mullah Hasan Akhund, a founding member of the Taliban who's on the UN's sanctions list. \nThe caretaker Minister of the Interior is Sirajuddin Haqqani. His face has rarely been seen except in a photograph, partially obscured by a caramel-coloured shawl, in a FBI wanted poster announcing a big bounty of $5m that's also on his head. His more recent claim to fame was an op-ed in the New York Times in 2020 calling for peace which failed to mention that the Haqqani Network named after his family is held responsible for some of the worst attacks on Afghan civilians. The Haqqanis insist there's no such network; they say they're part of the Taliban now.  \nThe caretaker Minister of Defence, Mullah Yaqoob, represented by a black silhouette, is the eldest son of the founding Emir of the Taliban, Mullah Omar. \nBut, wait, this is just a caretaker cabinet.  \nAt the press conference in Kabul, as a raucous chorus of questions rose from journalists in the room, it was said more posts might be announced in time. \"We haven't announced all the ministries and deputies yet so it's possible this list could be extended,\" Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission, told my colleague Secunder Kermani.  \nThis may be the opening political salvo to reward and reassure their rank and file fighters, many of whom have been streaming into Kabul, to welcome the return of a \"pure Islamic system\".   \nIt also appears as a carefully constructed compromise. Mullah Akhund suddenly emerged at the top, fixing in place rival political and military heavyweights including Mullah Baradar whom many predicted would take a leading role, instead of a deputy position.  \nTaliban leaders are said to have pushed back against calls to include political leaders from the past, especially those tainted by corruption, arguing they've already had their time at the top.  \nA phrase still rings in my ears from Taliban negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who's now been appointed as deputy foreign minister, the same role he held the last time round. \nWhen I asked him in February 2020, after the signing of the landmark US-Taliban deal, what he would say to Afghans who feared their return, he replied with great gusto: \"I tell them we will have a government acceptable to the majority.\" The word majority was punctuated by a loud emphasis. \nIn other words, a government dominated by traditional values, not what they mock as Western ideas.  \nThose were heady days when Afghans dared to hope the worst of the war was over. Later that year, on the first day of formal Afghan talks in the Gulf state of Qatar, a buzz shot through the room when the Taliban hinted they would no longer be demanding an Islamic Emirate; they said they understood its sensitivity.  \nIn talks with female negotiators, they reassured them women could play every role except president, including government ministers.  \nThat was then. This is now. The Taliban are in charge.\n\"Those who do not pay attention to the social fabric of Afghanistan will face serious challenges,\" warns negotiator and former MP Fawzia Koofi, who heard many of those promises.  \nThat challenge is already crystallising in protests on the streets, in statements from capitals around the world.  \n\"The world is watching closely,\" warned a statement from the US State Department. \"Little chance of international recognition of Taliban soon,\" declared an editorial in Russia's Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \nAnd a challenge may even rise from within a younger generation of Taliban.  \n\"We must pay attention to the lessons of history,\" a young Talib recently reflected to me. He emphasised that if the Taliban tried to dominate again, they could be toppled again, as they were in 2001, as the last government just was. Another expressed unease that mullahs schooled only in religious matters were being given so many posts. \nIn a statement issued soon after the caretaker cabinet was announced, the Emir noted that \"all talented and professional people\" were desperately needed for their \"talents, guidance, and work.\"   \nBut in all his exhortations, it was also clear the bottom line was about strengthening \"the system,\" the re-established Islamic Emirate. This takes precedence above all else.  \nIn recent days in Kabul, I've asked Taliban watchers of various ilk if they thought the leadership would harden over time, or open up.  \nPowerful winds could tilt them in many directions. \nThe world's major aid agencies, who provided around 80% of the old government's budget, are watching closely.\n\"They're in very, very dire straits,\" the UN's humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told me as he ended a visit where he emphasised the centrality of humanitarian principles and values, including the inclusion of women and girls. Senior officials, he remarked, asked him for patience and advice.  \nAfghanistan's new leaders are also under the microscope of jihadi movements worldwide who've enthusiastically welcomed a new land of Islamic governance compliant with Islamic Sharia law.  \nAfghanistan is, to use the expression, \"too big to fail\". Warnings about a safe haven for extremist groups, worries about human rights and a deepening humanitarian crisis of hunger and hardship, will concentrate many minds on trying to find a way to work with leaders still finding their way, still rooted in their past, rather than, as yet, a different kind of future.  \nBut that mantra will stick - actions, not words, matter most. \nIn the UK you can listen to Lyse Doucet's podcast, A Wish for Afghanistan, on BBC Sounds ."

      "tags": "France,November 2015 Paris attacks,Islamic State group",
      "text": "The only surviving member of the group suspected of being behind the 2015 Paris attacks says he and his fellow accused are \"being treated like dogs\". \nSalah Abdeslam and 19 other defendants are being tried in Paris over the attacks which left 130 dead. \nThe trial, which is expected to last nine months, began on Wednesday. \nThe shooting and bombing assault by Islamic State (IS) group extremists was the worst post-World War Two attack in France. \nFrench media report that Abdeslam shouted from the dock, saying he had not complained in the past because he would be \"resurrected\" after death. \n\"You should treat us like human beings,\" BFMTV quoted him as saying. \nCries of \"What about us? There were 130 deaths\" were heard in response from the courtroom. \nShortly after, the judge reminded Abdeslam that he was not in an \"ecclesiastical court but a democratic court\".\nAbdeslam also told the court: \"I gave up my job to become an Islamic State soldier.\" \nVictor Edou, a lawyer for eight survivors from the Bataclan attack, said some of his clients were \"not doing too well\" after hearing Abdeslam's remarks. \n\"It's going to be like that for nine months,\" he added. \nThe trial is being described as the biggest in France's modern history.\nThere will be more than 140 days of hearings involving about 330 lawyers, 300 victims and testimony from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who was French president when the attacks happened.\nAhead of the trial, Mr Hollande told French media that this was an important moment for the victims of the attacks, which he called an \"act of war\" at the time.\nIS admitted carrying out the co-ordinated attacks on the Bataclan concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars on 13 November 2015.\nThe suspects arrived at court in police vehicles under heavy security on Wednesday morning. They were seated together in the defendants' box, wearing face masks, before the trial opened.\nAsked by the court's top judge to identify himself, Abdeslam confirmed his name and said \"there is no god but Allah\" - an Islamic oath known as the Shahada.\nDay one of this monumental trial is over, with its mixture of confusion and solemnity, drama and tedium. At the start it was mayhem, as everyone milled around wondering where to go. But, at 13:00, the presiding judge entered the court and a stillness descended. I think at that point everyone drew a breath and understood the significance of the moment.\nThere were small excitements. Like when Salah Abdeslam - the key defendant - said that his profession was \"soldier of Islamic State\". And later there was a mini-confrontation when he complained about prison conditions, saying that it didn't matter because he knew that when he died he would be re-born, while for those facing him there would be a \"reckoning\".\nIs Salah Abdeslam shaping up to be the spokesman for the group in the dock? Is his bravado because he is insecure in his jihadist credentials? Remember, he failed in his apparent mission to blow himself up.\nAmid it all there was much of what accompanies all lengthy trials: long moments of not very much. The first two days will be taken up simply recording the names of all those hundreds of survivors and relatives who have registered as civil plaintiffs.\nThis will be the pattern. Periods of quiet punctuated by periods of high emotion. The trial for the events of 13 November 2015 will be both exhaustive and exhausting. \nAbdeslam's reference to being an IS soldier suggested he was still \"at war\", Jean-Pierre Albertini, whose son, Stephane, was killed in the Bataclan, told Reuters news agency.\nPhilippe Duperron also lost his son, Thomas, in the Bataclan attack. Mr Duperron said he had mixed feelings about the trial, not least impatience and anxiety.\n\"It will be the occasion for all the victims to bear witness, so it will be a very painful moment, and bring back the pain again,\" he said.\nAnother, Sophie Parra, told BFM TV she would testify at the trial despite her anxiety about facing the suspects in court.\nShe had had \"a lot of nightmares\" about \"all the possible scenarios\", she said, but felt it was something she had to do for those who were killed.\nOf the 20 suspects on trial, six are being tried in absentia. They are facing charges of murder, complicity and terrorist conspiracy.\nMost of the accused, including Abdeslam, could be sentenced to life in jail if convicted.\nAbdeslam, 31, is accused of providing logistical support to the assailants. Abdeslam fled the scene of the carnage after abandoning his suicide belt, which investigators later found to be defective.\nEurope's most-wanted man at the time, he was captured four months later in the Belgian capital, Brussels, after a shootout with police.\nAbdeslam has since refused to co-operate with French investigators. He remained largely silent throughout a separate trial in Belgium in 2018. There was much speculation about whether he would speak during this trial.\nThe area around the court was blocked off and armed police with dogs were on patrol ahead of the proceedings.\nThose attending the trial needed to pass through several checkpoints before being allowed into the specially built courtroom, which can seat hundreds.\nThe trial is being recorded for the archives but is not being broadcast live. Survivors and relatives of victims, known as civil plaintiffs in France, are able to follow along via streaming radio if they cannot attend.\nThe first days of the trial are expected to be largely procedural until victims are called to give testimony at the end of September. \nAbdeslam is the only surviving member of the group suspected of carrying out the attacks. He has been in jail since he was arrested in Belgium in 2016. \nThe 13 other defendants appearing in court are accused of a range of crimes, including financing and planning the attacks. On Wednesday, they also gave their names, addresses and professions.\nAmong them is Mohamed Abrini, who is accused of financing and supplying weapons to the attackers. The 36-year-old is due to stand trial over the 2016 Brussels bombings next year.\nOther suspects include Mohammed Amri, 33, and Hamza Attouh, 27, who were arrested in Belgium and admitted picking up Abdeslam in France and driving him back to Brussels immediately after the attacks.\nSix more are accused of helping organise the attacks and will be tried in absentia. Several of them are thought to be dead. They can be tried in absentia because they have never officially been declared dead."

      "text": "Coffee chain Costa Coffee has announced a 5% pay rise for 14,500 staff working at its company-owned stores in the UK.\nThe coffee chain is also recruiting 2,000 more people due to rising demand following the ease of Covid restrictions.\nCosta said the pay rise was to thank staff for their hard work during the pandemic.\nThis follows redundancies last year when the coffee chain was forced to cut costs. \nIn September 2020, Costa put up to 1,650 jobs at risk after demand failed to rebound following the first coronavirus lockdown. In the end it made 609 people redundant. \nThe coffee chain said it now needs more staff to support new stores and rising demand as it prepares for the typically-busy festive period.\nOn average, store team members will take home \u00a3500-\u00a3900 more per year once the wage increase comes into effect from 1 October.\nCosta owns 1,500 stores in the UK, while another 1,200 stores are franchise-owned.\nThe pay rise does not include workers at franchise-owned stores.\n\"Our team members are the heart of our business and as we continue to emerge stronger from the pandemic, this 5% pay increase is one way we are able to show our thanks to them,\" said Neil Lake, managing director of Costa Coffee UK & Ireland.\n\"Our teams have been through the most challenging year and a half in living memory and have shown incredible passion, resilience, and commitment as they continue to serve perfectly crafted cups of Costa coffee to consumers across the country.\"\nCosta said all store team members would receive a pay increase of at least 45p per hour, meaning minimum pay for the role will rise from \u00a38.91 to \u00a39.36 per hour.\nStaff at the rank of \"Barista Maestro\", who oversee how the coffee is made and manage branches, will receive a pay rise of 65p per hour, bringing their minimum pay up from \u00a39.64 to \u00a310.29 per hour.\nWhile top rates of pay vary according to location and experience, Costa said the top rate for store staff would go up from \u00a310.64 to \u00a311.29 per hour.

      "title": "Channel migrants: What happens to people crossing to the UK?",
      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,English Channel,Refugees and asylum seekers,Europe migrant crisis",
      "text": "At least 27 people have drowned crossing the English Channel by boat.\nRecord numbers of migrants have attempted the journey in recent months.\nThe UK sends Border Force ships out to spot small boats - but there is little they can do other than rescue people in danger. \nEarlier this week France announced an extra \u20ac11m (\u00a39.3m) worth of equipment and 100 vehicles to tackle smuggling along the coast. \nThat kit includes beach-ready quad bikes and zodiac boats, very fast small vessels favoured by the military. Teams have also been given more night-vision equipment to help identify people hiding in sand dunes. \nFrance has cancelled this weekend talks on the issue after Boris Johnson published a letter to President Macron. In it the PM said France should take back migrants who have crossed the Channel.\nFrance insists it's doing all it can to stop crossings. Interior minister Gerald Darmanin said the French authorities stopped 671 migrants on Wednesday alone.\nCalais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont told the BBC it wasn't realistic to think police officers could patrol 200-300km [125-186 miles] of coastline 24 hours a day, given \"it only takes five to 10 minutes to take a boat and fill it with migrants\".\nThe UK has pledged to give France \u20ac62.7m (\u00a354m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols, boost aerial surveillance and strengthen security at ports. It's being paid in instalments, which have started.\nThe two countries have also set up a joint intelligence group, which has contributed towards 94 investigations. \nThere have been 65 small boat-related prosecutions in England since 2020 - and nearly 300 arrests in France.  \nIn November more than 1,000 people arrived in a single day, for the first time.\nMore than 25,000 people have crossed the Channel so far this year - but that figure doesn't tell the whole story.\nNearly 45,000 people sought asylum in the UK in the most recent year for which we have data. So, the number who cross the Channel in boats are only part of the total.\nThe UK receives less than half of the asylum applications which France gets. \nMost refugees stop in the country bordering their own: there are about 3,700,000 displaced Syrian people in Turkey. The UK has taken in less than 1% of that number through resettlement or asylum from Syria since 2014. \nIf migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port. \nIf they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them. Each country has search-and-rescue zones.\nThe distance between Dover and Calais, where many migrants cross, is just 20 miles, and none of it counts as international waters. \nOnce migrants are in the UK, they are usually taken to short-term holding centres.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in any country they arrive in. They don't have to seek asylum in the first safe country reached.\nHowever, an EU-wide law called Dublin III, allows asylum seekers to be sent back to the first member state they were proven to have entered. \nBetween 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2020, 231 migrants who crossed the Channel were returned to mainland Europe using Dublin III.\nHowever, the UK is no longer part of this arrangement since leaving the European Union. The UK has not agreed a scheme to replace it, making the transfer of migrants more difficult. \nImmigration minister Tom Pursglove told MPs on 17 November that only five people had been returned to mainland Europe so far in 2021.  \nPriti Patel has authorised Border Force officials to turn back boats carrying migrants to the UK in limited circumstances.\n\"Push back at sea\" is a tactic that is used in Australia. However, France has not co-operated with the UK's approach.\nAs soon as the boats leave French waters - which the UK authorities cannot enter without France's consent - and enter the UK's, they are subject to the protection of UK law, says Prof Andrew Serdy, a maritime law expert. \n\"If France doesn't want to take them back once they have left, it cannot be forced to do so and a stand-off ensues.\" \nA boat can also only be pushed back if it's clear that doing so won't endanger lives, which could be difficult to prove with a small dinghy.\nBut speaking in the House of Commons, the home secretary said she \"had not ruled anything out\" and gave the example of \"Greece in terms of push-backs\", adding that the Greeks use the military including special forces as well as the coastguard to achieve this.\nMany of the migrants crossing the English Channel claim asylum once they arrive in the UK. Asylum seekers hope to receive refugee status, meaning they can stay. \nThey must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. \nTheir asylum application can include their partner and any children under 18, if they are also in the UK.\nDecisions are made by a caseworker. They consider things like the country of origin of the asylum seeker, or evidence of discrimination. \nThis is supposed to be done within six months, although most wait longer.\nAnyone granted refugee status can remain in the country with their dependants for five years. After that, they can apply to settle in the UK.\nAlternatively, they may get permission to stay for other humanitarian reasons. This means they do not qualify for refugee status but are nevertheless at risk of serious harm on return to their country of origin due to:\nFamily members not already in the UK can apply to join those with refugee status or humanitarian protection.\nThey may also be given permission to stay for other reasons - for example, if they are an unaccompanied minor or a victim of trafficking. How long they can stay will depend on their situation.  \nIn 2020, more than 36,000 people, including dependents, applied for asylum in the UK.\nAbout 10,000 were offered refugee status or other protections. \nBoth of these figures were down on the previous year, probably due to the impact of coronavirus. \nWhile an asylum claim is being processed, people are given financial help towards their living costs.\nAsylum seekers aren't allowed to work - or take formal unpaid positions such as internships - unless they have waited more than a year for a decision. They can, however, volunteer to help charities or community organisations.\nThis controversial rule is aimed at preventing people applying for asylum as a route to work in the UK. Critics say it prevents refugees integrating into communities and wastes the skills they have brought with them.\nAsylum seekers cannot choose where they live. Most are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before moving to longer-term housing.\nMuch of this accommodation has previously been criticised by the immigration watchdog.\nAsylum seekers can get a cash allowance of \u00a339.63 per week for each household member, with extra support available for vulnerable groups such as children or pregnant women.\nAsylum seekers with an active application are entitled to free healthcare and children must attend school. \nIf asylum isn't offered and no other reason to stay in the UK is accepted, the person will be asked to leave the UK, either voluntarily or by force. \nThey can appeal against the decision. Around 30% of appeals were accepted between 2004 and 2020, meaning those individuals were allowed to stay.\nMigrants can receive legal aid for these appeals, which can sometimes take years, as well as continued financial and housing support.

I respectfully point out that the move of some teaching, learning and assessment online was already happening pre-Covid.\n\"The pandemic merely accelerated the pace of change,\" said Prof West, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England Bristol."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has accused a charity of trying to airbrush the achievements of ex-Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\nHis criticism came after the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust renamed itself The Churchill Fellowship and removed images of the ex-PM from its website.\nSir Nicholas Soames, Sir Winston's grandson, said his family \"fully and unreservedly support\" the charity's \"remarkable\" work.\nAnd the charity has insisted it was not \"disowning Sir Winston\".\nIt said the change came about because the former name of the organisation was \"confusing to people and did not explain what we do\".\nBut Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told LBC radio the charity was pandering \"to a noisy woke brigade who are trying to challenge all aspects of our history\".\nIn a statement on its website, The Churchill Fellowship said: \"The key element we kept was the name 'Churchill' - you cannot look at our new logo and avoid the importance we attach to that name.\"\nIt added that Sir Winston was internationally admired for \"saving Britain and the world from Nazism\" but there was also \"controversy about his views on race\". \n\"None of this takes away from Sir Winston's enormous contribution to the world as we know it today.\" \nMr Johnson has long been an admirer of Sir Winston and has written a biography of the Conservative politician. \nAsked about the charity's decision, the Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The prime minister believes Winston Churchill is a hero\", adding \"there is a never ending political debate about who is sufficiently pure and politically correct\".\nHe urged the charity to \"think again and not try to re-write the past\". \nOn Friday, Mr Dowden added to the criticism, saying: \"They would not have the freedom - no-one would have the freedom - to make these kinds of decisions were it not for Churchill in the first place.\n\"I do really worry when we start to question the sort of values that have made this such a wonderful country.\"\nThe Churchill Fellowship - which is chaired by Sir Winston's grandson Jeremy - offers grants to enable people to study practical topics abroad. \nSir Winston is often described as one of the country's greatest prime ministers for his role leading the country against the Nazis during World War Two. \nHe is credited with maintaining morale during a difficult time for the country and refusing to negotiate with Adolf Hitler in the early years of the war. \nHowever, he has also been accused of racism - for example in 1937, he told the Palestine Royal Commission: \"I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.\"\nThe wartime leader has also been accused of failing to support Indians during the Bengal famine - in which three million people are believed to have died - instead prioritising wheat supplies for European and Australian civilians. \nBut Allen Packwood, director of the Churchill Archives Centre, has said there were \"always going to be conflicting priorities and demands\" during a global war and that the prime minister was \"not always going to get everything right\"."

A police investigation is ongoing. \nHowever, Mr Stokes was employed to do regular risk assessments for the tower, and could have checked with others that a safe cladding system had been installed. \nA question for the inquiry will be whether that was his job. \nWhen he gave evidence Mr Stokes was adamant it was not. He said he did not even know Grenfell was being fitted with cladding until he walked past in 2014 and saw a sample for residents to assess. \nAn earlier expert witness, fire engineer Colin Todd, told the inquiry in July that assessing the cladding was beyond the expertise of risk assessors. \nHe said it was reasonable to assume the cladding complied with building regulations because the council's building control was involved. \nBut Dr Lane, who has been giving a week of evidence, said Mr Stokes should have checked whether the newly renovated walls of the tower complied with safety rules, as part of his inspection.\nIf you want to find out more about the Grenfell Tower public inquiry you can find all episodes of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast on the BBC website."

Since it began, hospitals in England have treated more than 450,000 patients with coronavirus.\nMPs this week also voted for a longer term plan for a new tax to fund health and social care.\nNHS England figures show that waiting times for ambulances were slightly shorter, on average, in August than in July. But they were still more than one minute longer than the seven-minute target for responding to the most urgent calls.\nThese are for people who are struggling to breathe or have had a cardiac arrest.\nThe average response time for an ambulance that can take a patient to hospital - rather than a paramedic coming by bike or car - for this category in August was close to the worst on record - 11 minutes 10 seconds.\nHave you experienced a long wait for an ambulance? Please share your experiences.\nAnd for category 2 emergency calls - which cover heart attacks, seizures and road traffic accidents - the average wait was more than 38 minutes, despite a target of 18 minutes.\nHeart specialist Dr Aseem Malhotra believes his father's death in July could have been prevented if an ambulance had arrived more quickly.\nHis father, Prof Kailash Chand, had complained of chest discomfort before asking for help from neighbours, who were also doctors. They called an ambulance because they believed Prof Chand had had a cardiac arrest, and tried to resuscitate him.\nDr Malhotra was on the phone to them at the time.\n\"I stayed on the line - 10 minutes passed, 15 minutes passed, 20 minutes passed. \n\"It took over 30 minutes before the ambulance arrived,\" he said.\nDr Malhotra then saw his father being attached to a heart monitor via a videocall.\n\"It was the flat line. There was nothing to shock.\n\"We had missed that window. My father was gone.\"\nDr Malhotra said if he'd known the ambulance would take so long, he would have asked the neighbour to take him straight to hospital.\nNorth West Ambulance says it is investigating the incident.\nThe figure of 5.6 million people waiting to start routine NHS hospital treatment is the highest since records began in August 2007, and up from 5.45m in July.\nNearly 1.8 million have been waiting longer than 18 weeks, while more than 293,000 have been waiting for more than a year.\nThat number has fallen - a sign of efforts to tackle the backlog caused by Covid.\nNHS England said staff had contended with one of the busiest summers on record in A&E, and hospitals were currently treating more than 6,000 patients with Covid. A total of around half a million Covid patients have been treated to date in English hospitals.\nProf Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said: \"NHS staff have pulled out all the stops to deliver millions more tests, checks, treatments and operations than they did last summer despite caring for many more Covid patients.\n\"We do not know how many of those who held back from accessing care during the pandemic still need treatment, but we expect more to come forward in the coming months, and I urge anyone who needs the NHS to come forward.\"\nMr Tim Mitchell, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said the waiting times figures showed new funding for planned surgery was \"sorely needed\". \n\"Behind these eye-watering statistics are patients waiting in pain for hip and knee replacements and for heart, brain and other operations,\" he said.\nThe new surgical hubs planned by the NHS to keep surgery going if there are further outbreaks of Covid would need additional doctors, nurses and surgeons to staff them, Mr Mitchell said.\nData shows there are long waiting times for ambulances across the three other UK nations, but these waits are measured differently and can't be directly compared.

      "text": "Scotland's space industry says it wants to operate in an environmentally-friendly way.\nBut with plans lodged for several space ports, bringing the prospect of more regular launches, can blasting rockets into space ever be green?\nThe industry is a thriving one, according to Daniel Smith of the Scottish Space Leadership Council and founder of space marketing company, AstroAgency.\n\"Glasgow makes more satellites than anywhere else in the world outside of California, and there are five space ports planned for Scotland,\" he says.\nThose proposed locations are Unst in Shetland; North Uist in the Western Isles; Machrihanish in Argyll; the Moine peninsula in Sutherland and Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire - where it has been proposed to launch human space flights by 2035.\nSome of the sites - potentially Space Hub Sutherland in the north west Highlands, Spaceport 1 in North Uist and SaxaVord Spaceport in Unst - could be launching small, micro and pocket-sized nano satellites into space on a regular basis from next year.\nOne of the companies involved in Space Hub Sutherland, rockets manufacturer Orbex, has set up its UK headquarters in Forres in Moray.\nSeveral landmark launches and rocket tests have already taken place in Scotland, where rocket launches have taken place since the 1930s.\nIn 2016, a rocket fired from the Hebrides Rocket Range, a military missile test site in the Western Isles, became the first vehicle to be launched into space from UK soil.\nThree years later, a balloon designed for delivering small satellites into orbit was tested from SaxaVord Spaceport.\nThe launch - described as the UK's first commercial spaceflight-related activity - saw the balloon soar 37km (23 miles) to the edge of Earth's atmosphere.\nLast year saw the UK's first complete ground rocket test to be carried out in 50 years.\nThe 11m (36ft) tall Skylark-L rocket was tested at Kildermorie Estate, near Alness in the Highlands, by Edinburgh-based space technologies firm Skyrora.\nThe rocket performed all the actions of a launch while restrained to the ground to prevent it from taking off.\nAnd last month, a \"flight test vehicle\" called ADA was launched by East Anglian firm Gravitilab Aerospace Services from Benbecula Airport as part of work to open Spaceport 1 at Scolpaig, North Uist, in 2022. \nBackers of these projects include Western Isles local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, public agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Melness Crofters' Estate.\nThe estate's chairwoman Dorothy Pritchard expects a spaceport in Sutherland to create much-needed skilled jobs for young people in the Highlands.\nShe says the proposal is to create the world's first working croft land and carbon-neutral space hub - and that the priority has always been that \"the close-knit crofting community, its stunning landscape, and native wildlife are protected\".\nWhile Scotland will never see big Nasa-style rocket launches, even small-scale operations involving rockets only a few metres long can still pose environmental challenges.\nThe key issues are fuel and what do to about spent rockets and redundant satellites.\nRocket fuels can include potentially harmful and corrosive materials such as hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide or nuclear materials.\nRocket engines can also produce large amounts of sulphur, along with greenhouse gases and leave soot in the atmosphere.\n\"Space debris is probably the most topical problem,\" says Daniel Smith.\nThe debris - also known as space junk - includes hundreds of millions of pieces of broken satellites and fragments of rockets whizzing around in Earth's orbit at speeds of up to 17,500 mph (28,163 km/h).\nThis creates the risk of collisions with working satellites - as well as the International Space Station, and the astronauts that crew it.\nThe Scottish Space Leadership Council, through its Sustainable Space Task Force, has brought together Scottish manufacturers, data firms and others in a campaign to make getting to space less damaging to the planet.\nThe industry has been asked to solve challenges which include finding a way of measuring the \"true impact\" of the international space sector on the environment.\nScotland's first sustainable space summit was held in June, and featured a message from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\nThe campaign has also asked public body NatureScot and environmental group Friends of the Earth Scotland about what changes they want to see.\nDaniel Smith says involving potential critics of the space industry makes the campaign unique.\nHe says the industry wants to play a part in tackling climate change, adding: \"It's the right thing to do.\"\nIndividual companies say they are trying to make a difference.\nOrbex says its rockets are designed to be reusable and will use bio-propane, which the company describes as a \"completely renewable biofuel\". \nIt says the fuel has 90% less CO2 emissions than kerosene-based rocket fuels, and leaves no soot in the atmosphere.\nOrbex also says construction and operation of its launch site - Space Hub Sutherland - will be carbon neutral and that peat lifted during the building work will be laid over \"scars\" left by the harvesting of peat in the local area.\nSkyrora has been carrying out tests using Ecosene, a fuel made from waste plastic.\nThe Scottish company is developing its own method to make the fuel from non-recyclable, or least recycled, plastics such as polystyrene and types of plastics used in making polytunnel sheets and toys.\nSkyrora said emissions tests had shown the fuel resulted in a vast reduction in sulphur and greenhouse gases.\nDaniel Smith says Scotland's space industry has also sought to help address the problem of space junk.\n\"Smaller satellites reduce the chance of collisions,\" he says. \"There is also work being done to make satellites burn up when they are no longer needed.\"\nDr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, says conservation and environmental groups rely on satellite data for their work, but they also want to see the industry operate in a sustainable way. \nHe says: \"From measuring shrinking forests to telling us who is most affected by climate change, the space industry makes a great contribution in highlighting environmental threats to our natural systems.  \n\"Of course there is a cost to getting this data and the industry needs to look at the propellants it uses, the distances its many components travel and even the tourist traffic launches generate.\n\"The satellite and launch industry is growing rapidly but there is a lively and welcome discussion about creating a environmental strategy for the space industry in Scotland to drive change and both minimise environmental impact and maximise the value of data from space to the environment.\"\nYes, with strong criticism of those planned for the Highlands and North Uist.\nThe planning application for Space Hub Sutherland sparked 457 objections, many on environmental grounds, compared with 118 representations in support of the proposals.\nIt has also faced opposition from the Protect The Mhoine (PTM) pressure group, while billionaires Anders and Anne Holch Povlsen went to court to challenge the project.\nThe couple own land near the proposed site and have concerns about its impact on protected habitats.\nTheir company, Wildland Ltd, raised the legal action against Highland Council's decision to give planning approval, arguing that it failed to take into account the risks to the local environment and wildlife.\nBut last month a judge said he was \"not persuaded\" that the local authority had erred in law, and rejected the legal challenge.\nMeanwhile, the Povlsens have invested almost \u00a31.5m in SaxaVord Spaceport.\nThe Shetland site is a former RAF station, while the one in Sutherland is undeveloped peatland. A spokesman for the Povlsens said the Unst project would still need to cross a \"high environmental bar\".\nThe Western Isles' Spaceport 1 has encountered opposition from the North Uist Conservation Group.\nThe campaigners said the land would be lost to concrete structures and raised concerns about the potential impact on St Kilda, a Unseco World Heritage site.\nSt Kilda lies about 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist, the nearest inhabited place to the archipelago."

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "title": "National Insurance: What\u2019s the new Health and Social Care tax and what will it cost me?",
      "tags": "Tax,Personal finance,Social care,Pay,Income tax",
      "text": "National Insurance payments are increasing in April, to fund social care in England and help the NHS recover after the pandemic.\nBut there has been criticism that the move is unfair on the lower-paid, especially when the cost of living is rising.\nEmployees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022.\nBut from April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate.\nInstead, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy.\nThis levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working.\nFrom April, people earning under \u00a39,880 a year, or \u00a3823 a month, won't have to pay National Insurance, or the new levy when it is introduced.\nHowever, those earning more than \u00a312,875 a year will pay more.\nFor example, an employee on \u00a320,000 a year will pay an extra \u00a389 a year. Someone on \u00a350,000 will pay \u00a3464 more. \nNational Insurance is a UK-wide tax.\nAlthough the government decision to increase it is focussed on funding health and social care in England, the tax increase is also expected to raise an additional \u00a32.2bn for services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThere are concerns the increase will have a higher impact on the lower-paid.\nThis is because workers pay 12% National Insurance on earnings between \u00a39,564 (\u00a39,880 from April) and \u00a350,268. However, earnings above this amount attract a rate of just 2%. \nSo, if your income rises above \u00a350,000, National Insurance takes a smaller proportion of your wages. \nThe Health and Social Care Levy will work the same way as National Insurance.\nThe government is also going back on a promise made in its 2019 election manifesto not to raise National Insurance.\nHowever, Boris Johnson said the increase was because of Covid and the burden it placed on the NHS.\nThe government says the changes are expected to raise \u00a312bn a year.\nInitially, this will go towards easing pressure on the NHS .\nA proportion will then be moved into the social care system.\nThis mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication.\nThe aim is to make sure people in England pay no more than \u00a386,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food).\nAnyone with assets - like their home, savings and investments - worth less than \u00a320,000 will have their care fully covered by the state.\nThose with between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3100,000 in assets will have their care costs subsidised.\nAt present, to get your care paid for by your local council, you must have a very high level of need and also savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 in England.\nBelow that level the amount you pay reduces until you have less than \u00a314,250, at which point the council pays for your care if you qualify.\nThe care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the pandemic. It has been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending.\nThis has also put pressure on the NHS because people cannot be discharged from hospital if they don't have anywhere suitable to go.\nIn Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than \u00a3100 a week.\nIn Northern Ireland, no-one over the age of 75 pays for home care.\nScotland provides free personal care for people who are assessed as needing support at home, whatever their age.\nIn Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than \u00a318,000. \nThose with savings and assets of between \u00a318,000 and \u00a328,750 have to fund part of their care. \nPeople with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a \u00a3193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and \u00a387.10 a week towards nursing care.\nUPDATE: Figures for how much the increase in National Insurance will cost were updated to take into account the rise in the primary threshold from April 2022 in line with inflation."

      "text": "Universities have been urged to provide face-to-face teaching when students return this term.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said students should expect to be taught \"in-person and alongside other students\".\nIt would be right to stay online when there's a \"genuine benefit to using technology\", he said.\nBut he warned university leaders: \"I do not expect to see online learning used as a cost-cutting measure.\"\nParents would find it \"odd\" if students could go to other social activities but were not allowed back into lecture halls, the education secretary told the Universities UK conference.\nRecord numbers of 18 year olds from the UK will be starting university this autumn - and Mr Williamson, speaking via a video link, said students were craving a \"return to normality\".\nEven with safety measures against Covid, the education secretary said there should not be unnecessary delays on starting face-to-face classes.\nTeaching students in-person could be more effective, said Mr Williamson, allowing them to benefit from the \"conversations you have around the margins\", and from the support of other students.\nTrying to teach \"complex molecular biology techniques\" was much harder over Zoom, he told the conference at Northumbria University.\nDuring the past two academic years, the pandemic saw much teaching switching to online - but there have been petitions from students concerned that lectures might carry on online into the autumn term.\nAn annual survey on value for money highlighted complaints from students about paying full tuition fees for online learning.\nThe education secretary, who faced criticism this week after he confused footballer Marcus Rashford with rugby player Maro Itoje in an interview, also reiterated warnings about universities where too few students went on to graduate jobs.\nIt was \"simply unacceptable\" that at 25 higher education institutions, fewer than half of students progressed to such graduate posts or further study, said Mr Williamson.\nHe reaffirmed suggestions of introducing minimum entry requirements for university courses, such as a good pass at GCSE English and maths.\nAnd he said the government would press ahead with proposed changes to the admissions timetable, so that students would have their A-level results before completing their applications.\nThere were suggestions from university heads at the meeting that some students preferred the greater flexibility of online lectures, such as those with caring responsibilities.\nSteve West, the new president of Universities UK, said there would be a return to in-person teaching where possible, but he suggested a blend of online and face-to-face study would emerge - and that the greater use of digital technology could enhance learning.\n\"To politicians and commentators who have asked: 'Why not everything in person?' I respectfully point out that the move of some teaching, learning and assessment online was already happening pre-Covid.\n\"The pandemic merely accelerated the pace of change,\" said Prof West, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England Bristol."
