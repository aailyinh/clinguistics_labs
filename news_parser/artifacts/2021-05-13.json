      "text": "Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired dozens of rockets at Israel after its air strikes killed top commanders and felled another tower block there.\nThe escalation, which began on Monday, has triggered street violence in Israel between Jews and Israeli Arabs. \nIn two incidents, a Jewish man in Acre was attacked by Arab men, and a Jewish mob pulled a Palestinian out of his car and beat him up in Bat Yam.\nAt least 67 people in Gaza and seven people in Israel have been killed.\nThe fighting erupted on Monday after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews.\nMore than 374 people were arrested and 36 officers were injured after clashes in Israeli cities, Israeli police said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking late on Wednesday night, said he planned to send in military forces to help police maintain order in cities ruptured by violence.\nMr Netanyahu said the attacks in recent days amounted to \"anarchy\".\n\"Nothing can justify an Arab mob assaulting Jews, and nothing can justify a Jewish mob assaulting Arabs,\" he said in a video statement, as reported by the Times of Israel.\nMilitant groups in Gaza, run by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, have been firing rockets into Israel since Monday night, and Israel has responded by hitting targets in the territory.\nOn Thursday morning, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said about 1,500 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israeli cities since hostilities escalated at the start of this week.\nThe health ministry in Gaza says that more than 400 people have been injured there since the conflict began, in addition to the 67 who have died.\nMr Netanyahu said the government would use all its strength to protect Israel from enemies on the outside and rioters on the inside.\nBut the Palestinian Authority, which governs in parts of the West Bank, condemned Israel's \"military aggression\" in a tweet, saying it was \"traumatising an already beleaguered population of two million people\".\nThe militants in Gaza said they had fired 130 rockets into Israel in response to an Israeli air raid which destroyed the al-Sharouk tower in Gaza City.\nThe tower, which is the third tall building to be destroyed by air strikes this week, housed al-Aqsa TV, the station run by Hamas.\nIsrael said it had killed senior Hamas officials in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites. Hamas confirmed a senior commander and \"other leaders\" had died.\nThe IDF said on Wednesday that their strikes on Gaza were the largest since the conflict in 2014.\nResidents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths.\nFive members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency.\n\"We were laughing and having fun when suddenly they began to bomb us. Everything around us caught fire,\" their 14-year-old cousin, Ibrahim, said, breaking down in tears as he described their death.\nMeanwhile millions of Israelis were in bomb shelters on Wednesday evening, according to the IDF, after sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country.\nAnna Ahronheim, the defence and security correspondent of the Jerusalem Post, described spending Tuesday night in a shelter with her five-month-old baby.\n\"To hear hundreds of interceptions and even to hear rockets fall near us was horrifying,\" she told the BBC.\nA child killed in the Israeli town of Sderot was named as Ido Avigal, aged six, who was caught in an attack on a block of flats.\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"gravely concerned\" by the ongoing violence. The UN Security Council has met to discuss the issue, but has not issued a statement.\nIn a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden offered his support for Israel's security but stressed the need to restore \"a sustainable calm\".\n\"My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nUS Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he had sent an envoy to the region to meet both sides.\nRussia has called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia).\nA Russian foreign ministry statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped \"violent acts\" in East Jerusalem and \"illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents\".\nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded.\nPalestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April.\nIt was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day.\nThe fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own.\nAre you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

      "title": "The NHS Covid legacy - long waits and lives at risk",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Birmingham,NHS,Cancer",
      "text": "Covid has left a toxic legacy for the NHS, with hospitals facing a huge backlog, putting lives at risk, patient groups and staff are warning.\nAnd in-depth analysis by BBC News has found:\nIt comes as NHS England has launched a \u00a3160m initiative to tackle the growing waiting lists.\nA network of \"accelerator\" areas is being established to pilot new initiatives, including extra clinics at weekends, virtual assessments at home and new clinics that can complete high numbers of cataract operations\nNHS England chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard says: \"With Covid cases in hospitals now significantly reducing, our focus is on rapidly recovering routine services.\"\nElaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January. \nThe 61-year-old, from Essex, was immediately classed as an urgent case - and should have been operated on within weeks. \nBut her operation was cancelled - because of the pandemic and the backlog it had caused. \nIt was \"the most horrendous day\", she says. \"Every day that I'm not on a surgical operating table, it is more of a risk.\" \nElaine is now due to have surgery on Friday - but the wait has taken its toll. \nShe has been seeing a psychologist to help her emotionally, while physically she has started to deteriorate. \n\"I have got weaker,\" she says. \"I'm in more pain. Things I could do then, I can't now.\"\nElaine's story is not unique. Analysis by BBC News shows the numbers starting treatment within the target time have fallen during the pandemic. \nAnd some trusts are struggling to start treatment for even half of patients in the recommended timeframe - two months following an urgent referral from their GP.\nFor University Hospitals Birmingham, that proportion is well under a half.\nIt has seen performance deteriorate despite sending patients to be treated in local private hospitals.\nThe trust has treated more Covid patients than any other in the country - more than 14,000 have been admitted since the start of the pandemic, leading to the redeployment of 1,500 staff locally.\nLike others, it says the disruption has been unavoidable - and it is now \"working hard\" to have patients diagnosed and treated.\nBut it has found not all the delays are caused by the disruption to services.\nAbout one in every four of the patients waiting the longest has postponed treatment themselves - and nurses at the trust have been phoning and pleading with them to have treatment.\nThis reluctance to come forward coupled with problems accessing GP and screening services at points in the pandemic is the reason why the number of patients coming forward for checks and being diagnosed has dropped - although there are now signs the numbers are rising.\nNonetheless, analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests across the UK there are 45,000 \"missing\" cancer patients. \nAnd the charity fears this will lead to more later-stage diagnoses, which reduce the chances of survival.\n\"The knock-on impact of the pandemic on cancer care cannot be overstated,\" Steven McIntosh says. \"We're likely to be dealing with Covid's long shadow for many years to come.\"\nAttempts are being made to get people to come forward. An NHS advertising campaign, Help Us, Help You, is urging people with cancer symptoms to come forward.\nBut cancer doctor and Catch Up With Cancer Campaign founder Prof Pat Price says a \"monumental political effort\" is needed, with significant investment in equipment and the workforce to \"super-boost\" services. \n\"Services have suffered years of underinvestment - so we were already at a disadvantage,\" she adds.\nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the legacy of Covid. \nCancer was actually one of the areas of the health service prioritised from the very start to try to keep disruption to a minimum.\nAn analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Imperial College London has been looking at how all hospital services have been affected. It has focussed on England - although problems have been reported across the UK nations.\nIts report breaks the impact of the pandemic down by emergency admissions, planned care and outpatient work. \nCancer falls in all three categories and the data shows it has actually seen one of the smallest drops in activity with services such as knee and hip replacements affected much more.\nOverall planned care fell by a third in 2020 - with the north of England and Midlands hardest hit.\nOutpatient appointments fell by a fifth - with the amount of physiotherapy provided almost halving - as did non-Covid emergency admissions \nThe report says this will have a considerable impact on the quality of life and health of many people.\nThe consequence of this has been longer waiting times for many non-emergency treatments.\nIn England, nearly 5 million people are now on a hospital waiting list - 9% of the population - the highest number since records began, in 2007. \nA similar proportion are waiting in Scotland, while in Wales it is 17% and Northern Ireland 23%.\nMost worrying, the numbers waiting over a year have rocketed - in England, from 1,600 before the pandemic to 436,000 at the end of March 2021.\nNearly a third of hospitals now have more than one in every 10 of their patients in this position. A handful have one in every five.\nOne of those is Hull University Teaching Hospitals, which before the pandemic had none, chief operating officer Ellen Ryabov says.\nIt is now running extra weekend clinics, as well as using the private sector, she says, adding: \"Our aim is to get down to 14.5% of patients waiting over 52 weeks by the end of September and then look to clear that entirely.\" \nBut in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for \"life-transforming\" surgery can be devastating.\nBrenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019.\nThe 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months.\n\"The hip pain is unbearable,\" she says. \"I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house.\n\"Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with.\"\nBut the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020.\n\"The problems predate the pandemic,\" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  \"We already had too few beds and not enough staff.\"\nAnd without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get \"back on track\".\nThe concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third.\nAs with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. \nAnd if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic.\nSurveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable.\nDr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. \nShe says workforce shortages are now at \"critical\" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon.\n\"The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kristina Gray\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "title": "Indian variant: Second jabs could be brought forward to tackle rise",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Second vaccine doses could be brought forward and local restrictions introduced to help tackle the Indian variant in the worst-affected areas, the UK  government has said. \nMinister Nadhim Zahawi said steps could also include vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households.\nMeanwhile, a top scientist has warned lifting restrictions on 21 June is in doubt because of the Indian variant. \nCases in the UK have more than doubled to 1,313, Public Health England said. \nThe figures released on Thursday have risen from 520 cases recorded by PHE up to 5 May.\nMost of the cases - 1,255 - are in England, while there are 35 in Scotland, 12 in Northern Ireland and 11 in Wales, according to PHE. \nHowever, Prof Paul Hunter, who sits on a number of Covid advisory committees for the World Health Organization, said current figures were around two weeks out of date and would now be higher. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Indian variant was now in most regions of the UK, with the possible exception of Yorkshire and Humber and north-east England. \nMore than 30% of cases are in London, followed by 25% in north-west England, 12% in eastern England, 10% in the East Midlands and 8% in the South East, PHE said.\nFour people have now died with the Indian variant of concern as of 12 May, according to PHE. \nAccording to Friday's government figures, a further 17 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test and another 2,193 coronavirus cases have been recorded.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said there was \"no firm evidence yet to show this variant has any greater impact on severity of disease or evades the vaccine\".\nBut experts believe it may be more transmissible.\nAnd the department said ministers could not rule out imposing local restrictions if they were necessary to suppress a variant which vaccines are less effective against. \nVaccines Minister Mr Zahawi said the government was also considering reducing the gap between vaccine doses for people in areas where the variant is spreading. \nHe added that pilots of vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households in Luton had been successful.\nProf Hunter said there was \"possibly\" a case for targeting vaccines in certain areas - but jabs took two to three weeks to work. This would mean diverting doses from other areas, where the Indian variant could also soon be spreading. \nHe added that he thought it was more important to administer as many first doses as possible than boost the number of second doses at this stage. \nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no evidence to suggest England's planned lockdown easing could not go ahead.\nThe next major easing of restrictions is due to take place on 17 May.\nBut Prof Hunter said step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, which is due on 21 June and would see all legal limits on social contact lifted, \"is in doubt\". \nCurrently, he said the Indian variant was spreading in younger, unvaccinated people but if cases increased in the elderly so would hospital admissions, putting pressure on the NHS. \nMr Zahawi said easing restrictions on 21 June depended on the government's four tests being met - including that vaccines continue to be effective and the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants. \nWhy could the Indian variant be a problem when the vaccination programme is doing so well?\nThe issue is that we are only part way through even though those most at risk have been prioritised.\nThere is still debate about how transmissible the new variant is.\nBut modelling by the University of Warwick has estimated that a 30%-40% more transmissible variant combined with relaxing restrictions in May and June could lead to more hospital admissions than in the first wave.\nIt would be a very different situation if we were in the autumn when overall levels of immunity would be making it harder for the virus to spread.\nInstead, we are in the delicate phase where restrictions are being eased as the vaccine is taking over the burden of suppressing the virus.\nOne option being considered is closing the gap between the first and second doses.\nThis would give vulnerable people, who have already been offered their first jab, extra protection more quickly.\nHowever, there could be a trade-off as studies suggest the current 12-week gap between doses leads to a better immune response than the originally planned three-week gap.\nAsked whether local lockdowns were being considered, Mr Zahawi said nothing was \"off the table\", including further regional or national measures. \nHowever, he said surge testing was the \"most effective way\" of dealing with variants. \nSurge testing is already taking place in 15 areas across England, including Bolton, Blackburn, London, Sefton and Nottingham.\nThis is when increased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in specific locations to try to prevent the spread of outbreaks.\nGreater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told BBC Breakfast local lockdowns \"can't be the answer\" and urged ministers to deliver more vaccines to areas where case rates are highest. \nThe Conservative leader of Bolton Council, David Greenhalgh, also appealed to the government not to enforce a local lockdown, saying people would simply travel to pubs and restaurants in neighbouring areas. \nHe said he had also asked the health secretary for more resources and vaccines, including for younger people, to tackle the surge. \nMr Greenhalgh said talks on the introduction of vaccines for younger age groups had been \"very constructive\" and \"all the soundings\" were that the government was looking to progress this as soon as possible. \nPHE said mobile testing units had been set up in Bolton, and door-to-door PCR testing had been offered to 22,000 residents. A PCR test is the most accurate way to check for Covid.\nMore doses have been delivered to the town, which has also set up a vaccine bus to increase uptake among those who are eligible. \nExtra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week to offer the vaccine to those who are eligible under national guidelines.\nBut the area's public health director, Prof Dominic Harrison, said he was \"furious\" the government had refused a request to extend vaccinations in Blackburn. \nOn Thursday, the council initially said all over-18s would be offered a jab, before later stating only those with underlying conditions could book an appointment.\nMeanwhile, the R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen slightly from between 0.8 and 1.0 to between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. \nIf the R number is above one then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nAdditional reporting by Hazel Shearing"

      "title": "Israel-Gaza violence: The strength and limitations of Hamas' arsenal",
      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Hamas",
      "text": "While death, damage and suffering have been caused to both sides in the escalating hostilities between Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli military, this remains a hugely asymmetric struggle.  \nIsrael is the vastly more powerful player and its air force, armed drones and intelligence-gathering systems enable it to strike targets in Gaza pretty much at will. It insists that its targeting is restricted to sites used for military purposes but the density of the Palestinian population and the fact that Hamas and Islamic Jihad facilities are located close to, and often hidden under, civilian buildings makes the avoidance of civilian casualties altogether impossible. \nHamas and Islamic Jihad, though the weaker parties, have weapons enough with which to attack Israel. They have already tried a variety of tactics. Israeli defences shot down a drone - possibly armed - that had sought to cross into Israel from Gaza. And an Israeli military spokesman said an \"elite Hamas unit\" had attempted to infiltrate Israel through a tunnel from the southern part of the strip. The Israeli military, it seems, had advance warning of this and, according to the spokesman, was able to \"cause the tunnel to implode\".\nBut by far and away the most significant weaponry in the Palestinians' arsenal is their wide variety of ground-to-ground missiles. Some of these (along with other systems employed like the Kornet guided anti-tank missiles used during recent days), are believed to have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula. \nBut by far the bulk of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad arsenals come from a dynamic and relatively sophisticated manufacturing capability inside the Gaza Strip itself. Israeli and outside experts believe that Iranian know-how and assistance have played a significant role in building up this industry. Accordingly, weapons manufacturing and storage sites have been among the chief targets of the Israeli strikes.\nEstimating the stockpile of Hamas missiles is impossible.\nIt certainly includes many thousands of weapons of varying ranges. Clearly the Israeli military has its own estimates that it is not willing to share. All a spokesman would say was that they believed Hamas could sustain this level of fire for \"a significant period of time\".  \nThe Palestinians are employing a variety of missiles, none of which, so far, appear to be especially new in terms of basic design. But the overall trend is for the weapons to have increased ranges and larger explosive payloads.   \nWhile the names and designations of specific missiles can be a bit confusing, Hamas has a huge inventory of shorter-range systems like the Qassam (up to 10km or 6 miles) and the Quds 101 (up to about 16km); bolstered by the Grad system (up to 55km); and the Sejil 55 (up to 55km). These probably make up the bulk of its inventory and for the shortest ranges can be bolstered by mortar fire. \nBut Hamas also operates a variety of longer-range systems like the M-75 (up to 75km); the Fajr (up to 100km); the R-160 (up to 120km); and some M-302s which have a range of up to 200km. So it is clear that Hamas has weapons that can target both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and threaten the whole coastal strip which contains the greatest density of Israel's population and critical infrastructure.   \nThe Israeli military says that of the more than 1,000 or so rockets fired into Israel over the past three days, some 200 have actually fallen short in the Gaza Strip itself (perhaps an indicator of the problems of a home-grown and dispersed weapons manufacturing process). \nThe IDF also say 90% of all missiles reaching Israel have been intercepted by their Iron Dome anti-missile system. However, at one stage the battery defending the city of Ashkelon appears to have been off-line due to a technical malfunction, underlining that for all its remarkable technical success, this is not a missile-proof screen. \nTo counter missile fire you only really have a limited number of options. You can employ anti-missile defences. You can target stockpiles and manufacturing facilities. You could in theory also mount a ground operation to push the missile-launchers back beyond effective range. \nThat is not going to be possible in this case. Part of the Palestinians' vulnerability is that they have no strategic depth and nowhere to go. A ground operation to stifle the missile fire is possible. But as was shown in Israel's last major incursion into Gaza in 2014, the human cost would be considerable. During the operation, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed, while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.\nThis repeating cycle of rocket-fire, response and incursion gets neither side anywhere. At best, it buys a period of calm before the next round begins. Many might argue that it was the tensions in Jerusalem that started this particular episode. A signal once again that the Israel-Palestinian dispute cannot be ignored forever. \nBut with more and more Arab governments making their peace with Israel; with the Palestinians politically as divided as ever; and with this issue being far from the agenda of Israel's current leadership, it is hard to see how any progress towards a real peace can be made. For that you would need a real desire for progress on the ground and a strong and sustained effort by outside players. The conditions for this just do not appear to be there. \nJonathan Marcus is a foreign affairs analyst and former defence and diplomatic correspondent for BBC News"

minister restated the government's intention to deliver a way forward in Northern Ireland that focuses on reconciliation, delivers for victims of the Troubles and ends the cycle of reinvestigations. \n\"He stressed the importance of working hard to keep the gains made through the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and of all parties doing their utmost to help the victims' families find out what happened to their loved ones, so that future generations are not burdened by the past.\"\nBriege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the prime minister's apology \"means nothing\".\n\"I don't care about an apology, I want to know why [our loved ones were killed],\" she told the BBC.\nShe added it would have been \"more respectful\" for Mr Johnson to make the apology in parliament, rather than through a phone call.\nThere are real question marks over the nature of how this apology was issued.\nNot by the prime minister at the despatch box in parliament, nor to the families who had been calling for a direct, public apology, but in a readout from Number 10 after a private meeting with Stormont's first and deputy first ministers.\nPart of the confusion is that the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in statements giving their version of the call make no reference to any apology from Boris Johnson.\nUltimately, only the politicians who took part in the call and their advisers know exactly what was said, and how it was said.\nThere is speculation that Brandon Lewis's planned statement to the Commons on Thursday about the inquest's findings will include a public apology.\nGiven the underwhelming response from the families to the prime minister's words and how this has been handled so far, they may not take much more comfort from what the government says next.  \nA Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said the first and deputy first ministers were told that Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis would make a statement on Ballymurphy on Thursday. \nThey said: \"Michelle O'Neill put it to Boris Johnson that he should apologise to the families of those killed in Ballymurphy by British state forces. \n\"After 50 years of cover-up and lies they have been vindicated and their innocence declared. \n\"She challenged attempts by his government to deny the Ballymurphy families, or any other access to justice now or in the future.\"\nMs O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president, had previously described an apology as the \"bare minimum\" required by the government.\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said: \"I would encourage the British government to respond in a comprehensive and fulsome way to the finding that 10 completely innocent people were shot and killed.\"\nHe added: \"I would encourage them to understand the depth of the pain and grief felt by the families and how that pain and grief was compounded by the untruths that were told about their loved ones.\n\"This should be done in a manner that respects the wishes of these families.\"\nAlliance Party MP Stephen Farry said it was \"helpful\" that the government was \"prepared to apologise\", however, he added a statement needed to be made in parliament on Thursday.\n\"The scope of apology needs to be scrutinised to ensure it covers all aspects,\" he continued.\nSDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole tweeted it was \"utterly repugnant\" for the prime minister to believe it was an \"appropriate manner\" to issue a statement on the shootings through a spokesperson.

      "text": "Online retail giant Amazon has said it is hiring 75,000 workers across the US and Canada to meet growing demand as the pandemic continues.\nThe new jobs offered across transport and its warehouses will be permanent roles.\nIt will also offer new staff who have already been vaccinated against Covid-19 a $100 (\u00a371.19) bonus, it said in a statement.\nA spokesperson said the firm had an \"unwavering commitment to safety\".\nThe retailer said that the jobs, which are already being advertised, will offer average starting pay of $17 per hour - following recent wage increases it introduced.\nAmazon also said it would offer sign-on bonuses of up to $1,000 in some locations to attract new staff. \nFigures released last week showed that the US economy added far fewer jobs than expected in April, with some analysts saying that firms were finding it harder to recruit people.\nAmazon now employs more than one million workers worldwide, having gone on a huge hiring spree during the pandemic. In the UK, for example, it added 10,000 jobs last year.\nAs consumers stayed at home during lockdown, the retailer had its most lucrative year to date in 2020. But it also faced allegations over poor working conditions, as well strikes at warehouses in the US, Italy and Germany.\nThe Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which organised an effort in Alabama to form the first unionised Amazon warehouse in the US, hit out after the latest hiring announcement.\nStuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU, said: \"Amazon has to keep hiring because of the extraordinary turnover at all of its warehouses. \n\"No matter what they pay people, it doesn't compensate for the way they treat people and the unsatisfactory working conditions at Amazon facilities - and people keep leaving these jobs.\"\nAmazon has insisted that it ensures workers' health and safety.\nIn many of its US warehouses across Missouri, Nevada and Kansas, it has organised on-site vaccination events as the rate of jabs being delivered has slowed in recent weeks. \nOther companies have also sought to promote Covid vaccinations.\nMcDonald's announced on Tuesday that in the US it would start printing \"We can do this\" slogans, alongside links to websites with further information about vaccines, on its coffee cups.\nConsumer giant Unilever will also be giving away milkshakes and ice creams to healthcare workers and those getting vaccinated across several US sites on 14 May."

      "tags": "US economy,Transport,Oil,United States",
      "text": "The operator of the biggest fuel pipeline in the US announced it would resume operations on Wednesday evening after a five-day closure.\nA ransomware cyber-attack forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down the main part of its network on Friday.\nThe 5,500-mile (8,900km) pipeline usually carries 2.5 million barrels a day on the East Coast. \nThe closure saw supplies tighten across the US, with prices rising and a number of states declaring an emergency. \nColonial Pipeline warned in a press release that it could take several days for the delivery supply chain to return to normal. \n\"Some markets served by Colonial Pipeline may experience, or continue to experience, intermittent service interruptions during the start-up period,\" they added in a statement. \nThe FBI has accused a criminal gang called DarkSide of being behind the ransomware attack. \nColonial has said it will not pay the ransom demanded by the hackers. \nUS petrol prices rose on Wednesday as motorists queued to fill up their cars on the sixth day of the Colonial Pipeline shutdown.\nThe average price per gallon hit $3.008 (\u00a32.14) - the highest level seen since October 2014, according to the Automobile Association of America.\nA spokeswoman said that the shutdown and \"fluctuating demand\" had led to higher prices.\nThe pipeline operator said on Wednesday that it had restarted operations, but it warned that it would \"take several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal\". \nGovernors in the states of Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia have all declared states of emergency, which mean they can introduce temporary rules to ease prices in their areas as a result.\nFor many people, the image of the oil industry is one of pipes, pumps and greasy black liquid.\nIn truth, the type of modern operation Colonial Pipeline runs is extremely digital.\nPressure sensors, thermostats, valves and pumps are used to monitor and control the flow of diesel, petrol and jet fuel across hundreds of miles of piping.\nAll this operational technology is connected to a central system - and where there is connectivity, there is a risk of cyber-attack.\nAccording to data collated by tracking firm GasBuddy, at least 3,500 petrol stations had run dry across Virginia, North Carolina and and several other states on Wednesday. \nVirginia and Georgia were among the worst-affected, with more than 40% of petrol stations it monitors suffering from outages, it said on its website. In North Carolina, 65% of petrol stations had fuel outages.\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said earlier in the week that the firm Colonial could make a decision on restarting operations on Wednesday. She did caution, however, that the full pipeline might not be active for days after that. \nDespite the government's appeal to consumers not to panic-buy, many motorists have been seen queuing to fill up their cars. \n#GasShortage2021 was also trending on social media, with some joking that they were reminded of the run on toilet paper seen at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis.\nOthers posted photos which appeared to show customers filling up plastic bags with petrol. \nUS Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday that the Biden administration was \"working around the clock\" to help deal with any shortages.\n\"This is a time to be sensible and to be safe, of course we understand the concern in areas where people are encountering temporary supply disruptions,\" he said.\n\"But hoarding does not make things better, and under no circumstances should gasoline ever be put into anything but a vehicle directly or an approved container, and that of course remains true no matter what else is going on.\" \nThe White House also said officials were considering new ways to alleviate any shortages, such as extending working hours for those transporting fuel."

      "text": "A Metropolitan Police officer who pretended to stop and search drug dealers so he could steal their money has been jailed for eight years.\nKashif Mahmood seized hundreds of thousands of pounds for an organised crime gang controlled from Dubai. \nThe gang received information about when money was on the move so that Mahmood could intercept it - in uniform - using police cars.\nFour other men and a woman received sentences of up to 16 years.\nThe sentences follow an investigation which benefited from the penetration of the Encrochat mobile phone network in 2020.\nPassing sentence, His Honour Judge Tomlinson said Kashif Mahmood had abused his position of \"power, trust and responsibility\".\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick called the case \"shocking\" but said she was \"delighted\" the Met's anti corruption officers \"were able to mount this operation and to catch those people and to actually have a big impact on an organised criminal network\". \nOf corrupt officers, Dame Cressida added: \"They betray the rest of us and we deplore this form of corruption or any corruption.\"\nThe defendants pleaded guilty to offences including acquiring criminal property, money laundering and drug supply.\nIt was a sophisticated criminal operation based on tip-offs from a shadowy figure in Dubai, named in court as Mutjaba Neazmand.  \nUsing the code name \"SSNew\" on the Encrochat network, the court heard he was involved in large-scale drug dealing, but also directing gang members to \"steal back\" the proceeds. \nNeazmand would contact the gang's leader in the UK, Mohsin Khan, with information about \"jobs\" - large amounts of money being carried by drug couriers.\nKhan, whose Encrochat nickname was \"AcquaPlus\" would pass on the details to police officer Kashif Mahmood, who had served in the Met for 10 years. \nMahmood would book out police cars from Stoke Newington Police station, and pick up an accomplice, Ioan Gherghel, to pose as his partner. \nBacked up by Khan and his two brothers, they would then try to stop the couriers and \"seize\" their money. \nOften the couriers had been given the cash by the Khan gang as part of a drug deal.  \nWhen it was stolen back by the Khans and Mahmood, they were left out of pocket, and at risk of reprisals from their criminal associates. \nThe scam was so successful the gang seized more than a million pounds, prosecutors believe.  \nBy March 2020 \"SSNew\" or Neazmand, the mastermind in Dubai, was boasting in Encrochat messages that: \"We can do 1500m and I still say to u bro we do more.\"\n\"This system is in our hand. We can do it unlimited.\" \nPolice say Encrochat was almost exclusively used by criminals who communicated freely, believing their conversations were encrypted.\nIt was penetrated by French police and intelligence agency cyber security experts in early 2020, and, as a result, more than 1,500 suspects have been arrested so far. \nThe Khan gang were caught following a number of \"jobs\", including one where they inadvertently targeted a drug courier, while he was under police surveillance. \nProsecutors believe the gang had handed him half a million pounds, in return for drugs.\nMahmood and Gherghel, also dressed as police officers, then stopped the man's car in Chingford, East London, searched it, and took the money back.  \nThis meant that the gang now had both the cash and the drugs. \nBut surveillance officers belonging to a police proactive money laundering team were, by chance, watching what happened.  \nThey stopped Mahmood to find out why the search of the target's car had been carried out, and requested he create an intelligence report. \nMahmood's body worn video camera was inadvertently triggered and captured pictures of Gherghel, dressed as a police officer and sitting in the police car with him\n\nProsecutors said Mahmood was forced to go to his police station, despite being signed off on sick leave to complete the report.  \nIt was used by police as evidence against him. \nThey also analysed extensive mobile phone evidence to build up a picture of the gang's communications and movements. \nFollowing arrests, large amounts of cash were found in the conspirators' homes. \nMaria Shah, a partner of one of the gang, and also convicted of being involved, is believed to have withdrawn a large amount of cash from a safety deposit box facility in Knightsbridge, central London.  \nWhen police searched the boxes they were found to be empty. \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct, which worked to ensure the investigation was thorough and impartial, called Mahmood's behaviour \"audacious corrupt and criminal\". \n\"His actions were a complete betrayal of public trust and confidence and have no place in policing,\" said the IOPC's director of major investigations, Steve Noonan.\n\"While all the evidence we have seen points towards this being an isolated case of police corruption... we have to remain vigilant and will continue to pursue allegations of corruption vigorously.\""

      "text": "Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, is to serve the rest of his life sentence in a British jail.\nThe Foreign Office said he would be transferred to a UK prison from a UN detention unit in the Netherlands.\nKaradzic, 75, was also found guilty at his 2016 criminal tribunal of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nHis original 40-year sentence was increased at an appeal hearing in 2019.\nHis conviction for genocide related to his responsibility for the murder of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. \nIt was considered one of the worst massacres in Europe since World War Two.\nJudges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia also held Karadzic responsible for the siege of Sarajevo, a campaign of shelling and sniping which lasted more than three years and led to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 civilians.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"Radovan Karadzic is one of the few people to have been found guilty of genocide...\n\"We should take pride in the fact that, from UK support to secure his arrest, to the prison cell he now faces, Britain has supported the 30-year pursuit of justice for these heinous crimes.\"\nMr Raab described Srebrenica as \"the darkest moment in European history since the Holocaust\".\n\"I think we have got a moral duty and I think we have a sense of national purpose in trying to hold to account the perpetrators of the very worst crimes,\" Mr Raab said.\n\"Back since Nuremburg [the trials of Nazi leaders in the German city after World War Two] we have played that role.\"\nHe added: \"If we want to deter these kind of crimes from happening, if we want to give justice to the many thousands of victims, I think it is right we do our bit.\" \nThe UK was one of the signatories to enforcement agreements with the United Nations for sentences passed by its tribunals related to the former Yugoslavia.\nUN officials confirmed they had asked the UK to \"enforce the sentence\".\nThey did not provide a date for the move but said \"all necessary measures\" should be taken \"to facilitate Karadzic's transfer... as expeditiously as possible\".\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia stemmed from tensions among ethnic groups, following the death of President Tito in 1980.\nCalls for more autonomy led in 1991 to declarations of independence in Croatia and Slovenia and fighting with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army. \nBosnia, with a complex mix of Serbs, Muslims and Croats, was next to try for independence. Bosnia's Serbs, backed by Serbs elsewhere in Yugoslavia, resisted.\nKaradzic, a former psychiatrist, was president of the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War in the 1990s.\nAfter the war, he hid for years - masquerading as an expert in alternative medicine - before his eventual arrest in Serbia in 2008.\nIn November 2017, former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic was sentenced to life in prison on similar charges of war crimes and genocide. A ruling in an appeal against his conviction is to be announced next month in The Hague.\nBritain was involved in the hunt, trial and conviction of Radovan Karadzic. And now it is taking responsibility for enforcing the sentence handed down to him. \nBritish intelligence played a role in his capture in Belgrade in 2008 after 13 years on the run. British judges and lawyers were involved in the trial against him at a United Nations tribunal that the UK helped to set up. \nOne of the young lawyers who drafted the legal procedure to transfer Karadzic to the UK was a certain Dominic Raab, who is now the Foreign Secretary - and who ultimately agreed to the request from the UN that the former Bosnian Serb leader should serve out his term in a British jail. \nOfficials say the reason the UK agreed is because it is on the list of UN members willing to detain those found guilty of global crimes, and it wished to show its continued support for the international rules-based order. \nThe UK will bear the costs of Karadzic's detention but any decision about whether he is released before his death would be a matter for the UN authorities in The Hague. \nKaradzic will not be the first foreign national convicted of war crimes to have been held in a UK prison.\nFive men convicted of war crimes by the tribunals for the former Yugoslavia have been sent to British high-security prisons in the past. \nThey included former Bosnian-Serb general Radislav Krstic, who was stabbed by three Muslim prisoners at Wakefield jail in 2010 in apparent retaliation for Srebrenica.\nKrstic was moved to a prison in Poland in 2014.\nThe UK had also offered to jail the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, when he was on trial in The Hague on charges of war crimes and genocide. But he died in 2006 before the legal proceedings were completed.\nIn a separate arrangement, ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor is serving a 50-year war sentence in the UK following a war crimes conviction by a UN-backed special court, for aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war."

      "text": "A man is pulled from his car by an angry mob and severely beaten near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. As he lies motionless on the ground he is hit repeatedly in the head. The crowd eventually leaves him lying in the middle of the road.\nIn Acre, a car is attacked with rocks. When the driver tries to flee he is kicked to the curb and beaten with sticks as he tries to cover his head with his hands.\nAs Palestinian militants fired rockets from Gaza and Israel carried out air strikes on Wednesday night, rival Jewish and Israeli Arab mobs attacked businesses, cars and people in cities across Israel. Police reportedly arrested more than 400 people.\nPoliticians from all sides and parties have condemned the civil unrest. In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as \"intolerable\". \n\"Nothing justifies lynching Arabs among Jews, and nothing justifies lynching Jews among Arabs,\" he said, adding that the country was fighting a battle \"on two fronts\". \nOn Thursday, Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a \"massive reinforcement\" of border police forces to be deployed in cities across Israel to help tackle the unrest.\nAmid a wave of unrest gripping the country, two incidents on Wednesday night caused the most outrage.\nCamera crews broadcast the moment live on public television when a crowd of Jewish Israelis attacked a driver in Bat Yam, a coastal city just south of Tel Aviv.\nAfter vandalising Arab-owned property in the city - including the ice cream parlour Victory - the mob turned on the driver on the beachfront promenade. While they said the man was trying to ram them in his car, camera footage shows him trying to reverse away from and then speed past the violent crowd. \n\"We're watching a lynching in real time,\" the reporter said off camera. \"There are no police here.\"\nPolice reportedly did not arrive at the scene for 15 minutes after the assault. The man - thought to be an Arab - is \"seriously injured but stable\", according to Tel Aviv's Ichilov hospital.\nThe attack brought condemnation from all sides. Far-right Jewish politician Betzalel Smotrich said he was \"ashamed\" of the attack's \"atrocious cruelty\" while Issawi Fredj, Arab lawmaker for the left-wing Meretz party, said it was a sign the country was heading for \"civil war\".\nThe Times of Israel reports that Jewish mobs also took to the streets of Haifa and Tiberias, with chants of \"Death to Arabs\" reported. An Arab was stabbed in the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem, the newspaper said. \nIsraeli Arab mobs meanwhile were reported in cities including Jerusalem, Haifa, Tamra, and Lod, where the government imposed a state of emergency after violence there on Tuesday night. \nA Jewish man in his 30s is now reportedly in a serious condition at the Galilee Medical Center after Israeli Arabs attacked a driver in Acre. Police said they were armed with sticks and rocks, and footage reportedly from the scene shows a group chasing and beating the man on the ground as he tries to protect himself.\n\"We were near the area when we saw the wounded man lying unconscious and suffering from a bleeding head injury,\" a medic told the Jerusalem Post. \"We immediately began life-saving medical treatment that included bandaging and breath support and evacuated him in stable condition for further treatment at the hospital.\"\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid condemned the violence, which he described as a \"complete loss of control\".\n\"Jewish and Arab rioters declared war on Israel,\" he said in a series of tweets. \n\"The rioters in Lod and Acre do not represent Israeli Arabs, the rioters in Bat Yam... do not represent Israeli Jews,\" he wrote. \"The extremists will not ruin our lives.\"\nIn total, about 21% of Israel's population are Israeli Arabs - some 1.96 million people, according to a December report by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. \nDuring the war that surrounded the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, hundreds of thousands of Arabs were forced from or fled their homes. Those who stayed in what became Israel, and their descendants, have been granted citizenship and are known as Israeli Arabs.\nAbout 80% of Israeli Arabs are Muslim, with the rest identifying as either Christian or Druze. Most identify strongly with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, with many calling themselves \"Palestinian citizens of Israel\".\nIsrael's government says its Arab citizens have equal social and political rights, although they are exempt from compulsory military service. \nBut Israeli Arabs themselves say they are treated as second-class citizens who face legal, institutional and social discrimination."

      "tags": "Gaza border clashes,Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Jerusalem",
      "text": "A ceasefire was agreed on 21 May between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. \nIt came after 11 days of fighting, which left at least 255 people dead. Most of those killed were Palestinians in the territory of Gaza.\nIsrael and Hamas both claimed victory in the latest conflict. \nThe violence in May followed a month of rising tensions in Jerusalem. But the fighting has gone on for decades.\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine after the ruler of that part of the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in World War One. \nThe land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority. \nTensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave Britain the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. \nFor Jews it was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust of World War Two.\nViolence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also grew.\nIn 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. \nThat plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.\nIn 1948, unable to solve the problem, British rulers left and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the state of Israel.\nMany Palestinians objected and a war followed. Troops from neighbouring Arab countries invaded.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\".\nBy the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. \nJordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. \nJerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.\nBecause there was never a peace agreement - with each side blaming the other - there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.\nIn another war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.\nMost Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nNeither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank, and although it pulled out of Gaza the UN still regards that piece of land as occupied territory. \nIsrael claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.\nIn the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in these areas, where more than 600,000 Jews now live.\nPalestinians say these are illegal under international law and are obstacles to peace, but Israel denies this.\nTensions are often high between Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. \nGaza is ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has fought Israel many times. Israel and Egypt tightly control Gaza's borders to stop weapons getting to Hamas. \nPalestinians in Gaza and the West Bank say they are suffering because of Israeli actions and restrictions. Israel says it is only acting to protect itself from Palestinian violence.\nThe threatened eviction of some Palestinian families in East Jerusalem has also caused rising anger.\nThere are a number of issues which Israel and the Palestinians cannot agree on. \nThese include: what should happen to Palestinian refugees; whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed; whether the two sides should share Jerusalem; and - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel. \nPeace talks have been taking place on and off for more than 25 years, but so far have not solved the conflict.\nIn short, the situation isn't going to be sorted out any time soon.\nThe most recent peace plan, prepared by the United States when Donald Trump was president, was called \"the deal of the century\" by Israel's then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But it was been dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.\nAny future peace deal will need both sides to agree to resolve complex issues.\nThe BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, says the latest round of violence in May was the fourth big war between Hamas and Israel since 2008.\nHe's seen previous wars end like this before: \"Similar things have been said by both sides in claiming victory and then essentially the seeds of the next conflict are sown.\n\"I can tell you one thing for certain - that if the status quo does not change favourably, there will be another round of this.\"\nCorrection 21st June 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the US as recognising Israel's claim to the whole of Jerusalem and this has been amended to instead explain that the US recognises the city as Israel's capital.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "text": "Trains taken out of service after cracks were found are to be reintroduced following \"rigorous safety checks\", the Rail Delivery Group says.\nSome of the Hitachi Class 800 trains have cracks on the lifting plate, but as this is used for maintenance and not passenger journeys, regulators have agreed they are safe to return.\nThere have been cancellations since 182 trains were pulled on Saturday. \nThe rail minister warned travellers to expect disruption for \"some time\".\nThe Rail Delivery Group said Great Western Railway and London North Eastern Railway (LNER) will now ramp up services, but timetables will still be affected.\nTravellers are being advised to continue to check with their operator before they travel.\nTrains with more severe cracks will remain with Hitachi for repair and, in the longer term, the manufacturer says all trains with cracks will be brought back to be repaired.\nAndrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised for the disruption and told the BBC: \"Over the coming days we'll see more trains available for service as we get ready for the service on Monday morning.\"\nAsked if he expected the majority of trains to be back next week, he said: \"It is still early days, we're still undertaking those inspections, but we're hopeful that we can ensure the maximum number of trains are available for service.\"\nHe said it was \"too early to say\" how much the disruption and repair work caused by pulling 182 trains out of service had cost.\nIn a statement, the Rail Delivery Group said Hitachi Rail, train operators and the government have agreed a \"service recovery plan\" to reintroduce more Class 800 and 385 trains after they were taken out of service on Saturday.\nBut it said trains on some routes may be less frequent than usual and train availability could vary.\nThe industry has put in place \"suitable criteria for the trains to meet before they can re-enter service\", the Rail Delivery Group said.\nRail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said he welcomed the news that \"many trains\" can return following safety checks.\n\"Trains should begin to return to service after further inspections have been carried out, helping to safely restore the reliable and punctual services on GWR and LNER that passengers deserve,\" he said.\n\"Safety is our absolute focus, which is why Hitachi will carry out a comprehensive daily testing regime on affected trains.\"\nHe said the next step would be for Hitachi to present its long-term repair plan for the fleet, which he expects \"shortly\".\n\"Whilst this long-term fix can partly be incorporated into the regular service pattern for these trains, we do expect disruption to services for some time to come, but hope passengers understand this work is essential to ensure these issues do not occur again,\" Mr Heaton-Harris said.\nGreat Western Railway is still advising customers not to travel, saying disruption is \"likely to continue for some time\".\n\"We have had to cancel many of our long-distance services and expect disruption to journeys to continue for the next few days,\" it said.\nMost GWR services from London Paddington were cancelled on Thursday.\nEast Coast mainline company LNER said it was running a reduced timetable \"which may change at short notice\".\nIts website is reporting delays on 20 services, including journeys between London Kings Cross and Edinburgh, on Thursday.\nIn Scotland, LNER is not running any trains between Edinburgh and Aberdeen or Inverness.\nIt said its tickets would be accepted with ScotRail and Transpennine Express until Friday.\nHull Trains and TransPennine Express were also affected by the problem with Hitachi Class 800 trains, but both operators said on Saturday afternoon their fleet could return after checks.\nAdditional reporting by Caroline Davies"

      "tags": "St Paul's Cathedral,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "St Paul's Cathedral may have to close permanently if more regular funding is not found, bosses have warned.\nThe world-famous London landmark relies almost entirely on tourist income from ticket sales and has seen its finances devastated by the pandemic.\nThe building's income dropped by 90% in 2020 as it remained shut. There has been a similar fall so far this year.\nDean of St Paul's, the Very Rev Dr David Ison, said \"big decisions\" were needed for the historic building.\nSt Paul's is facing its worst financial crisis in 300 years, according to those who run it.\nWhile it received \u00a33.3m from the government's \u00a31.57bn culture recovery fund, the annual running costs alone amount to \u00a38m per year even after a restructure.\nSome also fear visitor numbers will never return to pre-pandemic levels as countries around the world continue to grapple with Covid-19.\nDr Ison said the last year had involved a lot of \"crisis management\". He is worried about how the building can be future-proofed without being given some ongoing outside assistance.\n\"If we can't raise the resources to be able to employ the people to look after the building and pay for the heating and lighting, we would have to shut our doors,\" he said.\nNearly all the cathedral's reserves have been spent and although some staff have been furloughed, a restructure has seen almost 25% made redundant.\nThere are fears that the internationally renowned St Paul's Cathedral choir could also be at risk.\nAlongside 30 choirboys, it is made up of 12 professional singers who provide the different ranges enabling the choir to sing its repertoire.\nKnown as the Vicars Choral, the group has been in existence since the 13th Century but the cost of continuing to pay for the adult singers is in question.\nAndrew Carwood, St Paul's director of music, said other expenses mean they cannot be funded at the moment.\n\"We have to plan and it's irresponsible for me not to consider all the options but I'm going to do everything in my power - and I know that the cathedral is here to make sure we find an answer to the problem we face,\" he said.\nAlmost all renovation projects at the cathedral have also been shelved.\nOne critical project which has been cancelled is the replacement of large sections of the 7,000 sq m (75,300 sq ft) lead roof, some of which dates back to the time of Sir Christopher Wren, the architect of the cathedral.\nIn March 2020, at the same time as when the pandemic hit, a \u00a315m programme of works to replace the ageing lead roof was about to be put out to tender. \nBut that has been cancelled as the money set aside for the project has been spent to keep the cathedral afloat.\nOliver Caroe, the surveyor of fabric at St Pauls, said the building was \"rotting\" and his team currently have to patch things up and seal the gaps, but \"there's only so long you can do that for\".\n\"We have collections under these roofs, really precious objects, and there are buckets next to them, covered in plastic because the roof leaks,\" he explained.\n\"I think everyone would be shocked if this building ran into trouble. It is in trouble now.\"\nDr Ison said the Church of England has 16,000 churches and diocese to run and most of its income pays for clergy.\n\"These heritage buildings belong to all of us and the church has been the custodian for many generations, but the church no longer has the income to do that, it's just spread too thinly.\n\"We've got some big decisions in our country about our heritage and how we're going to manage that going forward,\" he said."

      "tags": "Elon Musk,Bitcoin,Tesla,Climate change,Cryptocurrency",
      "text": "Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin due to climate change concerns, its CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet. \nBitcoin fell by more than 10% after the tweet, while Tesla shares also dipped. \nTesla's announcement in March that it would accept the cryptocurrency was met with an outcry from some environmentalists and investors.\nThe electric carmaker had in February revealed it had bought $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) of the world's biggest digital currency.\nBut on Thursday, it backtracked on its previous comments. \n\"We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\" Mr Musk wrote.\n\"Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\" \nHe also said the electric carmaker would not sell any of its Bitcoin, and intends to use it for transactions as soon as mining shifts to using more sustainable energy.\nMarket analysts see the move as an attempt by Tesla to assuage the concerns of investors who are focused on climate change and sustainability.\n\"Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues are now a major motivation for many investors. Tesla, being a clean energy-focused company, might want to work better in the environmental area of ESG,\" Julia Lee from Burman Invest told the BBC.\n\"But a cynic might suggest that this is just another move by Elon Musk to influence the cryptocurrency market, as he has done on so many other occasions,\" she added.\nElon Musk is hardly ill-informed when it comes to both technology and the environment. When I interviewed him in 2016 he spoke passionately about Tesla's mission to make transport sustainable in the battle against the \"existential threat\" of climate change.\nSo it is somewhat surprising that he has only just woken up to the fact that Bitcoin is not exactly a green project. Cambridge University's Centre for Alternative Finance runs a Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Right now, it shows that the process of mining the cryptocurrency - which involves using vast amounts of computer processing power - uses more electricity each year than Malaysia or Sweden and is closing in on the annual consumption of Egypt. \nBitcoin enthusiasts insist that mining mainly involves renewable energy - in truth, the miners focus on whatever is cheapest and in China, where many of them are based, that is often electricity generated by coal.\nWhen he announced his grand cryptocurrency plans back in February - and made Tesla's chief financial officer \"Master of Coin\" - Elon Musk sparked a surge in the value of Bitcoin and the adoration of its fanatical devotees. Now with the price falling the chatrooms are full of the angry and disappointed  - many of them sporting the glowing eyes Bitcoin avatar - accusing their former hero of betrayal.\nA move which was hailed as signalling that Bitcoin was going mainstream has ended up showing just how volatile - and downright flaky - the whole cryptocurrency scene can be.\nLast month, Tesla announced profits for the first three months of the year were $438m, up from $16m last year, boosted by sales of Bitcoin and environmental credits.\nMr Musk has been one of the world's most high profile proponents of cryptocurrencies, often tweeting about Bitcoin and the once-obscure digital currency Dogecoin.\nHis tweets in recent months helped to turn Dogecoin, which was started as a social media joke, into the world's fourth-biggest cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin is created by miners using high-powered computers to compete against each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles.\nIt is an energy-intensive process that often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal.\nThe dominance of Chinese Bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to switch from cheap fossil fuels to more expensive renewable energy sources could mean there are few quick solutions to the emissions concerns over Bitcoin.\nChina accounts for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world, according to recent research.\nThe cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's 10 largest cities, the study found.\nThat is because those Bitcoin miners tend to use electricity produced with fossil fuels, primarily coal, for most of the year, only shifting to renewable energy, mostly hydropower, during the rainy summer months.\nSupporters of Bitcoin point out that the mainstream financial system, with its millions of workers and computers in air-conditioned offices, also uses large amounts of electricity, which is usually produced with fossil fuels.\nReporting by the BBC's Peter Hoskins "

      "text": "The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released a new report on climate change that had been delayed by the Trump White House since 2017.\nThe Climate Change Indicators report charts the extent to which glaciers are shrinking, sea levels are rising and flooding is increasing.\nThe impacts are being felt by Americans \"with increasing regularity\", it says.\nThe indicators showing mankind's role in climate change, had not been updated under former President Donald Trump.\nThe Climate Change Indicators website was regularly updated under his predecessor, Barack Obama.\nMr Trump has long been a sceptic of human-caused climate change, at times calling it a \"hoax\".\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement announcing the resumption of the survey: \"Combatting climate change - it's not optional. It's essential at EPA.\"\n\"We will move with a sense of urgency because we know what's at stake. \nThe report takes in data from dozens of US agencies, and shows the damage climate change has already caused.\nCoastal flooding is becoming more common, especially in cities along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Floods are now five times more common in the cities surveyed than in the 1950s.\nArctic sea ice is thinning, and the minimum extent of its coverage has been getting smaller each summer. September 2020 saw the second smallest amount of Arctic sea ice ever recorded.\nThe average decrease for that month amounts to about 900,000 sq miles (1,450,000 sq km) - \"a difference three and a half times the size of Texas\", the report says.\nOcean temperatures also hit a record-breaking high in 2020 and the water has grown more acidic over the past decade.\nWildfire season and pollen season are both starting earlier and lasting longer.\nHeat waves are occurring about three times more often than in the 1960s.\nThe amount of energy use in the summer has nearly doubled since 1973. In 2015, air conditioning accounted for 17% of the average American household's energy consumption. \nIncidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled since 1991. It comes as ticks, the blood-sucking insects that spread the virus, appear in regions such as parts of Canada where they were previously unable to survive the cold."

      "text": "BT says it is speeding up its rollout of full-fibre broadband to five million more households than previously planned in a move it says could create up to 7,000 jobs.\nBoss Philip Jansen told the BBC that BT is also bringing forward its deadline to complete the work, with 25 million homes now due to be connected by 2026.\n\"It's a massive programme - a \u00a315bn investment,\" he said. \nThe telecoms giant has been criticised for the pace of full-fibre rollout.\nBut BT said tax changes introduced on fibre broadband investment to homes and businesses allowed it to accelerate its strategy. \nMr Jansen added that the faster rollout could be done through joint ventures with other parties to share the work and investment with its Openreach operation, especially to speed up broadband access to people in rural areas.\nA number of European telecoms rivals and private equity investors are thought to have looked at trying to secure a slice of the UK's fast-growing broadband infrastructure.\nAccelerating the plans \"will help fuel UK economic recovery, with better connectivity and up to 7,000 new jobs\", Mr Jansen said.\nMany big companies use the Openreach network to provide their services, including TalkTalk and Sky, but have been critical of the pace of the rollout and prices.\nTalkTalk said it welcomed Thursday's announcement, but said that affordability and take-up of services was key. \"Whilst this [BT] commitment is great progress, it shouldn't hide the fact that the UK lags far behind other European nations in rolling out full fibre,\" a TalkTalk spokesperson said. \nBT news came as Britain's biggest broadband and mobile provider reported a 23% fall in full-year pre-tax profit to \u00a31.8bn, in large part due to a 7% fall in revenue to \u00a321.3bn.\nBT's profit was also eaten into by a bonus for frontline staff, increased cost of services and the continuing investment in the fibre network.\nBut Mr Jansen said he was confident about future trading: \"After a number of years of tough work, and as we look to build back better from the pandemic, we're now pivoting to consistent and predictable growth.\"\nAnd in a relief for shareholders, BT said it planned to bring back its dividend, which was suspended due to Covid, during the current financial year. \nSeparately, the Premier League has agreed to roll over its existing television deal for football rights with broadcasters, which include BT Sport.\nLast month, BT confirmed it was in talks with several companies about the future of its sports arm.\nOn Thursday, Mr Jansen said he was \"open-minded\" on options for its BT Sport, but added: \"It's very possible we make no changes at all, because BT Sport now has a very clear profile and we're happy with it.\n\"It's possible that we do some sort of partnership or joint venture, and of course it is possible that we don't end up with BT Sport because there's a better owner of it who can invest more than we will invest. But I think it's too early to call that right now.\""

      "tags": "Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Jerusalem",
      "text": "Israel has deployed tanks and troops to its border with Gaza, as it mulls whether to launch a ground operation in the territory after days of violence.\nConflict raged throughout Thursday as Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli army maintained a barrage of air strikes.\nMore than 100 people have been killed in Gaza and seven have died in Israel.\nJewish and Israeli Arab mobs have also been fighting within Israel, prompting the president to warn of civil war.\nDefence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a \"massive reinforcement\" of security forces to suppress the internal unrest, and more than 400 people were arrested.\nTwo infantry units and one armoured unit were positioned near the border with Gaza on Thursday. At least 7,000 army reservists have also been called up.\nNo decision has yet been made on whether to launch a ground operation. The Israeli army is expected to put forward plans for a possible offensive imminently, but it would need to be approved by army chiefs and various levels of government.\nThe four-days of violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It was initially fuelled by weeks of Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which led to clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. This spiralled into an incessant exchange of Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes.\nIn other developments on Thursday:\nAccording to the health ministry in Gaza, at least 103 people have been killed in the four-days of conflict. Officials in the territory, which is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas, many civilians have died including 27 children.\nIsrael says dozens of those killed in Gaza were militants, and that some of the deaths are from misfired rockets from Gaza.\nIn the Israeli city of Sderot, a young boy was killed when rocket fire from Gaza hit his home, and shrapnel penetrated the shelter he was hiding in.\nIsrael has also called up 10 reserve border patrol companies to help tackle the worst unrest between Arab and Jewish communities for many years. Political leaders have appealed for calm, and President Reuven Rivlin described the outbreaks of rioting in several towns and cities as \"senseless civil war\".\nThere have been widespread calls for de-escalation, including from Israel's ally the US, but little sign of the conflict easing. \nA senior Hamas official said the group was ready for a \"reciprocal\" ceasefire if the international community pressures Israel to \"suppress military actions\" at the disputed Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\nHowever, Israeli military spokesman Hilda Zilberman said Israel was not seeking a ceasefire at the current time, the Times of Israel reported.\nThe fear among civilians on both sides is taking its toll.\nNajwa Sheikh-Ahmad, a Gaza mother, said of Wednesday night: \"You cannot sleep... In any moment your home might be your grave.\n\"You cannot be secure. As a mother it's very terrifying, it's very exhausting for my feelings, for my humanity,\" she told the BBC's Today programme. \nIn Israel, an apartment block was destroyed in the city of Petah Tikva shortly after residents had gone to their bomb shelters.\n\"We heard an alarm and suddenly there was a bang. Smoke entered the shelter, and the neighbour next to me who was sitting on a chair flew back,\" one resident told the news website Ynet.\nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded.\nPalestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of Ramadan in mid-April.\nIt was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day.\nThe fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict.

      "tags": "Coronavirus public inquiry,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is \"fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage\" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nHe told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022.\nThe inquiry would place \"the state's actions under the microscope\", he added, and take evidence under oath.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021.\nBut addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not \"inadvertently distract\" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. \nThe inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in \"due course\", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. \nOn Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases.\nMr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the \"right moment\".\nHe said the \"new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here\".\n\"Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January.\"\nBolton has one of the highest instances of the Indian variant in the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s.\nHealth officials in Glasgow have expressed concern about a rising number of Covid cases in the city - the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. \nMore than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths.  \nThe inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. \nMr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a \"statutory basis\" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry.\nIn response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman \"will happen before the spring of next year\".\nMr Johnson - who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May - said: \"The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic.\"\nHe added: \"The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year.\"\nA WHO report released on Wednesday said the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. \nMost leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK.\nThe inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. \nKey questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only \"war-gamed\" a serious flu epidemic. \nWhy were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? \nWhy was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? \nThere will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. \nDifferent approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. \nThe biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. \nThe inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. \nThe Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were \"getting away from\u2026 early accountability\".  \nMeanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference.\nShe said spring 2022 was \"simply too late to begin\".\n\"It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year.\n\"A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter.\"\nAlong with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal \"lessons learned\" investigation into its handling of the pandemic.\nDowning Street confirmed an \"informal\" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published.\nFran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a \"rapid review\".\nShe told the BBC: \"That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would.\n\"That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions.\"\nDame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years.\"\nProfessor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry.\nHe told the BBC's Newscast podcast: \"What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise.\"\nIn the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic.\nHe added he \"wholeheartedly\" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as \"a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital\".\nIn response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was \"certainly\" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would \"say that with more clarity a bit later on\".\nEveryone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice.\nOn Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST.\nPregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers.\nMore than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab."

She left the cafe for the day, went home and changed before going to the bus stop to come and see me. \n\"Why would she be back at the cafe?\" \nOn Friday, officers were called in following suggestions a body may have been buried at the cafe on Southgate Street.\nGloucestershire Police said the force could be at the site \"for a number of weeks\".\nIn 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather. The confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women.\nHe and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three.\nWest took his own life in prison while awaiting a trial in 1995.\nRose's former lawyer Leo Goatley said it \"wouldn't surprise me if a body was found there\", adding the Wests often visited the cafe. \nBoth Mary and Fred West's first victim, Anne McFall, worked there.\n\"I've spoken to witnesses who have said that they may have seen Rose West there,\" he added.\nWest's biographer Geoffrey Wansell said the killer had never admitted to police he had killed her, but allegedly confessed to his solicitor, who was then sacked.\nMiss Bastholm's family are aware of recent developments and have asked for privacy.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Labour MP quits front bench over interfering in sexual harassment case",
      "text": "A Labour shadow minister has resigned her post after claims she tried to interfere in a sexual harassment case. \nKate Hollern has been accused of trying to \"scare\" away Tory MP Andrew Bridgen from helping the complainant. \nFormer Labour MP Mike Hill denies allegations of sexually harassing and bullying a female parliamentary worker.\nAt a tribunal into the case, Mr Bridgen said Ms Hollern told him there were rumours he was having an affair with the woman.\nHe claimed she added: \"If I were you I would keep away from her, because you have a wife and baby and you would not want to lose them if it got in the papers.\"\nA Labour spokesman confirmed Ms Hollern had resigned as the shadow minister for local government.\nIn a statement, she apologised for her \"error in judgement\", saying it was \"never my intention to undermine the support the complainant was receiving, which I was unaware of at the time\".\nIn response, Mr Bridgen said Ms Hollern \"really should have apologised to the victim\". \nThe Central London Employment Tribunal is currently hearing evidence into accusations made by a woman known only as Ms A against Mr Hill - who was the MP for Hartlepool. \nShe has accused him of carrying out a campaign of sexual harassment and bullying against her over a 16-month period while he was in office.\nThe 58-year-old resigned as an MP in March - sparking last week's by-election in the seat - but he has denied the allegations.\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Mr Bridgen - the MP for North West Leicestershire - said Ms A had confided in him, telling him she was allegedly being \"sexually harassed and sexually assaulted\".\nIn written evidence also submitted to the tribunal, he said he had advised Ms A to seek legal advice and that he approached the Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, to ask for advice too.\nBut later, he said Ms Hollern - the MP for Blackburn - had approached him while he sat on a terrace outside Parliament.\nIn his statement, Mr Bridgen wrote: \"Kate Hollern MP said 'everyone is saying in the Labour Party that you are having an affair with [Ms A] and if I were you I would keep away from her, because you have a wife and baby and you would not want to lose them if it got in the papers.'\n\"I told Kate Hollern MP 'this is rubbish.' In truth I was shocked, as Ms A is only a friend who asked me for some help and I regarded Kate Hollern MP's remarks as malicious and designed to scare me away from offering Ms A any help or support.\"\nAsked about it at Wednesday's hearing, Mr Bridgen said he believed she made the comments \"\"to isolate the applicant [Ms A] from any help and support\", which he thought was \"pretty appalling\". \nHe added: \"It was quite malicious and I don't respond well to intimidation like that I can assure you.\"\nThe tribunal also saw written evidence from Ms A that she had been approached by Ms Hollern at a later date, and Ms A confided in the Labour MP.\nMs A said the MP advised her to go on sick leave, adding: \"Ms Hollern advised me to save as much money as possible and in terms of the sexual harassment she said that many people in Parliament had put in complaints in the past of sexual harassment and nothing was ever done about it, which deterred me from seeking any further advice on this at that time.\" \nMs Hollern put out a statement on Wednesday in response to the allegations made at the tribunal.\nShe said: \"I am absolutely clear that any complaint of sexual harassment should be treated extremely seriously and had this been raised with me I would have taken the necessary action. \n\"It was never my intention to undermine the support the complainant was receiving, which I was unaware of at the time. \n\"If that is what Mr Bridgen was led to believe, I apologise for my error in judgement in having the conversation.\"\nAsked for a response to the apology on Wednesday, Mr Bridgen said: \"Kate Hollern resigned at 18:30 today and issued an apology to me through the Guardian newspaper. \n\"Ms Hollern really should have apologised to the victim Ms A.\"\nThe tribunal continues.

      "text": "Travel companies have been warned they must be ready to refund consumers if foreign holidays are cancelled by the coronavirus pandemic this summer.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said it had reminded package holiday firms of their legal obligations.\nIn 2020, cancelled trips resulted in 23,000 complaints to the competition watchdog.\nThe CMA said it had taken action against five big firms, which had now refunded a total of \u00a3200m.\nThese included Tui, which the watchdog said had now formally committed to giving clearer information about refunds upfront.\nThe others were Teletext Holidays, LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com and Virgin Holidays.\nThe UK government has said people can travel abroad again from 17 May, but destinations will be ranked for safety under a traffic light system and there are fears their status could change unexpectedly. \n\"We're calling on package holiday companies to make the refund process less hassle in the future,\" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. \n\"We expect all firms to give clear cancellation options and will consider appropriate steps if we see companies breaking the law by refusing or delaying refunds this summer.\"\nUnder package holiday rules, cancelled holidays must be refunded within 14 days and customers must be offered a refund, not just a credit note.\nSince the start of the pandemic, many people have faced last-minute cancellations of flights and holidays as travel restrictions were imposed.\nSome agreed to defer their holidays to a later date and accepted credit notes, but others who wanted their money back found it difficult to get refunds.\nAs the pandemic stretched on, others who had initially agreed to put off their holidays changed their minds and decided they did want a refund after all, but experienced reluctance from travel firms.\nThe CMA said any offer of a refund credit note had to be accompanied by the option of a full refund, while customers should be able to exchange their credit note for a refund at any time.\nFollowing customer complaints, the CMA has stepped in. It said at the end of last month that Teletext faced court action unless it paid more than \u00a37m in refunds.\nLastminute.com had been facing legal action in connection with \u00a31m worth of unpaid refunds, but the CMA said in February that the money had since been repaid.\nThe watchdog has now secured refund commitments from the other firms.\nPeople will be able to travel for leisure again from Monday, but holidays to most destinations require a period of quarantine when holidaymakers return home.\nPortugal is the main holiday destination currently on the \"green list\", but the travel industry is worried that countries could be added or withdrawn at short notice.\nThe government has advised against leisure travel to \"amber list\" countries, but Tui and EasyJet are still planning to offer holidays to some of those destinations.\nAn EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that many of our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday.\"\nShe added that EasyJet would not operate any holidays to destinations on the \"red\" list.\nOn Wednesday, online travel agent On The Beach said it had stopped selling all holidays for this summer because of Covid uncertainty.\nChief executive Simon Cooper told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been \"jaded by the experience\" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions.\nMr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by \"administrative costs and loss of goodwill\"."

      "tags": "Sewage,Plastic,Pollution,Plastic pollution,Water pollution",
      "text": "Untreated wastewater \"routinely released into UK rivers\" is creating microplastic hotspots on riverbeds. \nThat is the conclusion of a study in Greater Manchester, which revealed high concentrations of plastic immediately downstream of treatment works. \nThe team behind the research concluded: untreated wastewater was the \"key source\" of plastic pollution. \nThe water company that operates along the river the scientists studied said it didn't \"fully accept\" the findings. \nBut the scientists, who published their research in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Sustainability, say sewer overflow pipes and outflows from treatment plants can release millions of plastic particles in a day. \nLead researcher Prof Jamie Woodward from the University of Manchester told BBC News that, at the most contaminated site in the River Tame, where the team carried out their study, there were \"concentrations over 130,000 microplastic particles per kilogram of sediment on the riverbed\". \n\"So for every single gram of sediment, there were 130 particles - extraordinarily high levels of contamination.\n\"It's clear that wastewater is the key source of microplastics in our rivers.\"  \nWhile the water company, United Utilities, declined to be interviewed, Jo Harrison, the company's director of environment said in a statement: \"We understand that wastewater will be a contributing factor to microplastics pollution. We are involved in a wider two-year study, beginning this summer... to understand the sources and consequences of microplastics in the environment.\"\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the Environment Agency, which regulates the activities of the water industry added that the agency was \"aiding water industry research in this area\".\nWater companies are permitted to release untreated wastewater when the pipes in their plants are overwhelmed by excess rainwater. But the researchers say that they measured build-ups of plastic during a dry summer period.\n\"To produce such high levels of contamination, [they] must be releasing wastewater into low flows - so when there isn't heavy rain,\" said Prof Woodward.\n\"It's almost become routine for many water companies to do this.\"\nAn Environment Agency report published earlier this year seemed to confirm that conclusion, revealing that water companies discharged raw sewage into UK rivers 400,000 times in 2020. And a recent study using artificial intelligence to detect sewage spills showed that hundreds more releases were simply going unrecorded and unreported. \nCommenting on the recent study, Prof Andrew Johnson, from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in Wallingford, said that wastewater from sewer overflows was \"likely to be a source of microplastic flushes to rivers\". But, he added, \"we should not ignore all sorts of run-off from roads and fields adjacent to rivers\".\nAnd water industry body Water UK said that \"prevention was better than cure\". \"The public can play their part as well by not flushing wet wipes, and other single-use plastic items down the toilet,\" a spokesperson said. \nMicroplastics settle in the riverbed, which is the foundation of the river ecosystem, so researchers are concerned that this pollution accumulates exactly where it could do the most harm. Dr Rachel Hurley, at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research, said that the impact of microplastic pollution on rivers was a concern around the world. \n\"A lot of wastewater goes untreated globally,\" she said. \"And we know this wastewater concentrates many different types of microplastic in one place.\" \n\"We need to find out what the real reasons for these wastewater discharges are.\" \nFollow Victoria on Twitter\nHear more about this story on Inside Science on BBC Sounds"

      "text": "Historian Mary Beard is to fund scholarships for two disadvantaged students to study classics at Cambridge University, as a \"retirement present\".\nThe Cambridge professor is stepping down next year after almost 40 years of teaching and research.\nShe described the \u00a380,000 donation as her \"payback time\".\n\"I am very conscious of what I've gained from classics, no-one from my family had a university degree,\" said Dame Mary.\nThe historian and television presenter wants to help widen the reach of classics as a subject, so it's not \"just for posh people who've done Latin for ages\".\nMost people approaching retirement might expect the present to be heading in their direction, but Dame Mary - no stranger to doing things her own way - wants to mark her departure with her own donation.\n\"It's a pledge, that we really do want people from more diverse backgrounds to study classics. Classics is a subject that has changed, is changing, but needs to change more.\n\"But you still walk around the faculty and it looks, although not entirely, very white,\" said Dame Mary.\nThe funding, \u00a340,000 for each of two students, will help with living costs through their degree course, and will be available to students from low-income families or under-represented groups.\nDame Mary has not named the awards after herself, but after one of her classics tutors, Joyce Reynolds.\nShe said her former tutor at Cambridge, now aged 102, had been a \"fantastic fighter for the rights of women in what was then a very male subject\".\n\"I have no illusion that giving a couple of scholarships is the solution, but it's a way of showing we're serious about equality of opportunity,\" said Dame Mary.\nShe said classics students are \"trained to think hard, to express themselves, to write well - qualities that a hell of a lot of employers are looking for\".\nThe subject also offered a way of \"thinking about the world differently\", with different perspectives on philosophy, culture, gender and race.\nHer BBC television series, such as Julius Caesar Revealed and Mary Beard's Ultimate Rome: Empire Without Limit, have brought ancient history to a wider, modern audience.\nShe has also faced threats and abuse on social media, and what she's called \"sexist rants\" online.\nDame Mary said her own interest in classics was through an early enthusiasm for archaeology, and she remembers the excitement of finding a Roman coin and \"holding the past\".\nOne of her earliest memories, she said, was being taken by her mother to the British Museum as a small child, and an attendant being kind enough to open a display case to let her hold a piece of ancient Egyptian carbonised cake. \nShe now wants to help open up classics for another generation of young people.\nZaynab Ahmed, a current third-year classics student at Newnham College, Cambridge, said a barrier was the lack of state schools teaching the subject.\nShe said that was why the Cambridge four-year course was more accessible, with a foundation year to support students who might not have studied Latin at school.\n\"Classics is a subject I've fallen in love with. It's about the past, but it's also about how we understand ourselves now,\" she said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Concern is growing about a rising number of Covid cases in Glasgow as the area prepares to move down to level two.\nThe latest published case rate is 58.3 per 100,000 population - well above a key threshold for easing restrictions.\nA senior health official said there were clusters of high infection rates in parts of the city.\nThe so-called India variant is suspected to be involved, although this has yet to be confirmed.\nAll mainland council areas with the likely exception of Moray are due to move to level two on Monday. \nAttention has been focused on a surge in cases in Moray although this increase appears now to be slowing.  \nMoray's latest rate stands at 100.2 per 100,000 population, almost five times the Scotland-wide average, according to Public Health Scotland (PHS).\nGlasgow, however, has also seen a steady rise, and is now above 50 cases per 100,000 population -  one of the benchmarks for deciding if level two or level three restrictions are appropriate. Other factors taken into account include the ability of the local NHS to cope. \nScotland's clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, told BBC Scotland's The Seven that the case rate in Glasgow has been rising for the last five or six days. \nHe said he was concerned but he was confident Glasgow would still be able to move to level two as hospital admissions, intensive care and mortality remained low. \n\"The doesn't mean I'm complacent,\" he said. \"In fact I want to encourage people to follow the rules tonight, tonight over the weekend, into Monday and then the new rules on Monday. \n\"And any suggestion that people should gather in groups, or march or parade or anything that breaks rules - please don't do that because Glasgow is at a fragile moment.\"\nLinda de Caestecker, director of public health at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said she \"anticipated\" that Glasgow would still move to the lower level. \nBut she said officials were carefully monitoring case rates in particular districts such as Pollokshields and Battlefield in the south of the city.\nWhile the figures published by Public Health Scotland relate to three days ago, she told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime the most recent data was indicating a city-wide rate of 74 cases per 100,000.\nAsked what was driving the increase, she told BBC Scotland: \"It seems particularly to be household mixing. \n\"We know that restrictions are going to be lifted in a few days' time and I do understand people thinking if we can do it on Monday, why can't we do it now. But it is people mixing together in households that we think is the source of this increase.\"\nMs Caestecker said some upturn in case numbers was to be expected as restrictions eased, but she was \"concerned\" about the increase in Glasgow.\n\"It shows we cannot be complacent. The numbers go up very, very quickly - particularly as we see new variants coming in that are more transmissible,\" she said.\nA proportion of the cases in Glasgow are suspected to involve the Indian variant though this has still be confirmed through genomic sequencing.\n\"What we know is that it's not the Kent variant, so the assumption is it's the Indian variant but we haven't got the sequencing yet so we can't be sure,\" she said.\nNicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday that all mainland council areas would move to level two next week, with the exception of Moray where a final decision on whether it should remain in level three is to be made on Friday. \nLevel two rules mean people can meet up inside homes, pubs and restaurants can sell alcohol indoors and venues such as cinemas can reopen.\nThe previous major relaxation of Covid restrictions was on 26 April when non-essential shops and hospitality businesses reopened.\nThe impact of the easing of restrictions tends to show up in the figures about a fortnight later because of the incubation period of Covid-19 which is five to six days on average but can be as long as 14.\nClackmannanshire has also seen rising Covid rates recently, currently just below the 50 case threshold, with provisional data from PHS indicating the figure will rise further in the coming days. \nMidlothian, currently with 36 cases per 100,000, is another local authority area where case rates appear to be on the rise.

      "text": "Downing Street is seeking to cancel a county court judgement against Prime Minister Boris Johnson that cites an unpaid bill of \u00a3535.\nThe order was made against Mr Johnson, of 10 Downing Street, on 26 October, according to a judgement database.\nThe creditor and nature of the debt, which was first reported by Private Eye magazine, is not yet known.\nA Downing Street spokesperson said the claim against the PM was without merit.\n\"An application will be made for an order to set aside the default judgement, to strike out the claim and for a declaration that the claim is totally without merit,\" the spokesperson added. \nThe BBC understands the case relates to a defamation claim against Mr Johnson.\nCounty court judgements are issued in England and Wales when people fail to repay money they owe.\n\"If you get a judgement, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money,\" according to a government website.\nA bailiff \"may visit your home if you do not pay your debts\", the website warns.\nBanks and loan companies can also use the information to decide whether to issue credit or loans.\n\"If you're late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs,\" the website adds.\nAnyone who has had a county court judgement (CCJ) against them can apply for it to be cancelled - or \"set aside\" in the legal language - but they must convince the court that there is a good reason for this to happen and they have also acted promptly in launching their challenge.\nThat could include the judgement having been issued in error - perhaps because the debt had actually been paid, or because there was never a debt in the first place. \nSometimes, people seek to have a CCJ cancelled because they genuinely did not know about it - or they can show the court that it has acted incorrectly in making the order.\nThat can happen when the court has been provided with the wrong address for a debtor who only later learns of the judgement when they discover it has damaged their credit score. \nThe official rules for applications to set aside a judgement state: \"Most applications will require a hearing and you will be expected to attend. The court will allocate a hearing date and time for the application. Please indicate in a covering letter any dates that you are unavailable within the next six weeks.\"\nThe application must come with some kind of \"statement of truth\", explaining why the judgement should be set aside. \nThe prime minister could instruct a lawyer to appear for him.\nApplicants can also ask the court to consider waiving the \u00a3100 fee if it would cause them \"undue hardship\". \nThe prime minister's personal finances have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.\nIn particular, he has faced questions about how renovations to the flat, above 11 Downing Street, that he shares with fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds were paid for.\nHe has insisted he personally paid for the work, but has declined to say whether he received an initial loan.\nThe Electoral Commission is investigating whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and whether any donation to the Conservative Party was properly declared.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said the court judgement had nothing to do with the Downing Street estate refurbishment, saying: \"All bills have been paid by the government or the prime minister, personally.\" \nAsked if Number 10 had only become aware of the judgement when it was first reported earlier on Wednesday, the spokesman said it was something they are \"looking into currently\".\nAnd on being asked whether there should be concerns about the prime minister's personal finances, Mr Johnson's press secretary said: \"You should not be concerned, no.\""

      "title": "Covid: Lessons to be learned from spring 2022 public inquiry - PM",
      "tags": "Coronavirus public inquiry,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is \"fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage\" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nHe told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022.\nThe inquiry would place \"the state's actions under the microscope\", he added, and take evidence under oath.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021.\nBut addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not \"inadvertently distract\" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. \nThe inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in \"due course\", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. \nOn Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases.\nMr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the \"right moment\".\nHe said the \"new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here\".\n\"Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January.\"\nBolton has one of the highest instances of the Indian variant in the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s.\nHealth officials in Glasgow have expressed concern about a rising number of Covid cases in the city - the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. \nMore than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths.  \nThe inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. \nMr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a \"statutory basis\" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry.\nIn response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman \"will happen before the spring of next year\".\nMr Johnson - who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May - said: \"The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic.\"\nHe added: \"The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year.\"\nA WHO report released on Wednesday said the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. \nMost leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK.\nThe inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. \nKey questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only \"war-gamed\" a serious flu epidemic. \nWhy were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? \nWhy was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? \nThere will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. \nDifferent approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. \nThe biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. \nThe inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. \nThe Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were \"getting away from\u2026 early accountability\".  \nMeanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference.\nShe said spring 2022 was \"simply too late to begin\".\n\"It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year.\n\"A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter.\"\nAlong with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal \"lessons learned\" investigation into its handling of the pandemic.\nDowning Street confirmed an \"informal\" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published.\nFran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a \"rapid review\".\nShe told the BBC: \"That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would.\n\"That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions.\"\nDame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years.\"\nProfessor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry.\nHe told the BBC's Newscast podcast: \"What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise.\"\nIn the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic.\nHe added he \"wholeheartedly\" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as \"a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital\".\nIn response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was \"certainly\" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would \"say that with more clarity a bit later on\".\nEveryone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice.\nOn Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST.\nPregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers.\nMore than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab."

      "text": "US model Chrissy Teigen has apologised to TV personality Courtney Stodden for bullying them online a decade ago.\nIn 2011, Teigen allegedly sent Stodden messages on Twitter urging them to take their own life.\nIt was around the time that Stodden rose to fame as the 16-year-old bride of actor Doug Hutchison, who was 50 at the time of their wedding.\nStodden accepted the apology but said it may just be an attempt at limiting damage to Teigen's reputation.\nTeigen, who is married to singer John Legend, said she is now \"ashamed and completely embarrassed\" of her actions a decade ago.\nShe recently returned to Twitter after having taken a break due to being unable to handle the \"negativity\" on the platform.\n\"Not a lot of people are lucky enough to be held accountable for all their past... [comments] in front of the entire world,\" Teigen tweeted on Tuesday.\n\"I'm mortified and sad at who I used to be. I was an insecure, attention-seeking troll.\n\"I am ashamed and completely embarrassed at my behaviour but that is nothing compared to how I made Courtney feel.\"\nTeigen added she will \"forever work\" on being a better person and try not to let down her 13.6m followers again.\n\"I have worked so hard to give you guys joy and be beloved, and the feeling of letting you down is nearly unbearable, truly,\" she continued.\n\"These were not my only mistakes and surely won't be my last, as hard as I try but god I will try!!\"\nThe star claimed she had tried to contact Stodden privately, noting: \"I hope you [Stodden] can heal now knowing how deeply sorry I am.\"\nStodden, who recently came out as non-binary, accepted the apology but questioned its sincerity and accuracy.\n\"I accept her apology and forgive her,\" Stodden said. \"But the truth remains the same, I have never heard from her or her camp in private. In fact, she blocked me on Twitter.\n\"All of me wants to believe this is a sincere apology, but it feels like a public attempt to save her partnerships with Target and other brands who are realising her wokeness is a broken record.\"\nHutchison, who featured alongside Tom Hanks in the 1999 drama movie The Green Mile, was divorced from Stodden last year.\nStodden recently told The Daily Beast that other celebrities had commented on the relationship.\n\"People came out of the woodwork to beat up on a kid because she was in a situation that she shouldn't have been in,\" Stodden told the publication.\n\"There were a lot of celebrities acting like playground bullies.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A police chief has called for stiffer sentences for assaults on emergency service workers, saying penalties often \"don't go far enough\".\nNew figures show attacks including biting and spitting were, on average, 10% higher a month during the pandemic.\nGwent Police Chief Constable Pam Kelly's spoke out at the launch of a campaign by Wales' emergency services, condemning abuse suffered by staff. \nThe Home Office said it was doubling maximum sentences for such attacks.\n\"We need to look at these offences and society needs to say they're not acceptable,\" said Ms Kelly. \n\"That needs to be reflected in stiffer penalties and stiffer sentences.\"\nWith pubs in Wales set to reopen indoors on Monday, there is concern those figures could continue to rise.\nOverall crime recorded by police in England and Wales fell by 8% in 2020 as periods of lockdown caused theft reports to drop by more than a quarter, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nHowever figures from the emergency services show a peak in assaults occurred while lockdown restrictions were being eased last summer - with 256 cases recorded in July and 253 in August.\nMost assaults were on police officers, with a third resulting in injury.\nThe data also shows there were more than 600 instances of ambulance staff being attacked between April 2019 and November 2020.\nBut proportionately fewer assaults on ambulance staff resulted in some form of criminal proceedings.\nThe Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act was introduced in 2018, giving courts more severe sentencing powers when emergency service workers have been attacked. \nThe act doubled the maximum term from six months to 12 in England and Wales. \nIn 2020, a consultation was launched to consider doubling the maximum sentence again.\nChief Constable of South Wales Police Jeremy Vaughan has warned officers to prepare for a busy few months as nightlife resumed.\nHe called for people to take personal responsibility when lockdown eased and \"not to get in a position where they get so drunk that they are not capable of deciding what they do\".\nMs Kelly said: \"My concern is that sometimes the sentences are not what they ought to be and, therefore, our staff are not reporting assaults against themselves because they don't feel like people are listening to them.\n\"I think we really need to look at sentences and penalties for those people who commit those types of offences. \n\"It's not right that people who wear the uniform here in Wales are not having justice themselves. The penalties don't often go far enough. \n\"We need to make sure that when an emergency service worker is assaulted that justice is delivered for them.\"  \nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said it was concerned about the \"severe long-term impact\" of the abuse, with some victims unable to return to work for months.\n\"The impact for the individual is that they can be off work for a period of time, that then has a knock-on effect on the service,\" said Dylan Parry, project officer for violence and aggression at the service.\n\"It's been a very, very difficult year-and-a-half. Extremely tough circumstances for our staff to work in. \n\"It's tough enough on a daily basis without all the extras to go with it.\"\nThe emergency services have launched a year-long campaign encouraging the public to \"work with us, not against us\".\nIt will focus on key dates coinciding with a spike in assaults - for example large sporting events, bank holidays and Bonfire Night.\nPC Emily Hughes, from Gwent Police, was bitten on the hand while trying to restrain an offender while attending a domestic incident in 2020.  \n\"He was becoming extremely violent towards the officers and not listening to any of the verbal commands,\" she said.\n\"I cradled his head to prevent him from causing an injury to himself during which he had bitten me on the hand and broken the skin.\n\"Unfortunately, I've been a victim of assault quite a few times. It's something that's become more frequent. \n\"You'd probably struggle to find a serving officer who hasn't been assaulted at some point during their duties.\"\nPC Emma Birrell was on patrol in Northop Hall, Flintshire, when she was asked to keep a lookout for a silver Audi which was believed to be linked to a burglary.\nThe North Wales Police officer spotted the vehicle and, after signalling it to stop, two men got out and threw rocks towards her car, smashing the windscreen.\nThey drove off and she continued to follow the car, travelling through nearby Aston Hill and Ewloe at speeds in excess of 80mph before the vehicle stopped after a wheel came off.\nIt then reversed into police vehicle, injuring the officer, who was taken to hospital.\nAll four occupants were arrested and later jailed for various offences including burglary, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving while disqualified. One of the arresting officers was also injured while making an arrest.\nMr Vaughan, in charge of South Wales Police, said officers were putting themselves in harms way to protect and help the public, and some were being left with lasting trauma.\n\"People continue to come back to work the next day, or the next week, to protect the public and that amazes me the extent to which everybody across the emergency services is prepared to do that every day,\" he said.\nParamedic Darren Lloyd was assaulted by a patient in Bangor, Gwynedd, in April 2019. As a result, the man was jailed for 16 weeks.\nHe said that having just treated the patient, whom they suspected had suffered a drug overdose, he immediately \"turned quite nasty and violent towards us, saying that we had 'ruined his last hit'.\"\nHaving assaulted the crew in the ambulance, he followed them outside and continued to attack them in the street.  \nMr Lloyd said: \"At the time, your adrenaline is rushing and it takes time to settle down. \n\"But then you start to feel a little bit vulnerable, you start to question why, you start to wonder 'why me? Why did this happen? Did we do anything wrong?'\n\"That's the bit that worries a lot of us is, what did we do wrong for him to act in such a way? \"It's always in the back of your mind, 'will it happen again?'\"\nDylan Parry, Project Officer for Violence and Aggression for Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said some paramedics did not report abuse as it happened so regularly.\n\"These incidents have a devastating impact sometimes and an impact for the service as well,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We are there to help. We cannot be fighting for someone's life, if we are fighting for ours.\"\nThe UK government said: \"Emergency workers are our front-line heroes who put their lives on the line every single day to keep us safe, yet some despicable individuals still think it's acceptable to attack, cough or spit at these courageous public servants.\n\"Anyone who commits these despicable assaults should expect to face the full force of the law, which is why we are doubling the maximum sentence for those who assault emergency workers.\"\nAccording to research commissioned by Gwent Police on behalf of the Joint Emergency Services Group:"

      "tags": "Child abuse,Sentencing in England and Wales",
      "text": "The body overseeing criminal sentences in England and Wales is proposing treating paedophiles who are caught in stings the same as abusers who harm real children. \nThe plan from the Sentencing Council says judges should look at intent, rather than whether a child was harmed. \nUndercover operations with officers posing as children are a common way of uncovering paedophile rings. \nOffenders have sought reduced jail terms if no child came to harm. \nThe rules will cover the sentencing of all abusers caught via stings, usually operating online - including those run by police forces around the world and traps set by informal groups of people often dubbed \"paedophile hunters\". \nCurrent guidelines have long been interpreted as meaning that in many cases, where someone was caught in a sting, the jail term would be lower because of the absence of a child. \nBut last year, senior judges at the Court of Appeal looked at the actions of abusers - including one who thought he was on his way to meet a real child. \nThe judgement said that the intentions of the men should be the key starting point for their sentences.\nLord Justice Fulford, the lead judge on that case and a member of the Sentencing Council, said: \"The changes we are proposing today will make sure the courts give the proper weight to the harm intended by those who commit offences against children.  \n\"When an offender intends sexual activity with a child, that must be reflected in the sentence imposed, even where that activity does not ultimately take place.\"\nThe proposals would affect all abusers convicted of arranging a sexual offence with a child or inciting a child to take part in abuse, whether or not the harm was caused or the victim actually existed. \nThe maximum jail term for these crimes is 14 years and the guidelines set out how long offenders should be jailed for, depending on the specific circumstances of their crime.

      "tags": "Elon Musk,Bitcoin,Tesla,Climate change,Cryptocurrency",
      "text": "Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin due to climate change concerns, its CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet. \nBitcoin fell by more than 10% after the tweet, while Tesla shares also dipped. \nTesla's announcement in March that it would accept the cryptocurrency was met with an outcry from some environmentalists and investors.\nThe electric carmaker had in February revealed it had bought $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) of the world's biggest digital currency.\nBut on Thursday, it backtracked on its previous comments. \n\"We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\" Mr Musk wrote.\n\"Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\" \nHe also said the electric carmaker would not sell any of its Bitcoin, and intends to use it for transactions as soon as mining shifts to using more sustainable energy.\nMarket analysts see the move as an attempt by Tesla to assuage the concerns of investors who are focused on climate change and sustainability.\n\"Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues are now a major motivation for many investors. Tesla, being a clean energy-focused company, might want to work better in the environmental area of ESG,\" Julia Lee from Burman Invest told the BBC.\n\"But a cynic might suggest that this is just another move by Elon Musk to influence the cryptocurrency market, as he has done on so many other occasions,\" she added.\nElon Musk is hardly ill-informed when it comes to both technology and the environment. When I interviewed him in 2016 he spoke passionately about Tesla's mission to make transport sustainable in the battle against the \"existential threat\" of climate change.\nSo it is somewhat surprising that he has only just woken up to the fact that Bitcoin is not exactly a green project. Cambridge University's Centre for Alternative Finance runs a Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Right now, it shows that the process of mining the cryptocurrency - which involves using vast amounts of computer processing power - uses more electricity each year than Malaysia or Sweden and is closing in on the annual consumption of Egypt. \nBitcoin enthusiasts insist that mining mainly involves renewable energy - in truth, the miners focus on whatever is cheapest and in China, where many of them are based, that is often electricity generated by coal.\nWhen he announced his grand cryptocurrency plans back in February - and made Tesla's chief financial officer \"Master of Coin\" - Elon Musk sparked a surge in the value of Bitcoin and the adoration of its fanatical devotees. Now with the price falling the chatrooms are full of the angry and disappointed  - many of them sporting the glowing eyes Bitcoin avatar - accusing their former hero of betrayal.\nA move which was hailed as signalling that Bitcoin was going mainstream has ended up showing just how volatile - and downright flaky - the whole cryptocurrency scene can be.\nLast month, Tesla announced profits for the first three months of the year were $438m, up from $16m last year, boosted by sales of Bitcoin and environmental credits.\nMr Musk has been one of the world's most high profile proponents of cryptocurrencies, often tweeting about Bitcoin and the once-obscure digital currency Dogecoin.\nHis tweets in recent months helped to turn Dogecoin, which was started as a social media joke, into the world's fourth-biggest cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin is created by miners using high-powered computers to compete against each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles.\nIt is an energy-intensive process that often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal.\nThe dominance of Chinese Bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to switch from cheap fossil fuels to more expensive renewable energy sources could mean there are few quick solutions to the emissions concerns over Bitcoin.\nChina accounts for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world, according to recent research.\nThe cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's 10 largest cities, the study found.\nThat is because those Bitcoin miners tend to use electricity produced with fossil fuels, primarily coal, for most of the year, only shifting to renewable energy, mostly hydropower, during the rainy summer months.\nSupporters of Bitcoin point out that the mainstream financial system, with its millions of workers and computers in air-conditioned offices, also uses large amounts of electricity, which is usually produced with fossil fuels.\nReporting by the BBC's Peter Hoskins "

      "tags": "Vaccination,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has hailed a \"great day for America\" as US officials said vaccinated people can go mask-less in most indoor and outdoor settings.\nThe president removed his mask in the Oval Office with Republican lawmakers as the guidance was being announced.\nThe advice still calls for wearing masks in crowded indoor settings like buses, planes and hospitals.\nThe Biden administration has faced pressure to ease restrictions on fully vaccinated people.\nIn another major step for the US in returning to pre-pandemic life, the president of the 1.7m-member American Federation of Teachers labour union called for schools to reopen fully in the autumn. \nIt comes after Pfizer's vaccine was approved for children aged 12 to 15.\nThe US coronavirus caseload has fallen to its lowest point since last September, with deaths at their fewest since last April. \nAccording to the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical distancing can also cease for the fully vaccinated.\nMr Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and staff went without facial coverings during a White House Rose Garden event to trumpet the new guidelines.\n\"We're not going to go out and arrest people,\" added Mr Biden, urging non-vaccinated Americans to wear masks.\nHis Twitter account posted: \"The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. The choice is yours.\" The US president has no power to order Americans to get vaccinated or wear masks.\nThe latest rules come with about 35% of Americans now fully vaccinated, though the roll-out has been losing momentum.\nCDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said on Thursday at the White House: \"Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask. \n\"If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things you have stopped doing because of the pandemic. We have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy.\" \nThe guidance does not apply to healthcare facilities or places such as prisons and homeless shelters. Masks are also still advised for planes and other public transport.\nThe CDC's advice does not supersede local ordinances, and some businesses may still require customers and workers to wear masks.\nIn April, the CDC said masks can be avoided for most outdoor activities, but recommended their use in crowded settings. \nDr Walensky said that immuno-compromised people may want to consider continuing to wear a mask outdoors. \nThe CDC defines \"fully vaccinated\" as two weeks after receiving a second jab of a two-dose vaccine, or two weeks after the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe move could alarm some Americans, with less than half of the population fully vaccinated and no way to confirm whether someone has received their shots or not.\nPresident Biden has set a 4 July goal of vaccinating 70% of Americans with at least one jab. Around 250m jabs have been given so far, according to latest estimates."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has said he is \"anxious\" about the Indian variant of Covid and is \"ruling nothing out\" to tackle it.\nAsked specifically whether surge vaccinations could be introduced, a No 10 spokesman said ministers \"want to consider all options\".\nThis would mean focusing extra doses of vaccine in specific areas to immunise a larger section of the population, and reduce the spread of variants.\nPublic Health England has recorded 1,313 UK cases of the Indian variant.\nThe figures released on Thursday are more than double the 520 cases recorded by PHE up to 5 May.\nDr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at PHE, said: \"Cases of this variant are rising in the community and we are continuously monitoring its spread and severity to ensure we take rapid public health action.\n\"We need to act collectively and responsibly to ensure that variants do not impact on the progress we have all made to drive down levels of Covid-19 and the increased freedom that brings.\"\nGovernment scientific advisers met earlier to discuss the Indian variant.\nOn Thursday, the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,657 coronavirus cases.\nMore than 35.9 million people have received their first dose of a vaccine, and more than 18.8 million have had a second dose, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nSpeaking earlier at a primary school in Ferryhill, County Durham, the prime minister did not rule out reintroducing regional restrictions.\n\"It is a variant of concern, we are anxious about it,\" he said.\nAsked if local lockdowns were possible, Mr Johnson said: \"There are a range of things we could do, we want to make sure we grip it.\n\"Obviously there's surge testing, there's surge tracing.\n\"If we have to do other things, then of course the public would want us to rule nothing out.\"\nBut he added there was no evidence to suggest England's planned lockdown easing could not go ahead.\nAsked separately whether surge vaccinations could accompany surge testing in areas that have seen spikes of variants, a No 10 spokesman said: \"We want to make sure that we keep the public safe and keep our roadmap on track.\"\nHe added the government would consider any updates provided by Sage on the Indian variant and its spread in the UK. \nThe variant that was first detected in India, which may spread more quickly, is causing mounting concern.\nNumbers are relatively low, but they are rising and the planned unlocking from Monday in England would accelerate that spread.\nMeanwhile, the hugely successful vaccination campaign is not yet complete.\nSo the worry is there is still the possibility of a surge in cases and, because the vaccines are not perfect, a rise in the numbers of people in hospital. This would be much smaller than it would have been without vaccination.\nThe other issue is the number of confirmed cases tells us what happened between one and two weeks ago, rather than what is happening now. That's because there is a delay between someone catching the virus, it causing symptoms and then being confirmed as B.1.617.2.\nOne of the four tests for the roadmap out of lockdown has always been the role of new variants.\nThe key question is whether local approaches in variant hotspots - such as expanded testing and vaccination - would be enough, or if there needs to be a change to the overall plan.\nThe India variant - officially called B.1.617.2 -  is one of four mutated versions of coronavirus which have been designated as being \"of concern\" by UK public health bodies, with others first being identified in Kent, South Africa and Brazil.\nExperts believe the Indian variant has mutations that may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective.\nProf Robert Dingwall, a scientist on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said it seemed people who have been vaccinated \"have only a very low risk of infection\" from the Indian variant - and infection was \"likely to be mild\".\nHe said it \"seems to be slightly more transmissible\" than the UK and South African variants and could become the dominant variant in the UK. \n\"The consequence of this would be a greater number of mild illnesses with little risk of a surge in hospitalisations or deaths,\" he said.\n\"We need to stop panicking about every new variant that comes along,\" he added.\nThe recorded cases of the Indian variant in the UK have included cases in London, Bolton, Tyneside and Nottingham.\nPHE said mobile testing units have been set up in Bolton, and door-to-door PCR testing has been offered to 22,000 residents. \nThere have been at least 12 cases in Northern Ireland and between 20 and 30 in Scotland, where the variant is suspected to be spreading in Glasgow.\nExtra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week to offer the vaccine to those who are eligible under national guidelines.\nIt was earlier reported that additional doses had been given to these areas in order to open up jab appointments to all over-18s - but the council now says that is not the case.\nSources told the BBC surge testing in areas where the variant has been found \"isn't working\".\nThe current strategy was identifying cases but not stopping the spread, they told the BBC.\nThe sources added cases of the variant were being seen in many places with no links to travel and case numbers had been \"grossly underestimated\".\nThe BBC's senior political reporter Matt Cole said sources told him England was still expected to move to stage three of the roadmap out of lockdown on Monday, and the PM is thought to have signed off some reduction in social distancing measures - but a politically difficult rethink may now be under consideration.\nQuestions are also being raised about the potential need to delay stage four, due on 21 June, when the government hoped to remove all legal limits on social contact.\nSenior Tory Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of MPs, warned against any further lockdown measures, asking: \"Why on earth would we lock down when the vaccines continue to break the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths?\"\n\"We were told the roadmap was cautious - in spite of the overwhelmingly promising data on the benefits of the NHS vaccine rollout - precisely so it would be irreversible,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Ella Wills."

      "text": "Coronavirus vaccines have saved 11,700 lives and stopped 33,000 people becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 in England, research suggests.\nThe Public Health England analysis, up to the end of April, found people in their 70s and 80s had seen the biggest fall in deaths and hospital admissions.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the figures were \"remarkable\".\nGetting a vaccine is \"one of the most important things you will be asked to do in your lifetime\", he added.\nExtra vaccination clinics are being set up in parts of Lancashire to offer more jabs to people aged 38 and over, and anyone with an underlying health condition who is over 18. \nThis is, in part, to help reduce the spread of the India variant, which is causing concern because scientists believe it could be at least as transmissible as the Kent variant. \nNine out of 10 people aged 40 and over have now had a first vaccine dose in England. The impact of the vaccines is likely to be similar across the UK, with more than 53 million doses administered in total.\nPublic Health England (PHE) used data on how well the vaccines are working and the number of people being vaccinated in different age groups, to calculate deaths and illness prevented from Covid.\nIt is estimated that, thanks to vaccines:\nand:\nThe latest government data - based on evidence from the UK rollout - suggests one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine cuts the risk of infection by as much as 70%, and serious illness and death by even more.\nIf someone is less likely to become infected and have symptoms, then the spread of the virus between people is also less likely.\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: \"The vaccine has already saved so many lives and we can now see the huge impact it has had on preventing people becoming seriously ill and therefore also protecting our hospitals.\n\"As these figures highlight, getting your vaccine could save your life or stop you becoming seriously ill from Covid-19. \n\"It will also significantly reduce your chances of getting infected and infecting others. \n\"It is vital to get both doses of your vaccine when you are offered it.\""

      "text": "Two men who were being detained in an immigration van which was surrounded by protesters have been released. \nThe move followed a standoff between police officers and protesters in Kenmure Street on Glasgow's southside.\nEarly on Thursday people surrounded the Home Office vehicle believed to contain two Indian immigrants who had been removed from a flat.\nHundreds gathered in the area, with one man crawling under the van to prevent it from moving. \nThe Home Office said the men had been detained over \"suspected immigration offences\".\nSome of the protesters were heard shouting \"let our neighbours go\".\nIn a statement, Police Scotland said that Ch Supt Mark Sutherland had decided to have the men released. \nIt said: \"In order to protect the safety, public health and well-being of all people involved in the detention and subsequent protest in Kenmure Street, Pollokshields, today, Ch Supt Mark Sutherland has, following a suitable risk assessment, taken the operational decision to release the men detained by UK Immigration Enforcement back into their community meantime.\n\"In order to facilitate this quickly and effectively, Police Scotland is asking members of the public to disperse from the street as soon as possible. Please take care when leaving the area and follow the directions of the officers on the street.\"  \nEarlier the force stressed that it did not assist in the removal of asylum seekers, and that officers were at the scene to police the protest and to ensure public safety. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is also the MSP for the area, said she disagreed fundamentally with Home Office immigration policy. \nShe said: \"This action was unacceptable. To act in this way, in the heart of a Muslim community as they celebrated Eid, and in an area experiencing a Covid outbreak was a health and safety risk.\"\nShe said she would be \"demanding assurances\" from the UK government that they would not create such a dangerous situation again.\nShe added: \"No assurances were given - and frankly no empathy shown - when I managed to speak to a junior minister earlier.\"\nNicola Sturgeon and her justice secretary, Humza Yousaf are seeking follow up talks with the Home Secretary, Priti Patel.\nThey believe Immigration Enforcement has acted provocatively by trying to remove migrants from an ethnically diverse community during Eid. \nThe resulting protests brought people together, against Covid rules, in part of Glasgow which is experiencing a spike in cases linked to the Indian variant. \nPolice Scotland intervened on public health and public order grounds to require the release of the two Indian nationals being held by Immigration Enforcement. \nTheir operational decision is fully supported by Scottish ministers and while the Home Office is always grateful for police assistance, releasing the men on bail is hardly the outcome they wanted. \nThey will not have enjoyed being seen to back down in the face of public and political protest. \nHumza Yousaf, the Scottish government's justice secretary, said: \"the action they [the Home Office] have today is at best completely reckless, and at worst intended to provoke, on a day the UK government would have known the Scottish government and MSPs would be distracted by parliamentary process.\"\nHe added that the situation \"should never have occurred\", and that \"the UK government's hostile environment is not welcome here.\"\nIn a statement, the Home Office said: \"The UK government is tackling illegal immigration and the harm it causes, often to the most vulnerable people by removing those with no right to be in the UK.\n\"The operation in Glasgow was conducted in relation to suspected immigration offences and the two Indian nationals complied with officers at all times.\n\"The UK government continues to tackle illegal migration in all its forms and our New Plan for Immigration will speed up the removal of those who have entered the UK illegally.\"\nThe Sikhs in Scotland group said in a statement that it was \"deeply concerned\", and urged the Home Office to \"abandon forced removals and to adopt an immigration policy based on human rights, compassion and dignity\". \nMohammad Asif, of the Afghan Human Rights Foundation, said hundreds of people were protesting.\nThe 54-year-old added: \"We're here against the hostile environment created by the Tories and the British state.\"\nIncidents like Kenmure Street - at the centre of Scotland's most ethnically diverse neighbourhood - will do nothing to persuade those who already believe the UK's policy on immigration is unfair and inhumane.\nDespite the protest, the Home Office says it was a legitimate operation targeting those it suspected of immigration offences.\nAnd yet there could be more problems on the horizon. The Home Office has just ended its consultation on its New Plan for Immigration - a policy that will speed up deportations for those who have entered the country 'illegally'.\nThose in such a position will not be able to claim asylum and will instead be granted 'temporary protection', a status that would come under periodic review. \nMore than 70 charities and faith groups in Scotland have condemned such proposals.\nThe Home Office is toughening its stance on immigration, but says its policies will make the system fairer for those most in need, while discouraging criminal activity like people trafficking. \nThe Scottish government, and the protestors in Glasgow today, fundamentally disagree."

      "text": "A council in Lancashire has clarified its statement that Covid vaccines would be offered to all over-18s due to concerns about the Indian variant.\nBlackburn with Darwen Council said jabs would be offered only to over-18s with health conditions, in line with government guidance.\nA spokeswoman had earlier said all over-18s could book vaccines.\nThe council has now said additional clinics will be opening to help offer more jabs to those eligible.\nIt said the push would begin next week and go hand-in-hand with a programme of surge testing in the area.\nA spokesman said: \"Contrary to earlier social media and news reporting, vaccines at the clinics will not be widely available to over-18s.\n\"They will be available within current government guidance, which is currently anyone over the age of 38, anyone over 18 with an underlying health condition or who lives with someone who has lowered immunity, health and social care staff and carers.\"\nThe council had earlier provided a statement saying: \"The council and NHS partners have secured extra doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be made available to anyone in Blackburn with Darwen aged over 18 from next week.\"\nIn a joint statement, council leader Mohammed Khan, chief executive Denise Park, and director of public health Professor Dominic Harrison said: \"While the Prime Minister announced this week that we can progress to step three of the government's road map as planned next week, we need everyone in Blackburn with Darwen to be extra vigilant and proceed with caution.\n\"The variant first identified in India is more transmissible than other variants, which means it is easily passed on from one person to another.\"\nThe development comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not rule out a return to local lockdowns in future.\nSpeaking during a visit to a primary school earlier, Mr Johnson said: \"There are a range of things that we could do. We want to make sure we grip it.\n\"Obviously there's surge testing, surge tracing, making sure that whenever you have a case, you check everybody who's been in contact with that person. \n\"But if we do have to do other things, then of course, I think the public would want us at this stage to rule nothing out.\"\nBy Rob England, BBC England Data Unit\nThe recent rise in cases in Blackburn has been confirmed to be linked \"in part\" to the new Indian variant.\nIt joins Bolton and Sefton in the North West as well as parts of London in seeing a spread of the newest variant of concern.\nIn the latest weekly figures, the town recorded the third highest infection rate in England, with an 89% jump in cases compared to the previous week.\nAs with other areas, mass testing is due to be deployed in hotspots, and there are early indications health teams will be stepping up the vaccination rollout.\nHowever, it's worth noting that although the new variant is thought to spread as easily as previous ones, there's no evidence to suggest it causes more serious illness.\nHospital admissions do not seem to have increased in line with cases, and the area hasn't seen a death with coronavirus for the past six weeks.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nWhen Elaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January she was immediately classed as an urgent case. She should have been operated on within weeks but the procedure was cancelled due to the backlog caused by the pandemic. Her story isn't unusual. BBC News has carried out an in-depth analysis on the impact of Covid on the NHS and found there is a huge backlog with waiting lists ballooning at some hospitals. But plans are under way to tackle the backlog and Elaine is due to have surgery tomorrow.\nAdults are more likely to report mild and moderate side-effects after mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines, a study indicates. Chills, headaches and muscle pain were reported more frequently when different vaccine doses were combined. Any adverse reactions were short lived, with no other safety concerns. \"It's a really intriguing finding and not something we were necessarily expecting,\" Prof Matthew Snape, from the Oxford Vaccine Group said.\nLockdown has hit live indoor events as hard as any industry and, for comedy promoters, the experience has not been at all amusing. The Glee Club has had little to smile about since being forced to close its doors in March 2020. With one comedy and music venue in Glasgow and four others in England and Wales, revenues have been shattered in the past year. The company had forecast income of close to \u00a35m across all of its clubs for 2020.\nAt a Covid vaccine appointment, you will probably be warned of possible side effects - fever, headache, a sore arm for a day or two afterwards. Changes to the menstrual cycle will not appear on the list. But women online around the world have started asking if early, heavy or painful periods might be an unlisted reaction to the jab. Our Reality Check team has looked into it.\nMore than a billion Covid-19 vaccines have gone into arms around the world. We take a look at how five countries - the UK, US, Canada, India, and Chile - are faring in their vaccination efforts, and what it means for ending lockdowns. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAn independent inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic was announced on Wednesday but what is it and how will it work?\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An outbreak of Covid cases in the south of Glasgow is \"relatively contained\", according to national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch.\nHe said he hoped the city would move down to level two restrictions as planned on Monday.\nHowever, he said no decisions had yet been taken and that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would provide updates about both Glasgow and Moray on Friday.\nShe said on Tuesday that Moray was likely to stay in level three.\nThis followed a surge in cases in the area, which currently has a case rate of 98.1 per 100,000 - well above a key threshold for easing restrictions.\nThe latest published rate for Glasgow is 70.9 per 100,000.\nMr Leitch said people should be concerned about the increasing numbers in the city.\nBut he added: \"It is relatively contained, not yet exponential growth like we have seen with this virus before.\"\nProf Leitch said there had been a \"precision public health response\u2026 throwing everything at it, testing, extra vaccination clinics, really asking the public to step up and help us as much they can.\"\nAsked if the whole of Glasgow may have to stay in level three, he said: \"I really hope not.\"\nHe said meetings had taken place on Thursday with local public health teams in both Glasgow and Moray, and that no decisions had been taken in either area.\nThe rest of mainland Scotland is scheduled to move to level two Covid restrictions on Monday, which will allow people to hug and visit other households indoors. Most islands will move to level one.\nClackmannanshire has also seen rising Covid rates recently, and is now just above the 50-case threshold at 52.4. \nCases also seem to be on the rise in Midlothian, which has 48.7 cases per 100,000.\nThe reasons behind the increase in cases in Glasgow are not yet known, although it is suspected the so-called Indian variant has played a role.\nNHS Greater Glasgow Clyde and Glasgow City Council is writing to all households in the G41 and G42 areas, asking people to get tested regardless of whether they have symptoms.\nPublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld said door-to-door testing was needed, as has happened in areas of England - but people in those parts of Glasgow will be asked to go to test sites themselves.\nThe difference between Glasgow and Moray is that the clusters in Scotland's biggest city have been sourced to specific postcode areas and linked to household mixing. \nIn Moray it quickly became widespread community transmission hence the decision to remain in level three there. \nThe real test for public health teams in Glasgow will be the new Indian variant, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak in the southside. It's known to be at least as transmissible as the UK variant, and it has also led to outbreaks in some parts of England. \nI don't get the sense that officials in Glasgow are panicking but they are concerned. Expect to see enhanced efforts to get people tested even if they don't have symptoms and encouragement from community leaders to stick to the rules.\nThe context in which this is happening is also very different now. The success of the vaccine means that, so far,  this outbreak has not led to a jump in hospital admissions. But it is early days and younger people in particular, who are more likely to become infected, still need get their jag.\nDr Linda de Caestecker, director of public health at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said the south of the city appeared to be affected and there had been a \"cluster of outbreaks\" linked to household transmission.\nShe said: \"The rise in cases in certain areas of Glasgow is a cause for concern, particularly at a time of such progress in the fight against the virus across NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\n\"A rise in household mixing seems to be the principal reason for the increase.\"\nShe urged everyone to follow the current rules, not the ones which are likely to apply from Monday.\n\"In addition, we are seeing new variants that are more transmissible and that is another reason why we cannot be complacent at this critical time,\" she added.\nOn Wednesday, Prof Leitch said that between 20 and 30 cases of the so-called Indian variant had been identified in Scotland.\nHowever Prof Bauld told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday that sources, including Cog UK - the UK's genomic sequencing consortium - suggest instances of this variant may be even higher.\nShe said it was \"extremely important\" to identify the prevalence of the Indian variant.\nProf Bauld said: \"In other parts of the UK where we've seen these cases, surge testing is needed - that means not just asking people to turn up, it's going door-to-door. \n\"Our attention needs to be focused on that and when cases are identified how do we give maximum support to communities to successfully self isolate and stop those chains of transmission?\"\nProf Bauld added that the increase in cases appeared \"mostly in younger people\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said the situation in Glasgow is being monitored \"very closely\".\nShe tweeted: \"We are seeing an increase in cases in Glasgow just now and, amidst concern about the so-called Indian variant, we are monitoring it very closely.\"\nMs Sturgeon and other leading politicians have also issued words of caution this week around celebrations of Eid - one of the biggest holidays in the Muslim calendar.\nWhile Prof Bauld said \"questions will be asked\" about the profile of cases in Glasgow, it was \"perhaps premature\" to enforce rules which would restrict the whole council area.\nShe said: \"I think a localised approached - a really concentrated identification and support of cases - is the first step. What we don't want is spread beyond those areas, it is about stopping the chain of transmission.\n\"In the past we, perhaps, had not acted early enough to get on top of outbreaks -  this is just a red flag that needs to be dealt with.\""

      "tags": "Earth science,Geology,Winchcombe,Natural History Museum,Meteorites",
      "text": "From Monday, you'll get a chance to see the most famous space rock in Britain.\nThe meteorite that fell on the Gloucestershire town of Winchcombe in February is going on public display at London's Natural History Museum.\nScientists are busy studying the rock because it holds within it chemistry that existed at the formation of our Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\nBut they've got enough material to enable a 100g chunk to also be shown off to museum visitors.\nTo the uninitiated, the display meteorite looks like a small piece of half-burnt coal. Lean in close, though, and you can see some strands of grass and even some mud. This is something that fell out of the sky into a field.\nVictoria Bond, whose land that was and who's donated the rock fragment to the museum, is still surprised by the discovery.\nShe'd given permission for scientists to come on to her farm to perform a systematic sweep, but doubted anything would be found among all the sheep faeces that covered the ground.\n\"They were moving like zombies, pacing back and forth in a line, looking for the meteorite,\" she recalls. \"And as I left that morning in my car, I could see them jumping for joy. \n\"How they found it is amazing. I'm thinking of putting a plaque in the field because the footpath, the Cotswold Way, is no more than 100 yards away.\"\nFrom the many videos of the incoming fireball that were recorded that Sunday night, and also from the thousands of eyewitness accounts, researchers had been able to correctly identify where in England rocky debris might come down. And the subsequent searches turned up trumps. It was Mira Ihasz in a University of Glasgow-led sweep of the Bond land that spotted something precious among the sheep poo.\nThat discovery may have been the single biggest chunk recovered in the Winchcombe area, but the museum has many more pieces now in its collection - roughly 500g.\nThey are kept in a special box to keep them dry. Each piece is in a little bag. Lumps larger than a pea are wrapped in foil first.\nMuch of the material comes from the driveway of the Wilcock family. Their home was in the crosshairs of the fireball.\nRob, his wife Cathryn and daughter Hannah had carefully picked up some of the debris that went splat on the tarmac. Museum scientists then came in to sweep up the remaining dust using a toothbrush and an empty cottage cheese pot. \nBelieve it or not, those plastic ephemera are now part of the national collection, too. As will be a square of the dented Wilcock driveway when it's dug up. These artefacts are all part of the story and will eventually join the Bond fragment on display.\n\"It's fabulous to see the Winchcombe meteorite finally on show. It's so beautiful,\" says Cathryn. \"It's mind-blowing,\" adds Hannah. \nThere's some crazy money being offered online right now by privateer collectors seeking to buy or sell Winchcombe space rock.\nBut Rob says the family never thought of selling their share: \"We wanted the meteorite (to go to the museum) to inspire young people to get into science and do lots of good work. We owe a lot to scientists at the moment and I think we should inspire the next generation.\"\nDr Helena Bates, the interim curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, certainly hopes that will be the case.\n\"This is the first meteorite to be observed to fall and then be recovered in the UK for 30 years,\" she tells BBC News.\n\"But the other thing is, we have not had a carbonaceous chondrite ever fall in the UK. Carbonaceous chondrites are really, really special, because they are basically some of the oldest, most pristine material we could possibly get to look at. \n\"They're like time capsules from the beginning of the Solar System. That piece of rock that fell in Gloucestershire has a 4.567-billion-year history.\"\nScientists in the UK and abroad are subjecting the meteorite pieces to a battery of tests.\nYou might think that 500g - the weight of half a bag of sugar - represents an inadequate supply for all the researchers who want to examine it. But it's actually ample. Space missions sent to retrieve similar rock from asteroids would be thrilled to grab as much.  \nThe museum's Dr Ashley King is bombarding a tiny bit with X-rays to reveal its mineral make-up. \n\"Each kind of mineral has its own characteristic X-ray pattern. It's like a fingerprint,\" he says.\n\"When the Solar System was forming, there was this huge cloud of gas and dust with the Sun at the centre, and then everything started accreting together to make bigger bodies, like the asteroids and the comets and eventually the planets. This meteorite tells us what minerals were present back then.\"\nThe scientists know enough already about Winchcombe to make a submission to the international body that classifies meteorites. \nIt's very probably what's referred to as a CM carbonaceous chondrite. CMs are highly prized because they contain abundant organic, or carbon-rich, molecules. This, obviously, is chemistry that fascinates researchers because it lies at the basis of life.\nWe don't have traces of biological activity on Earth until almost a billion years after the Solar System's formation, but studying meteorites like Winchcombe could give us clues as to how life got going on our planet.\nThat's an amazing thought as you gaze at the 100g block in the museum's glazed display-case.\nThe Natural History Museum reopens to the public on Monday after its enforced Covid closure. To get in, visitors must book a free timed ticket in advance online at the museum's website."

      "text": "China has imprisoned or detained at least 630 imams and other Muslim religious figures since 2014 in its crackdown in the Xinjiang region, according to new research by a Uyghur rights group. \nThe research, compiled by the Uyghur Human Rights Project and shared with the BBC, also found evidence that 18 clerics had died in detention or shortly after.\nMany of the detained clerics faced broad charges like \"propagating extremism\", \"gathering a crowd to disturb social order\", and \"inciting separatism\". \nAccording to testimony from relatives, the real crimes behind these charges are often things like preaching, convening prayer groups, or simply acting as an imam.\nThe UHRP, working with rights group Justice for All, tracked the fates of 1,046 Muslim clerics \u2014 the vast majority of them Uyghurs \u2014 using court documents, family testimony and media reports from public and private databases. \nWhile all 1,046 clerics were reportedly detained at some point, in many cases corroborating evidence was not available because of China's tight control over information in the region. \nAmong the 630 cases where it was, at least 304 of the clerics appeared to have been sent to prison, as opposed to the network of \"re-education\" camps most closely associated with China's mass detention of the Uyghurs.\nWhere information was available from court documents or testimony about the length of the prison sentence, the punishments reflect the harsh nature of Xinjiang justice: 96% sentenced to at least five years and 26% to 20 years or more, including 14 life sentences.\nThe database, which drew on research by the Uyghur activist Abduweli Ayup, as well as the Xinjiang Victims Database and Uyghur Transitional Justice Database, is by no means exhaustive \u2014 representing only a fraction of the total estimated number of imams in Xinjiang \u2014 and much of the data cannot be independently verified.\nBut the research shines a light on the specific targeting of religious figures in Xinjiang, appearing to support allegations that China is attempting to break the religious traditions of the Uyghurs and assimilate them into Han Chinese culture. \nChina denies those allegations, saying the purpose of its so-called \"re-education\" programme in Xinjiang is to stamp out extremism among the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.\nChina is believed to have detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, a large region in north-western China that is home to various ethnically Turkic peoples. The state has been accused of human rights abuses in the region, including forced labour, sterilisation and rape.\nMost of those detained in Xinjiang are sent to \"re-education\" facilities \u2014 prison-like camps where they are held for indeterminate periods of time without charge. But others have been given formal prison sentences, the number and severity of which have increased dramatically since 2017.\nPublicly available detention or charging documents are rare, but those that do exist demonstrate how the state has worked to tie ordinary religious expression in Xinjiang to extremism or political separatism.\nAccording to the arrest notice for Oken Mahmet, a 51-year-old Kazakh imam from Qaba in Xinjiang, Mahmet was charged with \"propagating extremism\". According to testimony collated by the Xinjiang Victims Database, his family says he was arrested for leading Friday prayers and officiating marriages at a mosque. \nMahmet's initial detention notice says he was detained for \"inciting people to violate national laws pertaining to the reading of marriage vows, education, and public governance, as well as making and propagating items related to extremism\". His sentence was reportedly eight to 10 years.\nBaqythan Myrzan, a 58-year-old state-approved imam from Hami prefecture, was also arrested for \"propagating extremism\". Myrzan was detained in August 2018 and held at a detention facility until May 2019, when he was sentenced to 14 years at the Bingtuan Urumqi Prison. Myrzan's family says his only crime was going about his duties as an imam.\nAnd the only clues to the alleged offence committed by Abidin Ayup, a prominent scholar and imam from Atush city, were a few lines that appeared in a long court document from a separate case against a Han Chinese official. The official was accused of allowing Ayup's son to visit him at a hospital detention facility after he was arrested. The court document refers to Ayup, who was 88 when he was detained in 2017, as a \"religious extremist\".\nAyup's niece Maryam Muhammad told the BBC the imam was a \"kind, hardworking, charitable man, cultured and knowledgeable, who encouraged young people to study not only religion but all the school subjects\". \nMuhammad, who is now in the US, said nearly 60 members of her extended family had been detained since Ayup's arrest, including her husband and all of the imam's eight children.\nExtremism charges were being issued on a \"flimsy legal basis\" in Xinjiang for \"offences that shouldn't even qualify as offences\", said Donald Clarke, a professor at George Washington University who specialises in Chinese law.\n\"Setting to one side for a moment whether you accept 'propagating extremism' as a valid charge, the question is do the facts make a plausible case for that charge?\" he said. \"And the alleged offences we have seen \u2014 things like having a beard, not drinking, or travelling abroad \u2014 suggest they don't.\"\nThe real reason imams were being targeted was \"because of their ability to bring people together in the community\", said Peter Irwin, senior programme officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. \n\"The state has been carefully dealing with imams for a long time because it knows the influence they have,\" he said. \"The detentions and imprisonments of the past few years are just the culmination of three decades of repression designed to constrict Uyghur culture and religion.\"\nA spokesman for the Chinese government told the BBC that Xinjiang \"enjoys unprecedented freedom of religious belief\". \n\"Xinjiang's 'de-radicalisation' effort has effectively contained the spread of religious extremism and made a great contribution to global 'de-radicalisation' efforts,\" he said.\nTargeting of the Turkic ethnic groups in north-western China is not a new phenomenon. Muslim minorities suffered long periods of repression between the 1950s and 1970s, when Qurans were burned, mosques and cemeteries desecrated, and traditional dress and hair styles prohibited.\nThe 1980s brought a period of relative openness and revival. Damaged mosques were repaired and new mosques built; religious festivals allowed and imams and other figures permitted to travel; and the Quran translated for the first time into Uyghur, by the prominent Uyghur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim.\nBut a violent uprising by Uyghur militants in 1990, in the town of Baren in Xinjiang, precipitated a crackdown by the Chinese state and the beginning of a two-decade period of gradually tightening control. Imams, seen by authorities as influential community figures, were increasingly required to demonstrate loyalty to the state.\nIn the early 2000s, many imams were compelled to attend formalised education courses that foreshadowed the mass \"re-education\" programmes pursued today against the general population. According to Human Rights Watch, roughly 16,000 imams and other religious figures underwent \"political re-education\" between 2001 and 2002.\nAmong them was Tursun, an imam who was first detained in 2001 for translating prayers from Arabic into Uyghur for his congregation, according to his niece.\nTursun's two-year stint in a \"re-education through labour\" camp marked the beginning of a two-decade ordeal at the hands of the state, his niece told the BBC from outside China. Her uncle was freed from the labour camp in 2002 but constantly harassed by police, she said, and frequently taken away again for two-week periods of \"study\". Then in 2005, he was detained again but this time sentenced to four years in prison.\n\"We were not given any notice from the court,\" his niece said. \"My family went to the police station to enquire about his fate and the police gave them a handwritten note containing information about his prison sentence and the address of the prison.\"\nTursun was released from prison in 2009, only to be detained again in 2017 after the hardline politician Chen Quanguo was put in charge of Xinjiang and escalated the campaign against the Uyghurs. \nAs appears to be the case with other imams in the region, Tursun's family was subsequently targeted en masse, said his niece, who had left China by that time.\n\"After I heard the news of my uncle and his wife's arrests, I heard that my mother and many of my relatives were also arrested. Anyone over 14 was taken away,\" she said. \"For the last four years I have been trying to find information regarding their whereabouts, especially my mother.\"\nAbout a month ago, Tursun's niece learned that her mother had been sentenced to 13 years in prison and her younger brother to five years. She doesn't know what the charges were. Her father is already serving a life sentence, she said, issued in 2008 for \"illegal preaching\" and \"separatism\".\n\"My mother was a simple housewife and she was sentenced to 13 years,\" she said. \"I cannot imagine how long my uncle has been sent to prison for.\"\nThey were targeted \"because of their invisible authority\", she added. \"The state has tried everything to break them, to destroy them. And not only the religious leaders but also those who practise Islam quietly, and take pride in being Uyghur. They have made every effort to dig them out and destroy them.\"\nSome that disappear into detention never come out. Eighteen imams named in the database were reported to have died while in custody or shortly after. \nNurgazy Malik, a father of two, graduate of the official Xinjiang Islamic Institute and editor-in-chief of a state-approved religious magazine, reportedly died in detention in November 2018. Unconfirmed reports say Chinese authorities acknowledged his death to his family, but did not produce a body \u2014 a situation echoed in other, similar reports. Malik's friends and relatives held a funeral for him in Kazakhstan all the same.\nIn late 2019, as its network of \"re-education\" camps drew intense international scrutiny, China claimed it had released everyone from the system. Significant numbers had been released, into house arrest or into the otherwise controlled environment of Xinjiang, but rights groups say many were simply transferred to formal prisons. \nThere is also evidence that many thousands had been in prison all along. Incarceration rates exploded in Xinjiang in 2017 and 2018, according to reporting by the New York Times and others, sweeping up at least 230,000 people \u2014 about 200,000 more than in previous years. \nAccording to Chinese government data, criminal arrests in Xinjiang accounted for 21% of the country's total in 2017, despite the region having about 1.5% of the population. \nUnlike the \"re-education\" system, formal prison sentences should create a paper trail. But the court documents are \"nowhere to be found\", according to Gene Bunin, the researcher behind the Xinjiang Victims Database. \nAccording to Bunin, only 7,714 criminal verdicts are available for Xinjiang for 2018, despite the region logging 74,348 criminal cases that year. The near total absence of verdicts on charges typically levied against religious Uyghurs, like \"propagating extremism\" and \"inciting separatism\", suggests China is intentionally scrubbing the record.\nWhere official documents are available and contain details, offences can be shocking in their innocuity.   \nIn one 2018 verdict, now deleted from the government records but archived by the Xinjiang Victims Database, a 55-year-old Uyghur farmer already serving 10 years for \"propagating extremism\" had his sentence doubled after he \"used a disguised and simplified method to perform the namaz prayer in the prison dormitory\". \nEssentially, Ismayil Sidiq secretly prayed in prison. He was reported by a cellmate and charged with \"illegal religious activities\" and \"inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination\" \u2014 the latter charge for allegedly shouting that Uyghurs should not inform on one another. He will be eligible for release in 2038.\nThose who are detained in camps stand a better chance of release after a few months or years, but release in Xinjiang does not necessarily mean freedom.\nMemet, a Uyghur who fled Xinjiang, told the BBC his father was detained in 2017 after many years serving peacefully as an imam. Memet had been able to learn news of his family over the years from an acquaintance in Xinjiang \u2014 someone distant enough from the family that she felt safe messaging abroad from her WeChat account \u2014 but Memet heard virtually no news of his father's condition for four years.\nThen recently he heard his father had been released, and Memet imagined speaking to him for the first time in years. He asked the family acquaintance if she would be willing to find his father and connect them again via her phone. \nOn the appointed day, Memet received a message on his WeChat account from the acquaintance. She said she had found his father, but he had told her it would be better if he didn't speak to his son. And after she sent the message, she blocked Memet from contacting her again.\nSome names have been changed."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has said he is \"anxious\" about the Indian variant of Covid and is \"ruling nothing out\" to tackle it.\nAsked specifically whether surge vaccinations could be introduced, a No 10 spokesman said ministers \"want to consider all options\".\nThis would mean focusing extra doses of vaccine in specific areas to immunise a larger section of the population, and reduce the spread of variants.\nPublic Health England has recorded 1,313 UK cases of the Indian variant.\nThe figures released on Thursday are more than double the 520 cases recorded by PHE up to 5 May.\nDr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at PHE, said: \"Cases of this variant are rising in the community and we are continuously monitoring its spread and severity to ensure we take rapid public health action.\n\"We need to act collectively and responsibly to ensure that variants do not impact on the progress we have all made to drive down levels of Covid-19 and the increased freedom that brings.\"\nGovernment scientific advisers met earlier to discuss the Indian variant.\nOn Thursday, the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,657 coronavirus cases.\nMore than 35.9 million people have received their first dose of a vaccine, and more than 18.8 million have had a second dose, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nSpeaking earlier at a primary school in Ferryhill, County Durham, the prime minister did not rule out reintroducing regional restrictions.\n\"It is a variant of concern, we are anxious about it,\" he said.\nAsked if local lockdowns were possible, Mr Johnson said: \"There are a range of things we could do, we want to make sure we grip it.\n\"Obviously there's surge testing, there's surge tracing.\n\"If we have to do other things, then of course the public would want us to rule nothing out.\"\nBut he added there was no evidence to suggest England's planned lockdown easing could not go ahead.\nAsked separately whether surge vaccinations could accompany surge testing in areas that have seen spikes of variants, a No 10 spokesman said: \"We want to make sure that we keep the public safe and keep our roadmap on track.\"\nHe added the government would consider any updates provided by Sage on the Indian variant and its spread in the UK. \nThe variant that was first detected in India, which may spread more quickly, is causing mounting concern.\nNumbers are relatively low, but they are rising and the planned unlocking from Monday in England would accelerate that spread.\nMeanwhile, the hugely successful vaccination campaign is not yet complete.\nSo the worry is there is still the possibility of a surge in cases and, because the vaccines are not perfect, a rise in the numbers of people in hospital. This would be much smaller than it would have been without vaccination.\nThe other issue is the number of confirmed cases tells us what happened between one and two weeks ago, rather than what is happening now. That's because there is a delay between someone catching the virus, it causing symptoms and then being confirmed as B.1.617.2.\nOne of the four tests for the roadmap out of lockdown has always been the role of new variants.\nThe key question is whether local approaches in variant hotspots - such as expanded testing and vaccination - would be enough, or if there needs to be a change to the overall plan.\nThe India variant - officially called B.1.617.2 -  is one of four mutated versions of coronavirus which have been designated as being \"of concern\" by UK public health bodies, with others first being identified in Kent, South Africa and Brazil.\nExperts believe the Indian variant has mutations that may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective.\nProf Robert Dingwall, a scientist on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said it seemed people who have been vaccinated \"have only a very low risk of infection\" from the Indian variant - and infection was \"likely to be mild\".\nHe said it \"seems to be slightly more transmissible\" than the UK and South African variants and could become the dominant variant in the UK. \n\"The consequence of this would be a greater number of mild illnesses with little risk of a surge in hospitalisations or deaths,\" he said.\n\"We need to stop panicking about every new variant that comes along,\" he added.\nThe recorded cases of the Indian variant in the UK have included cases in London, Bolton, Tyneside and Nottingham.\nPHE said mobile testing units have been set up in Bolton, and door-to-door PCR testing has been offered to 22,000 residents. \nThere have been at least 12 cases in Northern Ireland and between 20 and 30 in Scotland, where the variant is suspected to be spreading in Glasgow.\nExtra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week to offer the vaccine to those who are eligible under national guidelines.\nIt was earlier reported that additional doses had been given to these areas in order to open up jab appointments to all over-18s - but the council now says that is not the case.\nSources told the BBC surge testing in areas where the variant has been found \"isn't working\".\nThe current strategy was identifying cases but not stopping the spread, they told the BBC.\nThe sources added cases of the variant were being seen in many places with no links to travel and case numbers had been \"grossly underestimated\".\nThe BBC's senior political reporter Matt Cole said sources told him England was still expected to move to stage three of the roadmap out of lockdown on Monday, and the PM is thought to have signed off some reduction in social distancing measures - but a politically difficult rethink may now be under consideration.\nQuestions are also being raised about the potential need to delay stage four, due on 21 June, when the government hoped to remove all legal limits on social contact.\nSenior Tory Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of MPs, warned against any further lockdown measures, asking: \"Why on earth would we lock down when the vaccines continue to break the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths?\"\n\"We were told the roadmap was cautious - in spite of the overwhelmingly promising data on the benefits of the NHS vaccine rollout - precisely so it would be irreversible,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Ella Wills."

      "title": "Hamas: The Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza",
      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Hamas",
      "text": "Hamas is the largest of several Palestinian militant Islamist groups.\nIts name is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, originating as it did in 1988 after the beginning of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under its charter, it is committed to the destruction of Israel.\nHamas originally had a dual purpose of carrying out an armed struggle against Israel - led by its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - and delivering social welfare programmes.\nBut since 2005, when Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, Hamas has also engaged in the Palestinian political process. It won the legislative elections in 2006, before reinforcing its power in Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas. \nSince then, militants in Gaza have fought four major conflicts with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and to pressure it to stop attacks.\nHamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, as well as other powers.\nHamas came to prominence after the first intifada as the main Palestinian group opposed to the Oslo peace accords signed in the early 1990s between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the body representing most Palestinians. \nDespite numerous Israeli operations against it and clampdowns by the Palestinian Authority (the main governing body of the Palestinians) Hamas found it had an effective power of veto over the process by launching suicide attacks.\nIt carried out multiple bus bombings, killing scores of Israelis, and stepped up its attacks after Israel assassinated its chief bomb maker Yahya Ayyash in December 1995. \nThe bombings were widely blamed for turning Israelis off the peace process and bringing Benjamin Netanyahu - a staunch opponent of the Oslo accords - to power in 1996.\nIn the post-Oslo world, most particularly following the failure of US President Bill Clinton's Camp David summit in 2000 and the second intifada which followed shortly thereafter, Hamas gained power and influence as Israel clamped down on the Palestinian Authority, which it accused of sponsoring deadly attacks.\nHamas organised clinics and schools, which served Palestinians who felt let down by the corrupt and inefficient Palestinian Authority, dominated by the Fatah faction.\nMany Palestinians cheered the wave of Hamas suicide attacks in the first years of the second intifada. They saw \"martyrdom\" operations as avenging their own losses and Israel's settlement-building in the West Bank, territory wanted by Palestinians for a future state of their own.\nIn March and April 2004, Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and his successor Abdul Aziz al-Rantissi were assassinated in Israeli missile strikes in Gaza. \nThe death of Fatah leader Yasser Arafat that November saw the Palestinian Authority newly led by Mahmoud Abbas, who viewed Hamas rocket-fire as counter-productive. \nWhen Hamas scored a landslide victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006, the stage was set for a bitter power-struggle with Fatah.\nHamas resisted all efforts to get it to sign up to previous Palestinian agreements with Israel, as well as to recognise Israel's legitimacy and to renounce violence.\nHamas's charter defines historic Palestine - including present-day Israel - as Islamic land and it rules out any permanent peace with the Jewish state.\nThe document also repeatedly makes attacks on Jews as a people, drawing charges that the movement is anti-Semitic. \nIn 2017, Hamas produced a new policy document that softened some of its stated positions and used more measured language. \nThere was no recognition of Israel, but it did formally accept the creation of an interim Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem - what are known as pre-1967 lines.\nThe document also stresses that Hamas's struggle is not with Jews but with \"occupying Zionist aggressors\". Israel said the group was \"attempting to fool the world\".\nAs a result, the new Hamas-led government was subjected to tough economic and diplomatic sanctions by Israel and its allies in the West.  \nAfter Hamas ousted forces loyal to Fatah from Gaza in 2007, Israel tightened its blockade on the territory, and Palestinian rocket-fire and Israeli air strikes continued. Egypt also closed its border crossing with Gaza and has only opened it intermittently since.\nIsrael holds Hamas responsible for all attacks emanating from the strip, and the two sides have been in a constant state of conflict ranging from deadly incidents around the border to full-scale hostilities.\nThe deadliest round, in 2014, saw at least 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, killed during 50 days of fighting. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.\nMost recently, an 11-day conflict in May 2021 killed at least 256 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel before it ended with an Egyptian-brokered truce.\nRepeated attempts at reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah have failed, and the first Palestinian elections for 15 years, in which Hamas was due to compete, were called off by President Abbas in April 2021.\nMeanwhile, the humanitarian situation for the two million Palestinians in Gaza has deteriorated. The strip's economy has collapsed, and there are shortages of water, electricity and medicine. "

      "tags": "Travel,TUI Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Online travel agent On The Beach has stopped selling all holidays for this summer due to Covid uncertainty.\nThe pause in sales until September includes \"green list\" countries such as Portugal.\nBy contrast, EasyJet and Tui will begin offering holidays to countries classified as amber, despite government advice remaining not to travel for leisure.\nEasyJet said it would let people \"make up their own mind about their holiday\". \nMost countries are currently classed as amber, but it is not illegal to travel to them when holidays resume on 17 May for people in England and Scotland.\nInstead, arrivals from these places will be required to quarantine at home for 10 days and take a Covid test before departure and on arrival.\nHowever, On The Beach, one of the biggest UK online travel agents, said it would not be selling any holidays for June, July and August due to \"continuing uncertainty around international leisure travel\". \nThe firm's chief executive, Simon Cooper, said: \"There's nothing we want more than to be able to send customers on holiday, but with the current number of unknowns, we don't think that now is the right time for customers to book new holidays departing in the next few months.\"\nHe told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been \"jaded by the experience\" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions.\nMr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by \"administrative costs and loss of goodwill\".\nThe Foreign Office stopped advising against all but essential travel to a number of amber destinations last week. However, its advice is based on different criteria to the Department of Transport's advice.\nAt present, only 12 countries are on the government's \"green list\" for foreign holidays under the traffic light system for travel, meaning people are not required to quarantine when they get back. But they will need to take a Covid test before departure and another on arrival. \nBy contrast, those visiting amber countries such as Spain and France must take a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. They also need to quarantine at home for 10 days when they return.\nOn The Beach's Mr Cooper said it would not be offering foreign holidays to \"green list\" countries because \"it is very likely that we will see regular fluctuations in destinations' traffic light classifications\".\n\"Given this, there is too much uncertainty for us to take new bookings with confidence that they will go ahead, or for us to know the potential inconvenience or incremental costs that customers might experience or incur,\" he said.\n\"Unlike many of our competitors, we have no interest in selling holidays that are unlikely to happen, as our business model enables us to put customers first, rather than needing to get cash in the door to contribute to high fixed costs, and offering refunds in the form of a voucher when holidays get cancelled.\"\nSpeaking on Friday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that although holidays abroad would no longer be illegal from Monday 17 May, the government advised against travel to amber countries for leisure. \nHowever, Tui and EasyJet are still going to push ahead with their plans to offer holidays to \"amber list\" countries.\nAn EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that many our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday.\" \nShe added that EasyJet won't operate any holidays to destinations on the \"red\" list.\nTui's spokeswoman said: \"We want to offer our customers flexibility and choice this summer, so where borders are open and FCDO advice allows travel, we will operate to those destinations. \n\"We know some customers may be unsure about travelling this summer, so we've offered free changes 14 days before travel for anyone due to travel before the end of August.\"\nThe flurry of activity by the FCDO at the start of last week led a few to think that they had cracked which countries would be on the green list early. But they spoke too soon; while there is overlap the two are not the same. \nThe government would say the two lists each serve a different purpose. The Foreign office list is advice to help British travellers assess the risk posed to them if they travel to a country. The traffic light list is about stopping the virus and variants coming into the country.\nEssentially, one is about personal risk, one is about national risk. There is still a strong overlap between the two and the fact that the countries differ has still left some passengers and the industry scratching their heads. \nUnlike now, there will be no law stopping travellers from going to amber countries, just government advice not to do so for leisure. Doing so will mean quarantine on return and added cost for tests, which will put many off. But after low passenger numbers for over a year, some operators think that it's a price that certain passengers will be willing to pay.  \nAlso on Wednesday, Spain's Foreign Minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said the UK should take a regional approach when deciding which places should be on the green list. The country is on the amber list.\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \"We are having good discussions with the UK authorities to convince them there are many regions in Spain - Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Valencia - where the numbers are equivalent to those in the UK today.\n\"Maybe if the UK looks with a regional lens they will discover that there are many safe places already in Spain to travel to. Let's keep on working, but it's looking good for British tourists to spend their holidays in Spain this summer.\"\nShe said Spain was proceeding at pace with its vaccination effort and that over 30% of Spaniards had already received at least one shot, with six million were fully vaccinated. She said that the country was 98 days away from collective immunity.   \nIt comes as Tui reported reported a sharp jump in demand for holidays this winter as more people defer their holidays.\nAs of 2 May, bookings this year for winter 2021/22 breaks were up 17% on the same period in 2019. But total summer bookings were down 69% due to continued uncertainty over travel rules. \nNevertheless, TUI said it expected the safe return of holidays in the coming months. \n\"The continued vaccination progress across our key customer markets and destinations, combined with more testing, and comprehensive hygiene measures throughout our eco-system, should enable the safe return to holidays this summer,\" it said.\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, third lockdown and travel restrictions, Tui's revenues dived by 89% to \u20ac716m (\u00a3614.6m) in the six months to March.\nHowever, TUI said customers were keen to travel once Covid restrictions were fully lifted.\nIt said nearly three times as many Britons have decided to book with the travel giant for the summer of 2022 compared with 2019.\nThe travel operator said it was focused on reopening a portfolio of destinations strong vaccination coverage and low incidence rates, including the Greek islands, the Balearics, the Canaries and Portugal.

      "text": "Nearly two thirds of people in Wales are estimated to have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19.\nThe latest survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which took blood samples from nearly 1,000 people in Wales, estimated that 63.2% have antibodies present.\nBut this rises for older age groups up to an estimated 90% of those over 80.\nPresence of antibodies suggest people have either had the virus already or, in most cases, had a vaccine.\nFor the youngest age groups, where the vaccine roll-out has only recently started in Wales, 38% of 16 to 24-year-olds are estimated to have antibodies.\nThis then rises to 47.% of those aged between 35 to 49.\nBut the presence of antibodies is really noticeable for those aged 50 and above, where take-up of first doses of vaccine in Wales - according to Public Health Wales figures - is currently between 87 and 96%.\nThe proportion who were found to have antibodies to protect against Covid was 81.7% of those in their 50s, at least 81% for those in their 60s rising to 90.4% of those aged 80 and above.\nThe ONS survey has also modelled for individual ages - so estimates 20.4% of 16-year-olds and 39.4% of 25-year-olds have antibodies.\nIt also shows 66.4% of women have antibodies, compared to 59.7% of men. This gender gap is widest in the youngest age groups. \nAntibodies are a key part of our immune defences and stop the virus from getting inside the body's cells.\nHaving antibodies can help stop people being infected again although it's not yet known if it affects the chance of getting Covid again. Once infected or vaccinated, antibodies stay in the blood at low levels and can decline over time.\nWe can see in the survey too how antibody positivity can fall in age groups between first and second doses.\nOfficial statisticians said that across all UK nations, there was a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for Covid antibodies \"but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination\".\nThe survey does not include residents of care homes."

      "text": "Online travel agent On The Beach has stopped selling all holidays for this summer due to Covid uncertainty.\nThe pause in sales until September includes \"green list\" countries such as Portugal.\nBy contrast, EasyJet and Tui will begin offering holidays to countries classified as amber, despite government advice remaining not to travel for leisure.\nEasyJet said it would let people \"make up their own mind about their holiday\". \nMost countries are currently classed as amber, but it is not illegal to travel to them when holidays resume on 17 May for people in England and Scotland.\nInstead, arrivals from these places will be required to quarantine at home for 10 days and take a Covid test before departure and on arrival.\nHowever, On The Beach, one of the biggest UK online travel agents, said it would not be selling any holidays for June, July and August due to \"continuing uncertainty around international leisure travel\". \nThe firm's chief executive, Simon Cooper, said: \"There's nothing we want more than to be able to send customers on holiday, but with the current number of unknowns, we don't think that now is the right time for customers to book new holidays departing in the next few months.\"\nHe told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been \"jaded by the experience\" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions.\nMr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by \"administrative costs and loss of goodwill\".\nThe Foreign Office stopped advising against all but essential travel to a number of amber destinations last week. However, its advice is based on different criteria to the Department of Transport's advice.\nAt present, only 12 countries are on the government's \"green list\" for foreign holidays under the traffic light system for travel, meaning people are not required to quarantine when they get back. But they will need to take a Covid test before departure and another on arrival. \nBy contrast, those visiting amber countries such as Spain and France must take a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. They also need to quarantine at home for 10 days when they return.\nOn The Beach's Mr Cooper said it would not be offering foreign holidays to \"green list\" countries because \"it is very likely that we will see regular fluctuations in destinations' traffic light classifications\".\n\"Given this, there is too much uncertainty for us to take new bookings with confidence that they will go ahead, or for us to know the potential inconvenience or incremental costs that customers might experience or incur,\" he said.\n\"Unlike many of our competitors, we have no interest in selling holidays that are unlikely to happen, as our business model enables us to put customers first, rather than needing to get cash in the door to contribute to high fixed costs, and offering refunds in the form of a voucher when holidays get cancelled.\"\nSpeaking on Friday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that although holidays abroad would no longer be illegal from Monday 17 May, the government advised against travel to amber countries for leisure. \nHowever, Tui and EasyJet are still going to push ahead with their plans to offer holidays to \"amber list\" countries.\nAn EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that many our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday.\" \nShe added that EasyJet won't operate any holidays to destinations on the \"red\" list.\nTui's spokeswoman said: \"We want to offer our customers flexibility and choice this summer, so where borders are open and FCDO advice allows travel, we will operate to those destinations. \n\"We know some customers may be unsure about travelling this summer, so we've offered free changes 14 days before travel for anyone due to travel before the end of August.\"\nThe flurry of activity by the FCDO at the start of last week led a few to think that they had cracked which countries would be on the green list early. But they spoke too soon; while there is overlap the two are not the same. \nThe government would say the two lists each serve a different purpose. The Foreign office list is advice to help British travellers assess the risk posed to them if they travel to a country. The traffic light list is about stopping the virus and variants coming into the country.\nEssentially, one is about personal risk, one is about national risk. There is still a strong overlap between the two and the fact that the countries differ has still left some passengers and the industry scratching their heads. \nUnlike now, there will be no law stopping travellers from going to amber countries, just government advice not to do so for leisure. Doing so will mean quarantine on return and added cost for tests, which will put many off. But after low passenger numbers for over a year, some operators think that it's a price that certain passengers will be willing to pay.  \nAlso on Wednesday, Spain's Foreign Minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said the UK should take a regional approach when deciding which places should be on the green list. The country is on the amber list.\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \"We are having good discussions with the UK authorities to convince them there are many regions in Spain - Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Valencia - where the numbers are equivalent to those in the UK today.\n\"Maybe if the UK looks with a regional lens they will discover that there are many safe places already in Spain to travel to. Let's keep on working, but it's looking good for British tourists to spend their holidays in Spain this summer.\"\nShe said Spain was proceeding at pace with its vaccination effort and that over 30% of Spaniards had already received at least one shot, with six million were fully vaccinated. She said that the country was 98 days away from collective immunity.   \nIt comes as Tui reported reported a sharp jump in demand for holidays this winter as more people defer their holidays.\nAs of 2 May, bookings this year for winter 2021/22 breaks were up 17% on the same period in 2019. But total summer bookings were down 69% due to continued uncertainty over travel rules. \nNevertheless, TUI said it expected the safe return of holidays in the coming months. \n\"The continued vaccination progress across our key customer markets and destinations, combined with more testing, and comprehensive hygiene measures throughout our eco-system, should enable the safe return to holidays this summer,\" it said.\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, third lockdown and travel restrictions, Tui's revenues dived by 89% to \u20ac716m (\u00a3614.6m) in the six months to March.\nHowever, TUI said customers were keen to travel once Covid restrictions were fully lifted.\nIt said nearly three times as many Britons have decided to book with the travel giant for the summer of 2022 compared with 2019.\nThe travel operator said it was focused on reopening a portfolio of destinations strong vaccination coverage and low incidence rates, including the Greek islands, the Balearics, the Canaries and Portugal.

The ONS said it was driven by a police crackdown in \"crime hotspots\" from April to June 2020.\nThe Metropolitan Police in London was among the forces which ran more proactive drug operations targeting dealers and suppliers as they struggled to move around freely in lockdown."

      "text": "Fraud and error on the main universal credit benefit have reached record levels, according to new official figures. \nAccording to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), \u00a38.4bn was lost in 2020-21, up from \u00a34.6bn the previous year.\nOfficials say the rise is almost entirely due to fraud. \nThe number of people on universal credit has doubled to six million since the start of the pandemic. \nOfficials say the increase in universal credit fraud is a product of more people applying for the benefit, and the value of each fraudulent case rising, rather than a higher proportion of people engaging in fraud. \nThe overall level of fraud and error across the benefits system increased by almost two-thirds, from 2.4% last year to 3.9%, the highest ever reported rate. \nThe fraud rate on the main benefit, universal credit, has increased by more than 50% over the past year, and now stands at 14.5%. \nThe DWP says the vast majority of claims are genuine and the benefit provides a vital safety net for people in need. \nFraud can be as simple as individuals claiming money to which they are not entitled, for example by not declaring income from other sources.\nMore complex cases involve criminal gangs stealing people's details to apply for advance payments of universal credit. \nThe money is paid to them but the person whose identity has been stolen gets the bill.\nAs Covid-19 hit the UK last spring and the economy was effectively mothballed, the sheer demand for universal credit in March and April led the government to relax some welfare rules, which allowed criminal gangs to target the benefit and steal as much as \u00a31.5bn. \nIdentity checks were processed online, for instance, rather than face-to-face and some information was taken on trust, such as the cost of rent. \nIt was not until a letter from the DWP dropped through her door last November, demanding repayment of a \u00a31,475.52 universal credit advance, that Jo Darby, 37, realised she had a problem.\nMs Darby, from Birmingham, had been working full-time throughout the pandemic and had never claimed benefits, let alone an advance, so she immediately assumed fraud. \nBut convincing the DWP proved difficult - there was no reply on the helpline number on the letter and when the fraud team eventually called back, they refused to talk to her because she was unable to verify the security questions on the scam universal credit account.\nTwo weeks later Ms Darby's employer told her they had been instructed to deduct money from her salary. \n\"I felt like I was going round in circles and had no control,\" she told the BBC.\n\"They hadn't taken on my concerns regarding the fraud and they'd already started to recover that debt without fully investigating the situation.\" \nIt took the intervention of BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme to resolve the situation.\nMs Darby later discovered the original fraud actually happened in June.\n\"For all that time, someone was pretending to be me and there were no significant checks in place,\" she says. \nOther factors in 2020 include confusion among many new claimants, who applied for both universal credit and the government's Self Employment Income Support Scheme - income from the scheme can mean claimants should receive less universal credit. \nOfficials also say pre-pandemic concerns that the rules around declaring capital and savings are complex and driving high levels of fraud and error have not been addressed and are becoming more acute as the number of people claiming universal credit rockets.  \nReacting to the figures, a DWP official said \"following an unprecedented year... fraud and error in the benefits system remains low with 95% of benefits worth more than \u00a3200bn paid correctly. \n\"We take any abuse of taxpayers' money very seriously and those who claim benefits they are untitled to will face criminal prosecution. \n\"We also have robust plans in place to recover fraudulent claims and drive fraud and error down to the lowest feasible level.\"\n Have you been a victim of universal credit fraud?

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Tel Aviv,Palestinian territories",
      "text": "\"Civil war has broken out in Lod.\"\nThat is how Mayor Yair Revivo described the situation after violence exploded in the mixed Arab-Jewish Israeli town, lying 15km (9 miles) south-east of Tel Aviv.\nProtests by Israeli Arabs in the town turned into full-scale riots on Tuesday night. Demonstrators clashed with police and set cars and buildings ablaze, the day after a funeral for a man allegedly shot dead by Jewish residents.\n\"This is a complete loss of control,\" Mr Revivo told Israel's Channel 12 News. \"Synagogues are being burned. Hundreds of cars set alight... The situation is incendiary.\"\nViolence also flared in other cities and towns with sizeable Arab populations - including neighbouring Ramle, Acre, Jaffa, Jisr al-Zarqa and Umm al-Fahm. Police arrested 270 people.\n\"The sight of the pogrom in Lod and the disturbances across the country by an incited and bloodthirsty Arab mob, injuring people, damaging property and even attacking sacred Jewish spaces is unforgiveable,\" President Reuven Rivlin said on Wednesday.\nHe added: \"The silence of the Arab leadership about these disturbances is shameful, giving support to terrorism and rioting and encouraging the rupture of the society in which we live and in which we will continue to live once all this has passed.\"\nA number of Israeli Arab politicians have called for an end to the rioting. \n\"Protests in Arab society are moving in a very dangerous direction, as popular protests have escalated into violence,\" Raam party leader Mansour Abbas was quoted as saying in Haaretz newspaper on Wednesday. \"I call on everyone to behave responsibly and to adhere to the rule of law.\"\nThe unrest follows days of high tensions in Jerusalem, with clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians at a key holy site, and escalating hostilities between Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the the Israeli military since Monday night that have left more than 50 people dead.\nIn recent days, Israeli Arabs have staged protests in sympathy with Palestinians in Jerusalem and Gaza. \nDuring protests on Monday in Lod - a third of whose population is Arab - an Arab resident in his 30s, Musa Hassuna, was shot dead and another person seriously injured.\nHaaretz cited a Jewish resident as saying an \"Arab crowd tried to break into the neighbourhood\", and that his neighbours \"were forced to shoot in the air\" because they felt in danger. \nMr Hassuna's father said his son had not gone to protest and that he had been passing through the area when \"they shot him at point-blank\". \nPolice arrested three suspects, who said they had acted in self-defence. \nHundreds attended Mr Hassuna's funeral on Tuesday. Clashes soon broke out with the police, and Israeli media reported that two officers were injured and a police car was set on fire. \nAs night fell the violence escalated and synagogues and businesses were attacked. Reuters news agency said there were also reports of Jews stoning a car driven by an Arab.\nSocial media footage allegedly showed protesters firing on police with an automatic weapon. Officers responded with live rounds. \n\"This is the first time we've seen local residents using weapons, opening fire, and the response from our units has been also using live fire in order to prevent anyone from being killed,\" police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said.\nHaaretz newspaper reports that 12 people were injured in the unrest, with one in a serious condition. \nSeparately, a 52-year-old father and his 16-year-old daughter were killed when a Palestinian rocket fired from Gaza hit their car in Lod. Khalil and Nadin Awad were both Israeli Arabs.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now declared a state of emergency in Lod, granting police more powers there. It is reportedly the first time since 1966 the government has used emergency powers over an Arab community. \n\"It's anarchy from rioters and we cannot accept it,\" Mr Netanyahu told reporters on a visit to the town early on Wednesday, vowing to \"restore law and order with an iron fist\".\n\"I don't feel safe exiting my home,\" Jewish resident Lior Benisti told Channel 12. \"We wanted to go to my sister, we have two small daughters and we decided to stay in tonight even though we don't have a rocket-proof room. Better take the risk of rockets than the mayhem outside.\"\nIn total, about 21% of Israel's population are Israeli Arabs - about 1.96 million people, according to a December report by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. \nDuring the war that surrounded the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, hundreds of thousands of Arabs were forced from or fled their homes. Those who stayed in what became Israel, and their descendants, have been granted citizenship and are known as Israeli Arabs.\nAbout 80% of Israeli Arabs are Muslim, with the rest identifying as either Christian or Druze. Most identify strongly with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, with many calling themselves \"Palestinian citizens of Israel\".\nIsrael's government says its Arab citizens have equal social and political rights, although they are exempt from compulsory military service. \nBut Israeli Arabs themselves say they are treated as second-class citizens who face legal, institutional and social discrimination.\nAuthorities in Lod built a 3m-high (10ft) wall through a part of the town in 2010, separating the Jewish and Arab communities. Officials said it was to reduce crime, but Israeli Arabs said it was an attempt at enforcing segregation."

      "tags": "Belfast,Brandon Lewis,Boris Johnson,Michelle O'Neill,The Troubles,Ballymurphy inquest",
      "text": "Relatives of the Ballymurphy victims have spoken of their anger over a written apology from the prime minister. \nAn inquest has found 10 people, who were shot in the wake of an Army operation in Belfast, were \"entirely innocent\".\nFamilies received the letter from Boris Johnson on Thursday morning. \nJohn Teggart, whose father Daniel was among the victims, said the tone and timing of the apology was unacceptable.\nHe said the letter was received minutes before Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis apologised in Parliament for \"the events at Ballymurphy\" in 1971.\nIn a statement made after the families met to discuss the apology, Mr Teggart said: \"The feeling in the room was anger. That's the emotion coming through from all the family members - anger.\" \nHe added: \"It's the manner of the apology, sending a letter two minutes before the secretary of state went live on TV. It's the timing. \n\"We hadn't asked for an apology. The words he put forward meant nothing.\" \nMr Teggart said Mr Johnson should have consulted with families about the contents of the letter. \n\"The manner in which he has done this is totally unacceptable.\n\"We want Boris Johnson in the dispatch box, speaking to Parliament and to the world about what's happened in Ballymurphy. And we don't want him in the second line to start talking about a statute of limitations, taking away from what we have achieved.\"\nMr Teggart said the next step was to make \"somebody responsible for [those] who killed our loved ones\".\nJanet Donnelly, whose father Joseph Murphy was killed in Ballymurphy, said Mr Johnson \"didn't have the nerve to go into the House of Commons and make an apology himself\". \n\"If he was in any way sincere with this, he should have done it right and he should have done it himself.\"\nCarmel Quinn, the sister of victim John Laverty, expressed anger at the PM's use of the words \"the events\" to describe what happened. \n\"It wasn't an event, it was an event. It was mass murder of a civilian population,\" she said. \nIn his statement earlier on Thursday, Mr Lewis said the UK government \"profoundly regrets and is truly sorry\" for what happened in Ballymurphy. \nHe said this also extended to the families for the \"additional pain\" they have had to endure and at how investigations were handled.\nBriege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the families felt like they were being treated like \"second class citizens\" after discovering from a journalist that Mr Lewis was making the statement.\n\"Why could Boris not do it? Why could he not have stood up and give that apology?\" she asked, in an interview with BBC NI's Talkback programme. \n\"Brandon Lewis is just like a puppet for Boris.\"\nMr Lewis had told Parliament Mr Johnson was writing to the families.        \nHe said there was \"no doubt what happened on those awful few days in Ballymurphy fuelled further violence and escalation, particularly in the early years of the Troubles\".\n\"This government profoundly regrets and is truly sorry for these events, at how investigations after these terrible events were handled and for the additional pain that the families have had to endure in their fight to clear the names of their loved ones, since they began their campaign almost five decades ago,\" Mr Lewis said. \nOn Wednesday, Downing Street said Boris Johnson had apologised to Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers in a phone call.\nHowever, on Thursday, Sinn F\u00e9in President Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during that call.\nSpeaking of his subsequent letter, she added: \"A second hand apology is no apology at all.\"\nMs McDonald called on Mr Johnson to meet the families, who had shown \"courage, dignity, resilience and stamina\".\n\"I think Boris Johnson could do well to borrow from these families some of that dignity and the British system needs to recognise what happened here.\" \nBut some victims' families said the remarks should have been made in public.\nOn Thursday, Mr Lewis told Parliament he wanted \"to put on record the government's acknowledgement of the terrible hurt\" caused to the Ballymurphy families. \nAmong the Ballymurphy victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded, a mother-of-eight and a former soldier who had lost his hand in World War Two.\nNine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said.\nHowever, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr.\nMr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened. \n\"The families of those who were killed should never have had to experience the grief and trauma of that loss,\" Mr Lewis said. \n\"Above all, they should not have had to wait nearly five decades for the judgement this week, nor have been compelled to relive that terrible time in August 1971, again and again in their long and distressing quest for truth.\"\nHe added that the desire for families of victims to know the truth about what happened to their loved ones was \"strong and legitimate\".\n\"Mr Speaker, this government wants to deliver a way forward in addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, which will allow all individuals or families who want information, to seek and receive answers about what happened during the Troubles, with far less delay and distress,\" he said. \n\"We want a path forward which will also pave the way for wider societal reconciliation for all communities, allowing all the people of Northern Ireland to focus on building a shared, stable, peaceful, and prosperous future.\"\nA number of MPs, responding to Mr Lewis, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have delivered the apology to Parliament. \nThe Downing Street statement on Wednesday said the prime minister \"apologised unreservedly on behalf of the UK government for the events that took place in Ballymurphy and the huge anguish that the lengthy pursuit of truth has caused the families of those killed\". \nShadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh told Parliament the fact that families have had to wait for so long was a \"profound failure of justice\". \n\"In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, David Cameron came to this House and apologised in a statement. He took full responsibility,\" she said. \n\"Where is the prime minister today and why has he not publicly apologised to the Ballymurphy families and to this House?\"\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Gregory Campbell asked the secretary of state to ensure that the Ballymurphy families, or those of IRA killings, do not \"suffer the ignominy of hearing about an amnesty\". \nThe government is to bring forward legislation in the course of the next year to deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles.\nBased on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations.\nMr Lewis said it was important for the state to takes accountability for what happened in Northern Ireland, but added that it is important that \"we get to the heart of what happened\".\nAmnesty is a word which dare not cross the lips of government as it sets out its latest change of approach around the legacy of the Troubles.\nThere has yet to be a clear, public enunciation of what is proposed.\nBut it is this: a statute of limitations which would ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles.\nNot just future cases, but potentially, those already in train.\nIt would apply across the board - to army veterans and former paramilitaries - on everything which happened before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.\nThe plan is the outworking of the government's pledge to protect soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.\nInitial talks have taken place with political parties and meetings are planned with victims' groups.\nSources have told BBC News NI that there were many questions, but very few detailed answers from the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis.\nThe plan has been met with loud opposition.\nAlready, many are jumping ahead to whether the government, with the numbers at Westminster, will legislate regardless.\nThe legacy plan would involve some form of investigations for families of the bereaved.\nBut they would be investigations for the purposes of information recovery, not prosecutions.\nThe government believes this is the key.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Ballymurphy deaths were \"sheer bloody murder\". \n\"Will the secretary of state ask the prime minister to come out of hiding, come with me, meet the Ballymurphy families and tell them to their faces why he wants to protect the killers?\"\nMr Lewis said the government would consider the report in more detail.\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry said he wanted to focus on the \"courage and dignity\" of the families affected. \n\"Does it [Mr Lewis' apology] also include how the British Army libelled many of the victims by calling them IRA gunmen and also how the Ministry of Defence, and some individual soldiers, frustrated the process of justice over many years?\" he asked. \nDenis Bradley, co-author of the Consultative Group on the Past Report in 2009, said a statute of limitations was \"possibly workable\" as court action to deal with the Troubles had led to a \"hierarchy\" for victims.\n\"For everybody who gets into a court or into a coroner's inquest, there will be 50 victims who won't get in there,\" he told BBC News NI's The View programme.\nMr Bradley, a former priest, worked with Lord Eames, a former Church of Ireland archbishop, to produce a document on ways to deal with legacy.\nOn Thursday, he said the criminal justice system \"is not the place to do the past\".\n\"The past has become a swamp for everybody and there's very little solid ground on which to build a resolution and a solution,\" he added.\nMr Bradley added that what many victims were searching for was \"information\" rather than court proceedings."

      "text": "David Cameron has said he was paid \"far more\" as a part-time adviser to now-collapsed Greensill Capital than when he was prime minister.\nHe told MPs he had had a \"big economic investment\" in the finance company, including shares.\nBut he insisted he was not motivated by money when he lobbied ministers on behalf of the firm - and he believed he had acted in the national interest.\nMr Cameron was paid \u00a3150,402 a year when he quit as prime minister in 2016.\nSpeaking via video link to the Treasury Select Committee, he repeatedly declined to reveal his exact salary at Greensill, which he joined two years after leaving Downing Street, calling it a \"private matter\".\nThe panel of MPs is among three parliamentary committees that have launched inquiries into the company, following its collapse in March.\nMr Cameron told the Treasury Committee he had not broken any rules when he tried to influence ministers and officials on behalf of Greensill Capital around the start of the Covid pandemic in spring last year. \nHe said it had been \"appropriate\" for him to call and text ministers and officials directly, as financial schemes were being designed quickly at a \"time of extraordinary crisis\".\nBut he conceded that in future \"prime ministers should only ever use letter or email, and should restrict themselves far more\".\nAnd he backed a tightening up of the rules for ministers and officials who take jobs in industry.\nMr Cameron has previously said he began working as a \"part-time senior adviser\" to Greensill Capital in August 2018.\n\"I was paid an annual amount, a generous annual amount, far more than what I earned as prime minister, and I had shares - not share options but shares in the business - which vested over the period of time of my contract,\" he told the committee.\nHe described reports he had been set to make \u00a360m from Greensill before its collapse as \"completely absurd\".\nMr Cameron also said the demise of Greensill Capital was a \"great regret\" to him, and there were \"important lessons to be learned\" from it.\nHe added that he had conducted \"quite a lot of due diligence\" before taking up the advisory role, including asking questions about \"every aspect of the business\".\nWhat is lobbying?\n\"I had a big economic investment in the future of Greensill, so I wanted the business to succeed,\" Mr Cameron told MPs. \"I wanted it to grow.\"\nHe said his economic interest in the firm had been \"important\" but was not relevant to the MPs' inquiry into its collapse and its contacts with government. \nAnd he said he had felt the firm's proposals would help small businesses access cash during an economic crisis, and were \"absolutely in the public interest\".\nIn a separate hearing, with the the Public Accounts Committee, Mr Cameron said he had only learned that Greensill Capital was in financial difficulty towards the end of last year.\nHe added that the past few months, during which his work for the company has come in for widespread criticism, had been \"very difficult\", but said he felt more sorry for the hundreds of staff who had lost their jobs.\nThe former prime minister repeatedly texted ministers and officials, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, asking for the firm to be included in a Covid-related government loan scheme.\nBut his attempts to involve Greensill in the Covid Corporate Financing Facility were ultimately unsuccessful after they were rebuffed by the Treasury."

      "text": "Travel companies have been warned they must be ready to refund consumers if foreign holidays are cancelled by the coronavirus pandemic this summer.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said it had reminded package holiday firms of their legal obligations.\nIn 2020, cancelled trips resulted in 23,000 complaints to the competition watchdog.\nThe CMA said it had taken action against five big firms, which had now refunded a total of \u00a3200m.\nThese included Tui, which the watchdog said had now formally committed to giving clearer information about refunds upfront.\nThe others were Teletext Holidays, LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com and Virgin Holidays.\nThe UK government has said people can travel abroad again from 17 May, but destinations will be ranked for safety under a traffic light system and there are fears their status could change unexpectedly. \n\"We're calling on package holiday companies to make the refund process less hassle in the future,\" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. \n\"We expect all firms to give clear cancellation options and will consider appropriate steps if we see companies breaking the law by refusing or delaying refunds this summer.\"\nUnder package holiday rules, cancelled holidays must be refunded within 14 days and customers must be offered a refund, not just a credit note.\nSince the start of the pandemic, many people have faced last-minute cancellations of flights and holidays as travel restrictions were imposed.\nSome agreed to defer their holidays to a later date and accepted credit notes, but others who wanted their money back found it difficult to get refunds.\nAs the pandemic stretched on, others who had initially agreed to put off their holidays changed their minds and decided they did want a refund after all, but experienced reluctance from travel firms.\nThe CMA said any offer of a refund credit note had to be accompanied by the option of a full refund, while customers should be able to exchange their credit note for a refund at any time.\nFollowing customer complaints, the CMA has stepped in. It said at the end of last month that Teletext faced court action unless it paid more than \u00a37m in refunds.\nLastminute.com had been facing legal action in connection with \u00a31m worth of unpaid refunds, but the CMA said in February that the money had since been repaid.\nThe watchdog has now secured refund commitments from the other firms.\nPeople will be able to travel for leisure again from Monday, but holidays to most destinations require a period of quarantine when holidaymakers return home.\nPortugal is the main holiday destination currently on the \"green list\", but the travel industry is worried that countries could be added or withdrawn at short notice.\nThe government has advised against leisure travel to \"amber list\" countries, but Tui and EasyJet are still planning to offer holidays to some of those destinations.\nAn EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that many of our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday.\"\nShe added that EasyJet would not operate any holidays to destinations on the \"red\" list.\nOn Wednesday, online travel agent On The Beach said it had stopped selling all holidays for this summer because of Covid uncertainty.\nChief executive Simon Cooper told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been \"jaded by the experience\" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions.\nMr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by \"administrative costs and loss of goodwill\"."

These include 28 to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays.\nThe UEFA Champions League final in Porto has not yet been officially announced, but is widely expected after Portugal's government agreed to allow a limited number of fans to attend, despite this not yet being the case at domestic games.\nMs Vieira da Silva said that a series of restrictions would apply.\nThere will be a 12,000 limit on numbers and tickets will be for named people in designated seats, which will spaced in line with health guidelines.\nFans will have to fly in on charters, arriving and leaving \"on the same day\" in what Ms Vieira da Silva described as \"a bubble situation\" - passing through a separate zone at the airport, as well as having to take a coronavirus test before travelling."

      "text": "People in Wales will be able to travel to a small list of countries from Monday without going into quarantine when they get back.\nBut despite adopting the traffic-light system used in England, ministers are advising people not to go abroad.\nThe first minister warned it was \"best avoided\" because of concerns travellers could bring Covid with them.\nMeanwhile, he revealed he had planned to go further in easing Covid rules but paused because of the Indian variant.\nPlans to allow pubs to trade indoors, and for cinemas and museums to reopen, will go ahead from Monday. \nMinisters had considered relaxing lockdown restrictions further on the same, but Mark Drakeford said officials had \"decided to hold back\" for more advice.\nHe told the BBC he had been considering allowing \"some small events\" and \"greater mixing between people not in a household\".\nBoth are now on hold.\nExperts are concerned the variant has mutations that may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective.\nA total of 26 cases of two variants first identified in India had been found in Wales as of last Thursday - including 11 of a type identified by officials as a \"variant of concern\".\nA total of 1,313 cases of the variant of concern have been identified in the UK.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Friday evening the wait between jabs will be cut from 12 weeks to eight for the over-50s and clinically vulnerable because of concern over the Indian variant.\nThe change does not apply in Wales and the Welsh government said it will continue with the rollout as planned.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We have considered the latest evidence and advice from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation].\n\"Given the low numbers of the Indian variant and the high numbers of people in Wales already vaccinated, we are confident that our vaccination programme already has the flexibility it needs to respond swiftly and effectively and are not making any changes at this stage.\"\nPeople in England and Scotland can take holidays abroad in a small number of so-called \"green\" countries - including Portugal, Israel and Singapore - without having to quarantine when they return.  \nWales will be adopting the same \"traffic light\" system, with countries classified as green, amber and red.\nIt means people will be able to travel to a small number of foreign destinations in the green list without the need to quarantine on their return.\nMandatory quarantine for countries not on the green list remains in place, and visitors to red list countries will need to book hotels on their return.\nEveryone who travels will need to book at least one test on their return.\nHowever, the Welsh government said it would continue to advise people to only travel for essential purposes.\nMr Drakeford said: \"This is the year to take your holiday in Wales and foreign travel is best avoided.\"\nHe admitted his travel advice was not a rule because it would be \"unenforceable\". He urged caution against \"importing\" coronavirus from other parts of the world.\n\"We know most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from Bristol, Manchester, London, so once those airports are open and travel across the UK is allowed, then people from Wales will be able to travel,\" he said.\nMr Drakeford told a press conference on Friday he did not want to \"make people feel guilty\" about going abroad, but urged people to \"think of their own safety and the safety of others\", adding there were \"fantastic opportunities\" to take a holiday in Wales instead.\nFrom 24 May, a \"paper-based vaccination status\" will be available for people in Wales who have had two doses of vaccination and need to urgently travel to a country that requires Covid vaccination proof. \nA UK government app that will act as a vaccine passport is due to be available in England on Monday, but the first minister said there was likely to be a four-week gap before it could be used in Wales due to technical reasons.\nMr Drakeford told the press conference Wales would move to Covid alert level two from Monday, meaning:  \nFrom 24 May, restrictions on numbers of visitors to care homes will be eased.\nMr Drakeford said that, if the situation remained positive at the start of June, he would look at whether Wales could move to alert level one.\nBut he warned he may need to delay that because of the Indian variant.\nThis move would include \"looking at relaxing the rules further around people meeting in their own homes, increasing the number of people able to attend wedding receptions and restarting larger events\".\nEllen Morris, the owner of two pubs in Bala, Gwynedd, welcomed the relaxation of the rules but said it would be difficult to police rules which dictate only six people from six different household can meet.\n\"They are grown adults - they should be able to decide, it shouldn't be me telling them you can do this,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"They call it hospitality - I don't feel I'm being very hospitable these days. We are talking about people's mental health here. It's been a long enough year without being left out of groups.\"\nMr Drakeford said social distancing rules in hospitality venues could be lifted if transmissions continued to fall.\nDJ Stacey Alford, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, has been receiving support from the UK government's freelancers' fund and Universal Credit.\nShe said she had been \"extremely cautious\" and followed the rules very closely, but was frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England.\n\"My bugbear is we can't even do things like background noise, so those opportunities are gone, but DJs in England are able to do that.\"\nThe relaxation will also mean indoor play centres can open, and indoor wedding ceremonies of up to 30 people can take place.\nGail Windley, a wedding planner from Swansea, welcomed the news but said it would still mean weddings would be too small for most couples, and criticised a lack of clarity about further easing.\nCharmaine Heydenrych, who owns a soft play centre in Cardiff, said she was \"ready\" to open but said being limited to 30 people was \"not sustainable\".\nWelsh Conservative Russell George welcomed the move to level two but said the Welsh government \"should have outlined a roadmap to give hope to businesses and communities\". \n\"It is concerning that the Welsh Government has indicated that social distancing and mask wearing will be required into the Autumn. \n\"What people really want is for the Welsh and UK governments to work together, to end the confusion over different restrictions in the two countries, especially as the virus does not recognise borders.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the first minister's call for people to holiday in Wales rather than go aboard.\n\"It's a positive message - we need it for the economy as well. It's not just about greater health protection but also supporting tourism and hospitality businesses which have had a torrid time\".\nMr Price said the sector still needed further financial support: \"What is the plan for the months ahead for hospitality?\". \nThe 26 cases of two variants first fouind in India are \"almost entirely the result of international travel\", the first minister said.\nMr Drakeford said those infected were \"people coming back to Wales from overseas\" and all cases were being carefully monitored by local public health teams.\n\"All the information I have had is that the individuals involved are following all the advice that they are required to follow, self-isolating and so on,\" he said.\n\"And the advice I have is not that we need to be overly concerned about the position in Wales at the moment.\"\nDr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines in Wales, told BBC Wales \"we're not led to believe that it will evade the vaccine at this point\".\nPublic Health Wales told BBC Wales it was not identifying where the 11 variant of concern cases were \"due to the risk of small number identification\".\nDr Robin Howe, incident director for Public Health Wales, said the majority of cases were associated with travel or with known contact, with the remainder still under investigation."

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Jerusalem",
      "text": "The latest round of violence between Israelis and Palestinians is happening because the long and unresolved conflict between the two sides has once again been left to fester. It is an open wound in the heart of the Middle East and it is why violent face-to-face confrontations have escalated into rocket-firing, air strikes and death.\nJust because the conflict has fallen out of international headlines in recent years does not mean that it has ended. The issues do not change, neither does the hatred and bitterness that not years but generations of trouble and killing have engendered. \nFor more than a century, Jews and Arabs have struggled to be the masters of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. Israel has inflicted a series of crushing defeats on the Palestinians since it became independent in 1948, but it still cannot win.  \nWhile the conflict goes on neither side can be secure. The one certainty is that every few years, at least, there will be a serious and violent crisis. The pattern over the past 15 years or so has often involved confrontation across the wire separating Gaza from Israel. \nThis time there has been a reminder that events in Jerusalem and its holy sites have an unmatched capacity to ignite violence. \nThe city's sanctity for Christians, Jews and Muslims is not just a religious matter. The Jewish and Muslim holy places are national symbols too. Geographically they are, literally, a stone's throw apart. The Holy Sepulchre church is close by, on the other side of an Israeli checkpoint, venerated by Palestinian Christians.  \nThe triggers included threats to evict Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah. It is a Palestinian neighbourhood outside the walls of the Old City, with land and property claimed by Jewish settler groups in the Israeli courts.  \nThat was more than a dispute over a handful of homes. It comes after years of successive Israeli governments pursuing the strategic objective of making Jerusalem more Jewish. Big settlements for Jews were built on occupied land to ring the city, breaking international law. In recent years the government and settler groups have worked to settle Jewish Israelis in Palestinian areas near the walled Old City on a house-by-house basis. \nAdded to that in the past few weeks was heavy-handed Israeli policing of Palestinians during Ramadan, culminating with the use of CS gas and stun grenades inside al-Aqsa mosque, the holiest place for Muslims after Mecca and Medina. \nHamas took the unusual step for them of issuing an ultimatum to Israel to remove its forces from the al-Aqsa compound and from Sheikh Jarrah, and then fired rockets at Jerusalem. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that \"the terrorist organisations in Gaza crossed a red line... Israel will respond with great force\". \nAnother combination of events could have ended up the same way. Violent events will happen again and again while the conflict is left unresolved. \nI was asked by a BBC presenter on Monday, as the crisis was escalating, when was the last time I found any sense of hope in Jerusalem that the two sides would find a way to co-exist in peace. I lived in Jerusalem from 1995 to 2000 and have been back since many, many times. \nFinding an answer was difficult. At the high point of the Oslo peace process in the 1990s there was a brief moment of hope but only residents of Jerusalem who are the wrong side of 40 years old or so will have much of a memory of how it felt. \nLeaders on both sides have been fighting their own domestic political battles, concentrating on safeguarding their own positions, when the biggest issue for any Palestinian or Israeli leader should be making peace. That challenge has not been addressed seriously for years. \nSome new ideas have emerged. Two respected think tanks, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the US/Middle East Project have just released a joint report arguing that the first priority should be equal rights and equal security for both Palestinians and Israelis. \nIt says the United States should support \"full equality and enfranchisement for all those residing in the territory under Israeli control; it will not endorse two separate and unequal systems\".\nNew thinking is good. This week though old realities, familiar rhetoric and the latest inevitable eruption of a century-long conflict are drowning everything else out. "

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nBoris Johnson has said he is \"anxious\" about a Covid variant first detected in India and is \"ruling nothing out\" to tackle its spread in the UK.  Surge vaccination - focusing extra doses of the vaccine to specific areas to immunise a larger section of the population - could be one of the options. The India variant is one of four mutated versions of coronavirus designated as being \"of concern\". You can read more about the variants here.\nTravel companies have been warned they must be ready to refund consumers if foreign holidays are cancelled by the pandemic this summer. The Competition and Markets Authority received 23,000 complaints last year because of cancelled trips - and took action against five big firms, who have now refunded \u00a3200m. This year, the watchdog has reminded package holiday firms of their legal obligations. The UK government has said people can travel abroad again from Monday, but destinations will be ranked according to risk - and there are fears their status could change suddenly.\nCrime recorded by police in England and Wales in 2020 fell by 8%, with lockdown causing theft reports to drop by more than a quarter, new figures show. The Office for National Statistics figures also showed firearms offences fell by 11% and knife crime by 9%. But reports of domestic abuse increased, as did fraud based on online shopping.\nThe NHS contact-tracing app prevented hundreds of thousands of coronavirus cases - and thousands of deaths - researchers have predicted. The findings, in a peer-reviewed paper, also included the fact that on average, each confirmed case of the virus who consented to their contacts being notified through the app prevented one new case. Some of the researchers were themselves involved in the creation of the NHS contact-tracing app, and had previously released some of the estimates. But the inclusion in the journal Nature means the paper has now been peer-reviewed by other academics. The app has been used regularly by 16.5 million people since its launch in September, figures show.\nThe Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City is to take place in Porto, Portugal. It was due to be held in Istanbul but Turkey was then placed on England's red list for travel. The final, on 29 May, will be attended by 6,000 fans from each club - and because Portugal is on the green list, they will not have to quarantine. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said depriving fans of watching the match in person was \"not an option\". \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind out more about which age groups are now being offered a coronavirus vaccine across the UK with our explainer here.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Nearly two thirds of people in Wales are estimated to have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19.\nThe latest survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which took blood samples from nearly 1,000 people in Wales, estimated that 63.2% have antibodies present.\nBut this rises for older age groups up to an estimated 90% of those over 80.\nPresence of antibodies suggest people have either had the virus already or, in most cases, had a vaccine.\nFor the youngest age groups, where the vaccine roll-out has only recently started in Wales, 38% of 16 to 24-year-olds are estimated to have antibodies.\nThis then rises to 47.% of those aged between 35 to 49.\nBut the presence of antibodies is really noticeable for those aged 50 and above, where take-up of first doses of vaccine in Wales - according to Public Health Wales figures - is currently between 87 and 96%.\nThe proportion who were found to have antibodies to protect against Covid was 81.7% of those in their 50s, at least 81% for those in their 60s rising to 90.4% of those aged 80 and above.\nThe ONS survey has also modelled for individual ages - so estimates 20.4% of 16-year-olds and 39.4% of 25-year-olds have antibodies.\nIt also shows 66.4% of women have antibodies, compared to 59.7% of men. This gender gap is widest in the youngest age groups. \nAntibodies are a key part of our immune defences and stop the virus from getting inside the body's cells.\nHaving antibodies can help stop people being infected again although it's not yet known if it affects the chance of getting Covid again. Once infected or vaccinated, antibodies stay in the blood at low levels and can decline over time.\nWe can see in the survey too how antibody positivity can fall in age groups between first and second doses.\nOfficial statisticians said that across all UK nations, there was a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for Covid antibodies \"but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination\".\nThe survey does not include residents of care homes."

      "tags": "PTSD",
      "text": "MDMA - most commonly known as a party drug - could be more effective than therapy alone at treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \nThe results of a keenly-awaited trial suggest two-thirds of people no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis after treatment.\nThe study represents a significant step towards approval of the drug in the US. \nBut UK experts warn against overhyping MDMA's potential, saying more research is needed to understand its effects.   \nPTSD can be the result of a very distressing or frightening event, or longer-term series of experiences. That might include accidents, abuse, rape, combat or illness. \nAnd it can be very difficult to treat.\nThis trial, run by US charity the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), found 88% of people had a \"meaningful reduction in symptoms\" and 67% no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis at all after 18 weeks and three sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy. \nTalking therapy alone led to a significant improvement in 60%, and remission in 32% of people. \nThe participants in the study, which was published in the journal Nature, had suffered from PTSD for an average of 14 years. \nWhile scientists acknowledge these findings provide important evidence in MDMA's favour, they are based on just 91 people. And since they were self-selecting (they volunteered for the study), they may not be representative of all trauma survivors. \nThe trial also compared MDMA with a type of therapy not recommended by the NHS for trauma, making the comparison less useful, according to some UK psychiatrists.  \nMDMA appears to work in part by calming the amygdala - the part of the brain which acts as a smoke alarm, telling the body to prepare for danger.\nIn people with PTSD and anxiety disorders, this part of the brain can overreact, sounding the alarm over seemingly small events (slight noises, changes of tone or facial expression, for example). \nThe Maps researchers suggest flooding the brain with feel-good hormones like serotonin at the same time as dampening its response to fear, might allow people to face and deal with painful memories without becoming overwhelmed.\n\"At its core, PTSD is a disorder of memory\", said Dr Michael Bloomfield, a consultant psychiatrist at University College London (UCL).\nWhen we are babies, and again during adolescence, we experience periods where our brains are very pliable - they grow and change much more than they're generally capable of in adulthood, and we can form lots of new connections. \nThe scientists involved in the study speculate that psychedelics and similar-acting drugs like MDMA might allow a \"reopening\" of this critical window of brain development, during which therapy can help healthier connections form.  \nThe Maps researchers said commonly prescribed antidepressants were ineffective for 40-60% of sufferers. But in the UK, talking therapy rather than medication is generally recommended as the first way of treating PTSD.\nDr Bloomfield at UCL said the treatment most recommended for trauma involves a therapist actively working with an individual to relive and process traumatic memories. But the therapy used in the study was closer to counselling, involving empathetic but mostly passive listening. \nThis makes it difficult to say whether MDMA-assisted therapy works better than trauma-focused therapy on its own, he explained. \nPositive expectations might also be driving some of the effects, Dr Bloomfield said, since the patients who volunteered to take part in the study were likely to have an existing interest in the drug. \nAlthough the study used a placebo group to help correct the effect of positive expectations, it's difficult to \"blind\" someone to the fact they've been given a drug like MDMA, which causes a strong and fairly immediate reaction. \nNevertheless, while more research is needed, Dr Bloomfield described the study as \"very exciting\", providing further evidence MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be helpful for people with PTSD. \nGuy Goodwin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, also flagged the study's relatively small sample size and self-selecting patients as limiting what the findings can tell us. \nBut he agreed the study \"adds to the growing conviction that drugs producing psychedelic effects have real potential in the treatment of severe mood and anxiety disorders\".\nMany psychedelic studies are exploratory - early-stage research investigating the potential of various drugs but remaining a long way from actually being available to prescribe. \nBut the Maps research is what is known as a phase three trial - the final hurdle before investigators can apply for the drug to be approved and therefore becomes available to patients.\nThe study was designed and conducted with the approval of the US regulatory authority, the Food and Drug Administration.\nMaps' chief scientific officer Dr Berra Yazar-Klosinski said MDMA could be legalised and available for prescription by 2023 in the US, and this summer she plans to travel to Europe to begin the process of seeking regulatory approval from the EU and the UK. \nThe team later plans to explore its potential for other conditions, including depression. \nFollow Rachel on Twitter "

      "text": "Alison Johnstone has been elected as the Scottish Parliament's new presiding officer as MSPs returned to Holyrood after the election. \nMs Johnstone was returned as a Scottish Greens MSP for the Lothians last week. \nBut she will now give up her party affiliation to take over the politically neutral role. \nThe appointment of the new presiding officer was the first task for the parliament's 129 MSPs after they were formally sworn in on Thursday morning. \nMs Johnstone was the only candidate to put themselves forward for the position - and was backed by 97 MSPs, with 28 voting against her, two others abstaining and one spoiling their ballot paper. \nShe has been an MSP since 2011 after previously serving as a councillor in Edinburgh.\nMs Johnstone said she was very proud to become the parliament's sixth presiding officer, describing it as a \"great opportunity and an incredible privilege which I will never take for granted\". \nThe new presiding officer was a talented athlete who held East of Scotland records in the 800m and 1,500m.\nShe has worked at the Scottish Parliament since 1999, initially as a staffer for Green MSP Robin Harper, before taking over his Lothians seat from 2011.\nThe presiding officer role, which is similar to the Speaker in the House of Commons, was filled by Ken Macintosh in the last parliament, but he stood down as a Labour MSP ahead of the election.\nThis is the first time a Green MSP has been elected to the most prestigious job in Scottish politics outside government. \nSome at Holyrood think that's particularly appropriate in the year Glasgow is due to host the COP26 climate summit. \nBut as parliament's impartial referee, Ms Johnstone has to give up her party affiliation - which is why some in the Greens did not want her to stand. \nIn fact, no party in this finely balanced parliament wanted to give up a member to the political neutrality of the chair. \nMs Johnstone was persuaded to become the sole nominee for the \u00a3113,000-a-year job in the absence of any other candidates. \nHer election from the ranks of the opposition means Holyrood is now tied 64 votes to 64 between government and opposition - but the SNP will still need help from other parties to pass budgets and other bills. \nNo party has been keen to give up one of its members to replace him - but Ms Johnstone was persuaded to stand following cross-party talks.\nGiving up one of their MSPS would have left the SNP two seats short of a majority rather than just one.\nMs Johnstone's appointment leaves Holyrood down the middle with 64 SNP MSPs and 64 opposition MSPs. \nBut there is still a pro-independence majority, with a total of 71 SNP and Scottish Greens MSPs.\nLast week's election, which saw the SNP win a landslide victory, means there are 43 new faces among the 129 MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.\nThey include a record number of women, including the parliament's first two women of colour. \nAnd the parliament also has its first permanent wheelchair user to be elected as an MSP, Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy.\nIt is expected that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be formally elected as first minister on Tuesday of next week, and that she will unveil her new ministerial team two days later. \nThursday morning's swearing-in ceremony saw all 129 MSPs take either an oath or affirmation that both include pledging allegiance to the Queen. \nThe oath says: \"I do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God\".\nThe affirmation omits any religious reference, and instead states: \"I do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law.\"\nAs in previous previous years, some members chose to give their oath or affirmation in languages other than English.\nThese included Gaelic, Scots, Doric and Orcadian as well as languages from outside of Scotland - with new SNP MSP Angus Robertson doing his in German, his colleague Humza Yousaf in Urdu, and Scottish Greens MSP Maggie Chapman in Zimbabwean Shona.\nThe new member for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, the SNP's Karen Adam, made her affirmation in sign language.\nMs Sturgeon was sworn in first, as leader of the largest party, followed by the other four party leaders and finally the remaining MSPs.\nScottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said that his allegiance was to the \"people of Scotland\" ahead of making his affirmation."

      "text": "Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot has received a backlash online over her tweet about the escalation of violence in Israel and Gaza. \nThe Israeli actress and former Miss Israel posted: \"Israel deserves to live as a free and safe nation,\" adding: \"Our neighbours deserve the same.\"\nThe comments attracted thousands of replies - now switched off - leading to her name trending on Twitter.\nIn her youth, Gadot completed two years of mandatory military service.\n\"My heart breaks,\" the 36-year-old posted online.\n\"My country is at war. I worry for my family, my friends. I worry for my people. This is a vicious cycle that has been going on for far too long.\n\"I pray for the victims and their families. I pray for this unimaginable hostility to end, I pray for our leaders to find the solution so we could live side by side in peace. I pray for better days.\"\nWhile some high-profile people, including US politician Ted Cruz, praised Gadot for her remarks, many others reacted angrily. \nShe was criticised by supporters of the Palestinian cause, who pointed to her service in the Israeli military. \nIn 2019, Gadot become embroiled in a row with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the status of the country's Arab minority.\n\"Love your neighbour as yourself,\" the Israeli actress said, amid wrangling over the role of Israeli Arab parties in upcoming polls.\nMr Netanyahu caused a stir when he said Israel \"was not a state of all its citizens\", referring to Arabs who made up 20% of its population at the time.\nHe cited a \"nation-state\" law.\nFour years ago, Lebanon banned Wonder Woman from cinemas, because the title character was played by an Israeli actress.\nThe Lebanese interior ministry banned the film hours before its release, on a recommendation from the General Security directorate, reports said.\nThis is not the first time Gadot has come in for criticism for her activity online.\nIn March 2020, she and her celebrity friends - including Will Ferrell, Amy Adams, Kristen Wiig, Sia and Cara Delevingne - rather misjudged the public mood during the first coronavirus lockdown by offering up a collective cover of John Lennon's Imagine. \nThe rich and famous collaborators were mocked mercilessly online by people questioning their choice of song, which imagines a utopia with \"no possessions\".\nAside from Gadot, model Bella Hadid has also offered her thoughts on the situation in the Middle East, via Instagram.\n\"Future generations will look back in disbelief and wonder how we allowed the Palestinian suffering to continue for so long,\" said Hadid, whose father is Palestinian.\n\"A human tragedy unfolding right in front of our eyes.\n\"Politicians stutter neutral words in fear of being reprimanded, whilst the world remains silent to avoid offending the wrong people.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Schools,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Some \u00a313.5bn is needed to reverse the damage to pupils' education caused by the pandemic, a think tank has said.\nThe Education Policy Institute says the money is needed as pupils have lost up to two months of learning in reading, and up to three months in maths. \nIt is calling on the government to extend the school day and increase funding for poor pupils, as part of a series of measures to help recovery.\nThe government has already given \u00a31.7bn for catch-up support in England.\nThis week, the Prime Minister promised to address the learning pupils have missed during the pandemic, and ensure every child is able to fulfil their potential. \nThe report points out this will require significant investment. \nIt says the government will need to put in place an ambitious programme of support to run over a number of years, to help pupils who have lost months of education since schools were first closed in March 2020.\nThe report calculates the total cost to help pupils catch up is \u00a313.5bn over three years, which compares with the annual schools budget for England of \u00a348bn. \nIn total, it is estimated the lost learning could result in total lost lifetime earnings of between \u00a362bn and \u00a3420bn, across the eight million school children in England. \nThe researchers argue that extra support should be kept in place for a number of years to address the inequalities in education that existed before the pandemic, and to improve the results of pupils.\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) research shows that even before Covid, poorer pupils were already 18 months of learning behind their more affluent classmates by the time they took their GCSEs - with that attainment gap already starting to widen.  \nThe impact of school closures meant that by autumn 2020, pupils had lost up to two months in reading overall, and up to three months in maths in primary schools. \nBut following school closures before Christmas and in early 2021, losses are likely to have increased further, the report suggests. \nTo make up for the loss of so much time in school, the report recommends a number of measures that should be part of the recovery plans the government is working on.\nThese include longer school days, so that children can take part in a range of education, sports and social activities.\nOther suggestions include summer activities to help well-being, more one-to-one and small group tuition, extra funding for pupils from poorer families and mental health support.\nThe recovery should also include support for younger children in the early years, where high-quality education and care can play a decisive role. \nAnd much more funding is needed for 16 to 19-year-olds in further education colleges and those studying apprenticeships, the researchers recommend.\nNatalie Perera, chief executive of the EPI, says if the government is committed to dealing with the harmful and long-term consequences of Covid, then it needs to provide a serious funding boost.\n\"We are calling on the government to implement a series of effective, evidence-based policies from this September to support children and young people - not only with their learning, but with their well-being and mental health too.\" \nKevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government's response has been utterly insufficient.\n\"The government must prioritise education in the forthcoming Spending Review so that schools can increase the number of properly qualified teachers on staff, and bring down our historically high class-sizes. The solution to Covid cannot be yet more austerity.\" \nA government spokesman highlighted its initial \u00a31.7bn investment in a catch-up plan for pupils, adding: \"We are working with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to recover from the impact of the pandemic as quickly and comprehensively as possible - and we have appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner to advise on this work.\""
