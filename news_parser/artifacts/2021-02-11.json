      "text": "Highways England should be investigated over possible manslaughter charges after a woman's death on a smart motorway, a coroner has said.\nNargis Begum, 62, from Sheffield, was killed after her car broke down on part of the M1 with no hard shoulder.\nHer own vehicle was hit and ploughed into her, and the length of time it went undetected was highlighted by South Yorkshire coroner Nicola Mundy.\nHighways England said it did not believe it had committed any offence.\nMs Mundy suggested the government-owned company should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider if manslaughter charges were appropriate.\nPrevious hearings into Ms Begum's death in 2018 have heard that 16 minutes elapsed between her Nissan breaking down near Woodall Services and the crash.\nIt took a further six minutes before warning signs were activated.\nMore stories from across Yorkshire\nAt the latest pre-inquest review hearing at Doncaster Coroner's Court, Ms Mundy outlined factors behind her decision to refer the case.\nShe said \"nobody has responsibility for monitoring cameras\" feeding footage from smart motorways and drivers were unaware \"the onus is on them\" to report any incidents.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mrs Begum's daughter, Saima Aktar, said she was pleased the CPS would look into her mum's death and the use of smart motorways.\nShe said it had been \"incredibly difficult\" for the family to come to terms with her mother's death, especially for her father Mohammed Bashir, who had been driving.\nHighways England is a Government-owned company responsible for managing England's motorways and major A-roads.\nNicholas Chapman, representing the firm, said footage from a CCTV camera covering the scene of the crash would have been sent to a \"busy\" regional control centre staffed by \"seven or eight\" people.\nBut he said staff would also be receiving images from about 450 other cameras and there was \"no constant or routine monitoring\".\nHe added that there was no evidence any of the operators did \"anything else other than conscientiously go about their duties\".\nThirty-eight people have been killed on smart motorways across the country in the past five years.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Year-long routine surgery waits 'worst since 2008' in England",
      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly 225,000 people in England have now waited more than 12 months for routine hospital treatment - the highest number since April 2008, NHS England figures show.\nThis includes people waiting for planned knee and hip surgery.\nIt comes as growing numbers of operations were postponed during December when Covid cases rose rapidly.\nIn January 2021 alone, hospitals treated nearly a third of all patients with Covid since the pandemic began.\nProfessor Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said staff had worked extremely hard to provide essential services during the pandemic. \nHe added: \"Even in January, when hospitals admitted almost a third of all the Covid patients they have treated during the pandemic, they were treating twice as many patients with other conditions as they did for those with the virus over the month.\n\"But the NHS remains under significant pressure so it is vital that everyone continues to do all they can to stop the spread of the virus by  staying at home and following the expert 'hands, face, space' guidance.\"\nDespite Covid, NHS England says more than six million elective treatments were completed last year and average waiting times for non-urgent surgery fell by more than 40% between July and the end of the year.\nThe Royal College of Surgeons of England, said Covid-19 continued to take an enormous toll on hundreds of thousands of people across the country left waiting for an operation. \nVice president, Mr Tim Mitchell, said the number waiting over a year for their treatment was now 150 times higher than it had been in 2019.  \n\"Many are waiting in limbo, reliant on painkillers, and unable to get on with day-to-day family life or work,\" he said.\nAlthough infection rates are now coming down in many parts of the country, Mr Mitchell warned many staff were \"burnt-out\" from what had been \"a brutal and traumatic year\" and would need time to recover.\nThe figures suggest cancer services are recovering. \nDuring December, just over 200,000 patients received urgent checks by cancer specialists and 25,000 people started their treatment - both measures are in line with numbers seen before the pandemic.\nBut Sara Bainbridge, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said 2020 had been a \"devastating year\" for many people living with cancer \"who faced agonising delays or disruption to diagnosis and treatment\".\nShe urged anyone experiencing cancer symptoms to contact their GP without delay and go to medical appointments."

      "title": "11 charts on the problems facing the NHS",
      "tags": "NHS",
      "text": " The NHS faces a number of challenges and often tops the list of concerns voiced by the public, but what state is it actually in? \nLast year more than \u00a3156bn was spent on health across the UK - about 12 times the figure that was spent 70 years ago. \nAnd that's after you adjust it for inflation.\nIt means today about 30p out of every \u00a31 spent on public services goes on health.\nEver since the early 1950s the budget has been increasing, but the scale of those rises has varied quite considerably.\nThe average rise has been just over 4%. The biggest rises were seen under the Labour governments between 1997 and 2010 when the average annual rise was about 6%.\nThis dropped to 1% under the post-financial crisis coalition government between 2010 and 2015 - a figure which then rose under the majority Conservative government of recent years.\nThe Conservatives have said their five-year funding plan for the NHS will see the budget rise by an average of 3.4% a year above inflation. It means that by 2023-24 there would be \u00a3149bn of funding available.\nBy comparison, during the 2019 General Election, Labour proposed increasing it by 3.9% - bringing the budget to \u00a3155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems were marginally behind this coming in at \u00a3154bn.\nLabour often talk about the risk of privatisation of the NHS, accusing the Conservatives of wanting to do a deal with US President Donald Trump.\nPrivate firms are already involved in providing NHS care. Just over 7% of the budget goes on private providers, up from just over 5% in 2011-12.\nThese can be deals to run a specific service or to take on some NHS patients for routine treatments like hip and knee replacements.\nBut it still leaves the overwhelming majority of care provided by the state and state-employed staff.\nActually, GPs are technically independent small businesses contracted to provide a service to the NHS - but they tend not to be considered as private providers.\nNHS money also goes to the private sector to purchase drugs and equipment.\nNearly all of this is bought centrally so the NHS can use its bargaining power to negotiate good deals. A recent example of this was the agreement reached with Vertex to fund its cystic fibrosis treatments.\nThe NHS got a significant saving on the price the drug manufacturer originally wanted. Fears have been raised that US firms would want the NHS to agree more lucrative deals - they get more money for their drugs in their own country.  But given the cost to the NHS of such a concession many doubt this is likely.\nThere are three key targets for hospitals: covering A&E, cancer care and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements.\nAll parts of the UK have been struggling to hit them.\nThe way they are measured differs between the UK nations.\nThe A&E target is the most directly comparable - in that each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours.\nPerformance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland than it is in England and Scotland.\nScotland is the last nation to have hit the target - back in the summer of 2017.\nMeanwhile, in cancer care patients are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral. But that too is being missed, while waiting lists for routine treatments are rising.\nIn England it has topped 4.4 million - the highest on record. Some 15% have waited more than the target time of 18 weeks.\nThe ageing population is certainly a major factor for the growing pressures - and it is one with which all health systems in the world are struggling. \nMedical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now.\nThis is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. \nEven cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more.\nBut this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. \nThat level of ill-health means the average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. \nA 90-year-old costs more than seven times as much.\nAs the number of older people continues to rise so will the cost to the NHS. \nThis is compounded by other factors, including the rising cost of new drugs and high levels of obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. \nAll this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy.\nThis is why health has tended to receive more generous rises than other areas of government spending.\nBut despite this the UK has been left trailing some other parts of Europe when it comes to spending as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy.\nIt is a gap that has widened since the previous Labour government was in power from 1997 to 2010.\nThe result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders, which tend to tax people more. \nGermany, for example, has almost twice as many nurses per capita than the UK. \nBut the lack of staff in the NHS is not just because of less spending, the health service cannot even fill the posts for which it has got funding.\nThe NHS in England has nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled at the moment.\nThe total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals.\nIt includes about 40,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies.\nSome of the gaps are filled using overtime and agency staff, but some simply go unfilled.\nThere are various initiatives in place to recruit and retain staff.\nAnd the number of training places for doctors and nurses are increasing.\nWhile the government has been able to put more money into the NHS, one element of the budget that has been cut is the money set aside for capital projects.\nThat covers the cost of infrastructure, such as building works and IT.\nIn recent years that has resulted in a growing maintenance backlog with hospitals having to contend with leaky roofs, out-of-date equipment and crumbling buildings.\nThe capital budget increased by \u00a31bn for 2019-20, bringing the budget up to \u00a37bn.\nThe NHS is also under pressure because of the problems in the social care system.\nSocial care includes day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital.\nThe system is means-tested in England, which means only the poorest receive help from councils towards the cost of care.\nBut even then it is heavily rationed. The result is growing numbers of older people going without care.\nAccording to Age UK, 1.4 million people over the age of 65 are not getting the care they need.\nThat represents one in seven of all older people and is a rise of nearly a fifth in two years.\nThis lack of care in the community has been directly linked to the growing pressures on hospitals by the Care Quality Commission, the body responsible for regulating standards across health and social care.\nThe regulator believes that without reform of the system, the extra money being put into the NHS could be swallowed up without a noticeable improvement in performance.\nThe other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes.\nDespite the challenges being faced by the NHS, the majority of the public say they are satisfied with services.\nThe British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of people in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services in 2018.\nBut levels of satisfaction are falling.\nThe latest score was a three percentage point drop since 2017 and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010.\nExperts say waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low."

      "title": "Brexit: London loses out as Europe's top share trading hub",
      "tags": "Amsterdam,UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "Amsterdam ousted London as the largest financial trading centre in Europe last month as Brexit-related changes to finance rules came into force.\nAbout \u20ac9.2bn (\u00a38.1bn) worth of shares were traded on Amsterdam exchanges each day, against \u20ac8.6bn in London.\nFollowing new Brexit rules, EU-based banks wanting to buy European shares currently cannot trade via London, meaning a loss of fees for City firms.\nBank of England chief Andrew Bailey has warned the EU not to cut off London.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Bailey said there were signs that the EU planned to cut the UK off from its financial markets.\nFollowing the new Brexit trading rules coming into effect, there are talks to harmonise rules over financial regulations - so-called equivalence \nBoth sides are working towards a March deadline to agree an \"equivalence\" regime under which the UK and Europe would recognise the other's regulations.\nNumber 10, said it remained \"open\" to discussions with the EU on the equivalence issue.\n\"Despite the fact that we've supplied all of the necessary paperwork and are one of the world's most preeminent financial centres, with a strong regulatory system, the EU still haven't granted us full equivalence.\"\n\"This has meant that some EU shares that were previously traded on UK venues have moved to the EU venues on advice of the European regulator, but our position is fragmentation of share trading across financial centres is in no one's interest,\" it added.\nIt's called invisible trade - but selling services abroad is something the UK excels in, particularly when it comes to banking. \nFinancial services makes up about 7% of the UK's income in total, and about 40% of banking and investment's business abroad is with the EU.\nBut its needs were largely invisible from the deal struck with the EU at the end of last year. The diversion of share trading is the first visible, if inevitable, sign of the impact. \nAnd that business may not return to London. Even if the UK government and Brussels can ultimately reach agreement that financial services can get more access to each others markets, on the basis the UK's standards can be deemed \"equivalent\" to the EU's, share dealing may not be part of that. \nThe UK government hopes Brexit will enhance the City's dominance, with scope to deepen relationships with other financial centres. But that's a work in progress. \nThe boss of one share exchange described a recently-struck deal that allows Swiss shares to be traded in London as being like a free kick in a football match rather than an equaliser: it doesn't compensate for what has been lost in loosening ties with Europe. \nMr Bailey said the City wanted to reach an agreement on financial rules, but would not accept being \"dictated\" to by Brussels. He said EU demands had so far been unreasonable.\n\"I'm afraid a world in which the EU dictates and determines which rules and standards we have in the UK isn't going to work,\" the governor said in his annual Mansion House speech to the City, this year held virtually. \n\"Is the EU going to cut the UK off from itself? There are signs of an intention to do so at the moment but I think that would be a mistake,\" he added.\n\"We have to state the argument for global standards and markets and openness and if we all sign up to that then there's no need to go in that direction.\"\nFinancial services - a key driver of the UK economy - were largely omitted from the last-minute Brexit trade deal agreed in December. \nThe City generates about \u00a3135bn in business annually, with financial institutions earning big fees from trading stocks and shares. But London's financial centre has been cut off from EU markets since 1 January.\nBut Brussels says it will not be rushed into decisions on granting access for UK financial firms, as it wants to see how far UK rules will diverge from its own.\nIt follows fears the UK will adopt a low-regulation Singapore-style model that would undercut the EU.\nMr Bailey said the EU was holding the UK to unrealistically high standards on the issue of divergence, saying it would in effect make the City a \"rule taker\".\nHe added that while some UK rules would change post-Brexit, sudden deregulation was not on the cards. \n\"Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low-regulation, high-risk, anything-goes financial centre and system,\" he said.\n\"We have an overwhelming body of evidence that such an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else's.\"\nDespite the current situation, Mr Bailey said that London would \"undoubtedly continue as one of the world's leading if not the leading financial centre\".\nLast month Mr Bailey said up to 7,000 finance jobs had so far been relocated from London to rival centres in the EU - well down on predictions of as many as 50,000 losses."

      "tags": "Rhondda,Coronavirus vaccines,Chris Bryant,Leanne Wood,Coronavirus pandemic,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board",
      "text": "The number of vaccines supplied to Wales is expected to fall in the next few weeks, affecting some of the country's vaccination centres.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board says it is pausing vaccinations at four centres for a fortnight. Local politicians say it is because of a fall in the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.\nOther vaccinations centres are expected to reduce their hours.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the drop in supply had been planned for.\nThe Welsh Government said the reduction in supply would affect the whole of the UK.\nIt comes after Wales became the first UK nation on Wednesday to have given first doses to 20% of the population, after a slow start.\nThe government said it was on course to meet its mid-February target of offering a jab to the over 70s, health care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable.\nBut officials are expecting fewer doses of the AstraZeneca jab - which has been mostly delivered in GP surgeries rather than vaccination centres - before deliveries return to recent levels from the beginning of March.\nHealth boards will determine how vaccines are delivered over the next two weeks, with mass vaccination centres changing their opening times to reflect the reduction in supply.\nHealth officials however, say they have sufficient stocks of Pfizer vaccine to significantly increase the number of second doses next week, as those who had a first dose in December are now due for their next injection.\nMr Drakeford told a Welsh Parliament committee: \"We know that we are going to get less vaccine over the next few weeks than we have over the past few weeks.\"\n\"That was planned for and known for and is accommodated in our plans which remain to complete the vaccination of those next five priority groups by the spring. \n\"So, without unforeseen barriers, we are confident that we will remain on track.\"\nHe said plans remain in place to complete vaccinations of the next five priority groups by the spring.\nMr Drakeford said the Welsh NHS \"will be focusing our Pfizer vaccine supply on the second vaccination of those people in the top four priority groups who have already had their first vaccine\".  \n\"We will be deploying the Astra Zeneca vaccine for first shots for people in the next five groups,\" he said.\n\"We will hear, I'm afraid, from people disappointed that the amount of supply they're getting is less than we've had over the last couple of weeks because we could use more. \n\"If there was more, we could use it, there's no doubt about that.\"\nThe vaccination programme will soon be targeting groups further down the priority list - with jabs due to be given to people over the age of 65 and people with underlying health conditions.\nHealth officials say the next two weeks' reduction in supply is planned for - allowing manufacturers to ramp up their production processes, which will lead to significant increases in vaccines from the start of March. \nWales is looking to deliver 103,000 more doses next week - 56,000 Astra-Zeneca vaccines will be mainly first doses and 46,000 Pfizer which will be to push on with second doses for those in the priority groups. \nAnother 108,000 doses would be given out the following week but then numbers would rise to 160,000 to 190,000 and accelerating.\nLast Sunday, Cwm Taf Morgannwg was the best performing of all health boards in giving doses to its 70 to 74-year-olds, according to Public Health Wales figures.\nThe health board's executive director Clare Williams, said the switch to the next phase of vaccination will allow a \"pause\" from 16 February \"for two weeks at our four community vaccination centres in Merthyr Tydfil, Abercynon, Rhondda and Bridgend\".\nVaccination of health and social care workers, and those aged 70-74, is now \"nearly complete,\" she said.\n\"It has always been our intention to bring vaccines as close to where people live as we possibly can.  Therefore, during this two-week pause, we will be looking at the locations of all four of our community vaccination centres (CVCs) to ensure they are in the best locations for residents.\"\nThe board hopes to expand to seven CVCs, with new centres at Aberfan Leisure Centre, Llantrisant Leisure Centre and Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls in Mountain Ash, and Maesteg Leisure Centre.\nPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Transparency is key in maintaining public trust. Everyone involved in the vaccine rollout has done a fantastic job in vaccinating 20% of the Welsh population, but we need to see the flow of vaccines into the four UK nations, to have confidence that we are getting our fair share.\"\nWelsh Conservative MS Angela Burns said:  \"The Conservative UK Government - which is procuring the supplies - is confident that the steady stream of doses will continue, and this underlines the benefit of being in a strong United Kingdom that works for Wales.\"\nHuw Thomas, BBC Wales correspondent\nThe Welsh NHS has planned for reduced supplies over the coming weeks, as have health officials in other parts of the UK.\nAs a result, the news that some vaccine centres will close temporarily is no surprise to the people manning them. \nIt also comes as Wales appears to have reached its milestone of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February.\nNo appointments should be cancelled as a result of the lower doses reaching Wales, and it is not expected to impact the longer-term plan to offer a dose to the top nine priority groups by the spring.\nFrom next week the vaccine statistics will also reflect the increasing numbers of second doses being administered in Wales, as those who were among the first to be vaccinated in the weeks before Christmas are now due to begin receiving their second dose.\nStocks of the Pfizer vaccine will be prioritised for second doses in the coming weeks, ensuring nobody faces a delay in receiving their full immunisation.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We have factored this into our plans and it will not affect people's appointments or delay when people are due to get their second dose.\n\"The supply of vaccines is expected to ramp up significantly from the beginning of March. \n\"Every dose of vaccine we receive will continue to be delivered immediately to all those who need it. Our vaccination teams continue to do an incredible job to vaccinate everyone as quickly as possible.\"\nThe UK government spokesman said: \"We are confident that the steady, regular supply of doses will continue to support the vaccine rollout in the weeks ahead. \n\"If you get called for a vaccine, please continue go to your appointment.\""

Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie.\"\nThe letter said the couple will continue to work with other media and \"young, up-and-coming journalists\" to raise awareness of the issues and causes they care about.\nIn recent days, photographs of the Sussexes delivering food to vulnerable people in Los Angeles have been published by two of the newspapers to receive the letter.\nAnd it comes ahead of a court hearing this week in a legal case Meghan has brought against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter written to the duchess by her estranged father.\nThe couple officially stepped back as senior working members of the Royal Family at the end of March as part of a transition following an announcement of their intention to become financially independent in January..\nAs The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specifically as it pertains to your organisation.\nLike you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracy\u2014 particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account.\nIt has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly. \nIt is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or print\u2014even when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason. When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded.\nThere is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know\u2014as well as complete strangers\u2014have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.\nWith that said, please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see.\nThis policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie. \nThey also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging. And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more diverse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever.\nWhat they won't do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion. \nWe are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected."

Even leaving your own home is only allowed for limited and specific reasons. \nSo whether you'll be heading for a lounger in six months time is, like it or not, part of the government's responsibility.\nAnd the chances of going away will depend, not just on how the disease has shifted at home, but also how other countries have handled it abroad. \nYet still, with progress being made, cases falling, and the government pointing to the start of March as the hoped for beginning of the end of this lockdown, the transport secretary's remarks on Wednesday morning jumped out of the radio. \nGrant Shapps warned that it was too early, not just to book a holiday abroad, but also a holiday at home. \nSources suggest that he was really just exercising natural caution at a very unpredictable time, but by doing so, we entered what has become a very familiar classic Covid situation. \nMr Shapps said don't book anything. But his colleague, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, had previously told the world that he was looking forward to a happy \"Great British Summer\", and had booked his holiday to Cornwall. \nIn turn, the prime minister had earlier said that he was \"optimistic\" about the prospects for summer breaks, even though he added plenty of caveats. \nAt Wednesday's Downing Street press conference, when asked for a second time, Boris Johnson said that it was too early to be sure. \nBut at the same time, Mr Hancock was talking to a group of MPs on a video call. Responding to questions, he repeated his own plans to head to the South West. \nYou would be forgiven for wondering then, as a would be holidaymaker, what you are meant to do?\nOne former minister tried to translate what they meant, suggesting: \"Bottom line on holiday gate: travel abroad this year is unlikely. Holidays within the UK *are* likely by the summer, but the government can't make a hard and fast statement to this effect at this stage.\n\"If you book (as I have), you do so at your own risk.\"\nHaving talked to sources in government about what is likely, that is not a bad guess. But it is, very much, a guess.\nWhich brings us to the second classic Covid situation. \nMinisters' remarks clash with each other - in emphasis or fact sometimes - because they just do not know exactly what the situation will be, so they have no solid decision to explain.\nAnd if they don't know, well there's not much they can tell us. \nThere is a separate conversation about just how vital clarity in government communications is during a public health crisis, whether ministers stick to exactly the same script is a matter that can affect life and death. \nThere are also ways for experienced politicians to not answer questions, even if it makes some people shout at the telly or turn off the radio. \nBut when it comes to looking more than a few weeks into the future, in the way that we all want to, all too often, ministers have ended up in a tangle.\nThat is one of the reasons why the PM, during this lockdown, has been noticeably more cautious about what might come next. \nIt's one of the reasons too why a couple of weeks ago he announced his intention to publish a plan on 22 February.\nIt gives the government a bit of breathing space to work out exactly what it wants to do, rather than ending up in some of the situations they have faced previously that have caused huge frustration - like some boroughs finding out about entering new tiers of regulations with only a few hours to go. \nIn this instance, that plan may not even give detail about holidays, still many months away.\nOn current expectations, schools in England are likely to open their gates to all pupils again on 8 March. \nIf the disease is being squeezed in the way ministers hope by then, it's likely some outdoor sports and some more socialising outside could return too. \nBut it doesn't seem that the next level of reopening, whether getting clients back in the hairdressers' chair, fitness enthusiasts back in the gym or punters back sharing a few drinks in a beer garden, is likely until April onwards. \nAnd underline all of that with heavy black ink - it is dependent on what happens with the disease. \nI've written before that there is a reluctance in government to have to close the doors again. And that conviction seems to be getting stronger, not weaker, with one insider telling me: \"Literally the worst thing we can do is lockdown four.\" \nCaution in No 10 seems to be very firmly bedded in, and with the very real possibility of booster vaccinations being required later in the year, the practical effects of the disease aren't going to disappear fast.  \nThere are massive concerns in the travel industry about losing another summer. Frustration perhaps too among many families eager for a spot of sun, or to know they can go and visit family abroad. \nBut as in many areas of life right now, the government isn't willing, and maybe not really able, to give a guarantee."

      "text": "Nepal has banned two Indian climbers and their team leader for six years from mountaineering in the country after an investigation found they had faked their 2016 climb up Mt Everest.\nNarender Singh Yadav and Seema Rani Goswami's climb was certified by the tourism department at the time.\nThe action against them came when they failed to produce any evidence after Mr Yadav was nominated for an award.\nMr Yadav and Ms Goswami are yet to comment on Wednesday's announcement.\nReaching the top of the 8,848.86m (29,032 ft) mountain is considered to be a shining feat for mountaineers around the globe. \nWhen Mr Yadav was listed for the prestigious Tenzing Norgay Adventure Award last year, the pairs' claims were queried by other climbers.\nA Nepal tourism ministry official told AFP that during their investigations with other climbers, they found that the two \"never reached the summit\" and had failed to produce any reliable pictures of the summit and other evidence.\n\"In our investigation, we found that they had submitted fake documents [including photographs]. Based on the documents and the conversation with the officials concerned, including sherpas [expert Nepalese mountaineers], we reached this conclusion,\" an official from Nepal's tourism and culture ministry told The Indian Express newspaper. \nMr Yadav, Ms Goswami and team leader Naba Kumar Phukon have been placed under a six-year ban - starting retrospectively in 2016. Their Everest summit certification has also been revoked, AFP reported.\nThe tourism ministry has also fined the company that organised the climb and the sherpas that supported them. \nIndians first summited Everest in the 1960s and in 1984, Bachendri Pal became the first Indian woman to climb the mountain. Indians have also set records for \"the first twins\", \"the first female amputee\", \"the youngest girl ever\" and \"the oldest woman ever\" to ascend the peak.\nMany of those who have succeeded in scaling the mountain have subsequently gone on to have lucrative careers as motivational speakers and authors.\nBut this is not the first time Indian climbers have been called out for faking claims that they reached the summit. \nIn 2017, police in the western Indian state of Maharashtra sacked two officers after an inquiry found their claim to be the first Indian couple to climb Everest was fake. \nDinesh and Tarakeshwari Rathod said they had successfully reached the summit in 2016, but Maharashtra police said the couple had \"morphed photographs\" to show a successful ascent. \nNepal's tourism department had initially certified their ascent but rescinded that decision after an investigation."

      "text": "Labour's Stella Creasy is threatening legal action against the government after they did not include all MPs in maternity cover plans.\nThe government has passed a new law so senior ministers do not have to resign if they have a baby.\nThe move was prompted by Attorney General Suella Braverman, who is due to give birth next month.\nMs Creasy, who is also pregnant, welcomed the change, but said it should not just apply to those at the top.\nBackbench MPs are allowed take informal maternity leave, but not all their duties are covered during their absence.\nThe situation is different for ministers, who are not able to take time off from their positions.\nUnder the old system, they had to resign from their ministerial jobs if they want maternity leave, although they continued to receive their MPs' salary.\nBut with the government's changes, Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers are now able to take six months' leave on full ministerial pay, and the salary costs for a temporary replacement will be covered.\nIn 2019, Stella Creasy became the first MP to be given locum maternity leave cover, after a battle with the parliamentary authorities, who, she says, had told her it was not possible under Commons rules.\nThe government's decision to push the Ministerial and Other Maternity Allowances Bill through Parliament in a single day shows that it is possible, the Walthamstow MP said. \nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think every woman should be able to have paid maternity cover, proper cover - it's not just about being paid, it's that somebody else will be doing that job - so Suella Braverman will be able to take proper leave with her child.\"\nMs Creasy, who is expecting her second child, said lawyers had advised her the changes were discriminatory as they only benefitted senior ministers, and not other members of Parliament.\n\"I am very prepared to go to court over this, because it is a form of direct discrimination... as a backbencher, none of these provisions will apply to myself, it's still very unclear what I can tell my constituents they can get in terms of cover,\" she told Today. \n\"Thousands of pregnant women are facing risks in the workplace, including the risk of the loss of their job. The message that we're sending is that we treat maternity leave like a benefit, like a company car.\"\nCabinet Office Minister Penny Mordaunt told MPs the bill to change maternity rights for senior ministers was an \"important and well overdue change\". \nShe said alterations in the Ministerial Code in 2019 allowed for other members of the government to take over roles from a junior minister on maternity leave.\nThe bill puts to an end the \"wholly unacceptable\" situation of senior ministers resigning to allow other government members to take over their departments while on maternity leave, she said in the Commons. \nMs Braverman said she was grateful to Boris Johnson and the Conservatives for \"leading this historic change to support women in the workplace\". \nLabour did not oppose the changes in the Commons.\nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs it had been 20 years since she was the first junior minister - then in the Department of Health - to take maternity leave.\nShe warned the changes were \"limited\" as they did not have any provisions for male ministers to take longer paternity leave.\nMs Cooper said that when she needed to take maternity leave two decades ago: \"I asked the health secretary what I should do, he didn't know, he said ask the prime minister, he didn't know, he said ask the cabinet secretary he said he had no idea.\n\"As ministers are Crown appointments, he said it was really a matter for the Queen, but nobody thought we should be asking Her Majesty.\"\nThe MP said they \"then tried to work something out\" that was similar to the arrangements for civil servants, but \"no one had thought about it before - that was bad enough 20 years ago\".\nShe added: \"At the heart of government [these issues] still aren't being taken seriously enough.\" \nAll MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence:\nLiberal Democrat MP Wendy Chamberlain said for female MPs, there were now provisions for locums to step in, but pointed out that was not yet available for male MPs on paternity leave.\nSome MPs had complaints about the language in the bill - which used the word \"persons\" instead of \"women\" - saying it was \"adopting extreme gender ideology\".\nBut Ms Mordaunt said it had merely been a \"drafting issue\" and the term \"women\" would be used in all its documents going forward."

He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. \nFootage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts \"second floor!\" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. \nAfter Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention on to himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. \nThe image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was  extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said. \n\"Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a Confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,\" he said. \n\"It just reeks of everything we need to correct.\"  \nMr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post.\nHis heroics were noted at the highest level - he was invited to the inauguration as a guest of Vice-President Kamala Harris.\nReporting by Holly Honderich"

      "text": "The World Health Organization recommends using the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca even in countries tackling new variants of coronavirus.\nSome new forms of the virus appear to make vaccines less effective. \nThe WHO also says the vaccine can be used in people aged over 65, which some countries have advised against.\nSpacing out the two doses, as is happening in the UK, makes the vaccine more effective, it advises.\nThe Oxford vaccine is seen as the \"vaccine for the world\" as it is cheap, can be mass produced and is stored in a standard fridge.\nHowever, it has attracted controversy about its effectiveness against new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data.\nThe WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, known as Sage, has been scrutinising evidence from vaccine trials. \nIts interim recommendations say the vaccine is 63% effective overall. \nHowever, early data from trials in South Africa showed the vaccine was offering \"minimal protection\" against mild and moderate disease in young people.\nThe WHO's director of immunisation, Dr Katherine O'Brien, said the South African study was \"inconclusive\" and it was \"plausible\" the vaccine would still prevent severe disease. \nA variant in the country has acquired mutations that seem to help it evade immunity from vaccines and from previous infections.\nHowever Oxford scientists still expect their vaccine to prevent people from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and needing hospital treatment. \n\"There is no reason not to recommend its use even in countries that have circulation of the variant,\" said Dr Alejandro Cravioto, the chairman of WHO's Sage. \nThere has been criticism about a lack of data on the effectiveness of the vaccine in the elderly with some countries, including France and Germany, advising against using it in the over 65s.\nThe WHO said even though there was a small number of over 65s in the trials, other studies showed older people had a nearly identical immune response to younger adults so the vaccine should be used. \nThe scientific advisers also said giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increased the vaccine's effectiveness and provided greater protection.\nInitially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances.\nProf Sarah Gilbert, the chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: \"It is excellent news that the WHO has recommended use of the Sars CoV-2 vaccine first produced in Oxford. \n\"This decision paves the way to more widespread use of the vaccine to protect people against Covid-19 and gain control of the pandemic.\"\nBoris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, said he welcomed the WHO's support for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and for the longer interval between doses.\nIn the UK, more than 13 million people have now received a vaccine to protect against Covid-19. On Wednesday, another 1,001 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus.\nGlobally, there have been more than 2.3 million deaths with the disease during the pandemic"

The BBC is the world's most trusted international news broadcaster and reports on stories from around the world fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\"\nThe commercially funded BBC World News TV channel broadcasts globally in English. In China it is largely restricted and appears only in international hotels and some diplomatic compounds, meaning most Chinese people cannot view it.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the move an \"unacceptable curtailing of media freedom\".  \nThe US State Department condemned the decision, calling it part of a wider campaign to suppress free media in China.\nIn Hong Kong, the publicly-funded broadcaster RTHK said it was suspending the relaying of BBC World Service radio. It had previously aired it daily from 23:00 to 07:00. It also removed a weekly Cantonese programme from the BBC's Chinese Service from its schedule. \nBBC World News TV channel broadcasts, however, are still available in Hong Kong. \nHong Kong, a former British colony, is expected to retain certain rights and freedoms, including freedom of press, until 2047, as part of a handover agreement between China and Britain. \nHong Kong Journalists Association chairman Chris Yeung Kin-hing told the South China Morning Post that RTHK's decision was \"disturbing and worrying\", amid questions about whether RTHK was instructed to act by the authorities.\nThe RTHK union also called the decision \"extremely regrettable\", adding: \"Under the policy of One Country Two Systems, we've never seen Hong Kong being required to follow decisions of China's State Film, TV and Radio Administration before\".\nHong Kong's Office of the Communications Authority said it \"did not set boundaries\" and that decisions were up to individual operators.\nA BBC spokeswoman said: \"We condemn this decision by the Chinese authorities. Access to accurate and impartial news is a fundamental human right and should not be denied to the people of Hong Kong and mainland China, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week.\"\nThe corporation rejected accusations of bias and said it would make every effort to bring the news to its audiences, who would \"still find ways to access the BBC\".\nThe actions in China and Hong Kong follow Ofcom's revoking of the CGTN licence after it found it was wrongfully held by Star China Media Ltd.\nCGTN was also found in breach of British broadcasting regulations last year, for airing the allegedly forced confession of UK citizen Peter Humphrey.\nCGTN can now also no longer be broadcast in Germany following Ofcom's decision, Deutsche Welle reports, as the licence in Germany had been approved by Ofcom as part of a sharing initiative.\nRelations between China and the UK have seen a serious deterioration in recent months over Hong Kong, where Beijing introduced a controversial new security law after a large pro-democracy movement swept the ex-colony.\nIn January the UK introduced a new visa that gives 5.4 million Hong Kong residents the right to live in the UK and eventually become citizens because it believes China is undermining the territory's rights and freedoms.\nAnd in the past two years China has been systematically blocking or banning foreign media, including in effect expelling journalists from three US newspapers in 2020. The BBC website and its app are already banned in mainland China.\nIn February the BBC published a report featuring interviews with Uighur women who said they had been systematically raped, sexually abused and tortured in China's \"re-education\" camps in Xinjiang. China's foreign ministry accused the BBC of making a \"false report\".\nLast month the US said China had committed genocide in its repression of the Uighurs and other mainly Muslim groups.\nAccording to estimates, more than a million Uighurs and other minorities have been detained in camps in China.\nChina denies that Uighurs are persecuted. Last year China's UK ambassador Liu Xiaoming told the BBC's Andrew Marr that reports of concentration camps were \"fake\" and the Uighurs received the same treatment under the law as other ethnic groups in his country."

No timetable has yet been given for the return of other children.\nIn an open letter to headteachers, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the Welsh Government had \"always said\" schools should be \"last to close and first to open\" when safe to do so.\nShe said \"much lower\" rates of transmission of Covid-19 and advice from its Technical Advisory Group had allowed the \"partial and phased return to face-to-face learning in schools\".\nMs Williams explained\u00a0there would be some flexibility to the arrangement over the first week, but with all foundation pupils in school by the end of the week.\nAny further phased return for other year groups will be considered as part of the next 21 day review on 19 February.\nThe Welsh Government has also issued detailed guidance on the return to classes, with teachers told they will be expected to face masks in some circumstances."

      "text": "Larry Flynt, founder of Hustler magazine and self-proclaimed \"smut peddler who cares\", has died aged 78.\nFlynt died in his sleep at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles with family by his side, according to his manager.\nHe frequently courted controversy and was subject to lawsuits during a career spanning five decades.\nFlynt was shot in 1978 while standing outside a courthouse in Georgia during a trial for obscenity.\nThe assassination attempt left him a paraplegic. He had his wheelchair gold-plated and lined with velvet.\nThe man alleged to be the perpetrator was never charged. However he was executed years later, in 2013, in connection with a series of unrelated murders. \nBorn in Kentucky in 1942, Flynt was a school drop-out who began his career in the adult industry by launching strip clubs in Ohio along with his brother.\nA newsletter about those clubs evolved into Hustler magazine, which was first published in 1974. \nAccording to Flynt, at the height of circulation the publication was bought by about three million people a month. \nHis pioneering legal battles were depicted in the 1996 film The People vs Larry Flynt, in which he was played by Woody Harrelson.\nOne lawsuit in particular saw Flynt sued for a sexual parody cartoon of televangelist Jerry Falwell that appeared in Hustler in 1983. \nThe cartoon, a fake advert, showed Mr Falwell saying his first sexual encounter had been with his mother in an outhouse.\nMr Falwell sued Flynt for $50m (\u00a336m) for libel and won in a lower court, but the case went up to the US Supreme Court.\nFlynt then won the case with a unanimous 8-0 verdict, which reinforced free speech rights and protections for satire in the US.\nHis business empire extended into other areas of entertainment and was thought to have a $150m turnover at one point, according to Reuters. \nAway from pornography, he launched and lost long-shot bids at political office and was married five times. \nMinda Gowen, spokeswoman for Larry Flynt Publications, said Wednesday that he died from \"from the recent onset of a sudden illness\".\nHis brother told US media that the death was caused by heart failure.

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' call for people to stop making summer holiday plans has been branded \"puerile and nonsensical\" by a senior travel industry professional.\n\"We're talking about the end of May or June, which is a long way off,\" said Sue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO).\nMr Shapps said there was too much uncertainty because of Covid.\nBut Ms Ockwell said booking breaks gave hope to holidaymakers and the industry.\n\"It's something for people to look forward to and to keep travel companies going,\" she told the BBC.\nEarlier, Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Please don't go ahead and book holidays. I simply don't know the answer to the question of where we'll be up to this summer.\n\"It's too early to give that information. The best advice to people is: do nothing at this stage.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later said it was \"just too early for people to be certain about what we'll be able to do this summer\".\nHe added that he understood \"why people want to make plans now, but we're just going to have to be a little bit more patient\".\nMr Shapps' comments have been seen by many in the travel sector as dealing a blow to hopes of a swift recovery for tourism.\nFor Ms Ockwell, they are symptomatic of a government that has failed to listen to her and her colleagues.\n\"It's highly frustrating. The government doesn't compare notes with anyone in the travel industry,\" she said. \"They could save getting a lot of egg on their faces if they did.\"\nAITO represents about 120 specialist and independent tour operators in the UK. \nMs Ockwell said the industry understood \"the scale of the challenges\" facing the government over coronavirus, but added that tourism brought great benefits to the UK economy and was in need of sector-specific help.\n\"Holidays bring in a lot of money, holidays employ a lot of people and they're good for us,\" she said.\n\"We just want to be allowed to trade. That's all we're asking,\" she added.\n\"We're not forcing people to make bookings. We want people to be allowed to make their own common-sense judgements.\"\nOther travel industry figures have echoed Ms Ockwell's dismay.\nBrian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: \"Airlines are drowning but, rather than throwing us a life raft, the transport secretary has just thrown a bucket of cold water at us.\"\nAnd trade organisation Abta said waiting until the UK's vaccination programme was completed before allowing people to travel abroad meant \"we'll lose another summer season to the pandemic\".\nSeveral big travel companies, including Tui and Ryanair, have said they expect to see a strong rebound in bookings this summer.\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC he remained \"optimistic\" that British people would be allowed to travel from May onwards.\n\"Many companies will not see their way through next winter if we go through a second summer of no bookings,\" he added."

      "text": "The average house price in Wales has gone over \u00a3200,000 for the first time, the country's biggest building society has said.\nThe Principality said lockdown had encouraged a \"race for space\" with people buying larger properties with bigger gardens. \nEighteen of the 22 council areas in Wales saw record prices in the last three months of 2020.\nBut sales were down 21% over that period compared with the previous year.\nAll council areas saw an increase in prices from 2019.\nThe average price for a home in Wales is \u00a3209,723.\nThe Principality's House Price Index does not take account of inflation over years so this is the \"nominal value\" rather than the \"real value\".\nTaking account of inflation, Wales was 7% below the record high from September 2007 but is the highest since July 2008 in real terms.\nPrices rose by 8.2% in 2020, the highest rate of increase in 15 years.\nBut there are concerns that some people might find themselves unable to get on to the property ladder due to rising prices.\nNot all property types are increasing equally, with demand for detached houses higher than other homes and the price of flats \"languishing since April 2020\".\nThe Principality index is based on sales figures from HM Land Registry. \nThere were double digit increases in annual prices in Anglesey (16%), Conwy (14%), Monmouthshire (14%), Flintshire (13%) and Newport (12%).\nBridgend, Ceredigion, Gwynedd and the Vale of Glamorgan were the only council areas that hadn't experienced peak prices but had still seen an increase from 2019.\nThe Welsh Government removed land transaction tax from all property sales below \u00a3250,000 from July 2020 to March 2021, saving buyers almost \u00a32,500 in tax per sale.\nElfed Wyn Jones returned to live at his family's farm near Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, last year after losing his job in Aberystwyth due to the pandemic.\nHe and his girlfriend, Anwen Duncan, would like to buy their own family home nearby with at least two bedrooms and they could afford a mortgage of up to \u00a3110,000, but he often sees places selling for in excess of \u00a3200,000.\n\"When the rare opportunity comes up with something in our price range, it gets sold quite quickly,\" he said.\nHe suggested a cap on the number of holiday lets in areas to stop them from \"driving up prices\".\n\"I know of about seven or eight of the couples in Trawsfynydd who'd love to buy a house and start a family but, again, the houses that are in their price range and my price range tend to sell like hot cakes,\" he said.\n\"It's quite heart-breaking really.\"\nNorth Wales estate agent Dafydd Hardy said business had been \"good\" over the last year which he had not expected due to the pandemic.\nHe said buyers have been looking to \"change lifestyle\" such as up-sizing.\n\"They've focused on their needs really, and that's what has created the market,\" he added.\nHe said the current lockdown measures had hit the market, with house sales down about 40% locally compared to last year.\n\"But we are expecting that the market will take off again.\"\nTom Denman, chief financial officer at Principality Building Society, said: \"The strength of the housing recovery in the second half of 2020 is striking, and this reflects both the stimulus provided by the Welsh Government in terms of the time-limited land transaction tax holiday, the pent-up demand which built up during the first lockdown, and the race for space to buy bigger properties with larger gardens.\n\"This increased demand has been driven by increased savings in many households during the lockdowns coupled with continued historic low mortgage rates. \n\"There has probably been some additional demand from buyers across the border with England, with house prices more affordable in Wales in relative terms,\" he added.\nHouse prices across the UK rose by 6.5% last year, according to Nationwide.\nBut the Halifax suggested there had been a drop in prices UK-wide between December and January.\n\"On a range of metrics - buyer inquiries, instructions to sell, agreed sales, activity per surveyor and sales to stock ratio, Wales was equal to, or outperformed, the most active of English regions,\" the House Price Index concluded.

      "text": "It is \"too early\" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead, the health secretary has said.\nMatt Hancock said there was still \"a lot of uncertainty\" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year.\nHe told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall \"months ago\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to \"get rid of the mixed messages\" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year.\nSome Tory MPs and businesses also criticised the government for fuelling uncertainty for travel companies already struggling in the pandemic.\nIt follows confusion after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned \"people shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally\".\nDowning Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February.\nAnalysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake\nFor most announcements from the government, a day here or there might not make much difference. \nBut nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised \"roadmap\" to take England out of lockdown. \nSo when the prime minister promised that \"on 22 February\" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. \nBut now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come \"on the week of the 22nd\" - which isn't quite the same. \nIn response, Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to \"backslide\" on its promise. \nThey want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. \nA vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. \nOthers have been more patient and kept faith the government will take the right decisions at the right time. \nBut the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. \nMr Hancock told BBC Breakfast it was too early to know which coronavirus restrictions may still be in place over the summer, but that he understood people wanted to make plans.\n\"People are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday\", he said, but \"pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty\".\n\"We are doing everything that we possibly can to make sure that people can have a holiday this summer but the vaccine rollout is absolutely essential to that,\" he continued.\nThe health secretary also said that, before summer holidays, the priority would be making sure people can see loved ones again - but it was too early to say when this might happen.\nThe latest government figures show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 from Wednesday.\nThe UK also reported another 678 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, along with a further 13,494 new daily cases.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still \"incredibly high\". \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it \"doesn't make any sense\" to set out plans to ease restrictions with arbitrary dates in March or April, adding that \"the data has to drive us\".\n\"In 2020 we lifted restrictions too quickly... as a result the transmission went back up in this country,\" he said.\nDawn Dillon, from Surrey, says her husband booked a holiday to Spain in June 2019 for the following year as her birthday present.\nThey were able to move the trip, which cost \u00a31,000 for accommodation and flights, from 2020 to June 2021.\n\"But what do we do now - will we lose our holiday?\" she asks. \n\"I know it's not a priority but it would be nice to have some clarity.\"\nDawn, who is 55 and asthmatic, says she had anticipated that she would have had a Covid vaccine, along with her husband, before the trip in June.\n\"But you don't know how advanced the vaccination process is in other countries,\" she adds.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that as far as holidays were concerned, people would have to be a \"little bit more patient\".\nThe PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson does not have a holiday planned but \"is obviously keen to have a break over the summer\".\nBut Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised ministers for not being clearer about what the public could plan for.\nHe said he had yet to book a holiday because he was \"in the same boat as everyone else\".\nSir Keir said he had a \"holding\" booking for a break in Devon in August that is \"subject to restrictions, that's the best anybody can do\".\nSenior Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker accused ministers of \"ripping out\" the goalposts on the timetable for lifting Covid restrictions.\nPeople \"need to have something to look forward to\", he said.\nOne travel industry leader criticised the government's plea for people to stop making summer plans as \"puerile and nonsensical\".\nAnd Heathrow Airport's chief executive said getting back to normality was not just about people's holidays but also to \"protect people's businesses and livelihood\".\nMeanwhile, Henry Joce, of Tencreek Holiday Park and Campsite in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5 Live it may be too late, not too soon, to book a spot there over certain dates this summer. \nHe said soaring demand for breaks over the past fortnight meant he was at risk of selling out during peak weeks, which he put down to people \"being desperate to get away\".\nUnder the current national restrictions, holidays are not permitted anywhere in the UK. International travel is restricted to essential purposes, such as for work, medical appointments, or education.\nA new online portal allowing UK and Irish nationals and residents travelling from certain \"red list\" countries to book a place in hotel quarantine had technical issues as it launched on Thursday.\nFrom Monday, arrivals from 33 nations deemed high-risk due to new virus variants must isolate for 10 days in managed facilities at a cost of at least \u00a31,750. \nAll other arrivals must see out a 10-day quarantine at home, but will be required to pay \u00a3210 for two additional private virus tests booked prior to arrival.\nHave you planned a holiday for this year? Are you returning to the UK soon and will be staying at a quarantine hotel? Please share your experiences."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Arthritis,Nursing,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe number of people waiting more than 12 months to start hospital treatment in England was 224,205 in December, NHS figures show. It's the highest for any calendar month since April 2008, and compares with 1,467 in December 2019. It comes as growing numbers of operations were postponed during December when Covid cases rose rapidly. Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said the health service \"remains under significant pressure\" and staff had worked extremely hard to provide essential services during the pandemic.\nA drug normally used to treat arthritis can be a life-saver for some of the sickest hospital patients with Covid, according to new research. For every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, along with a cheap steroid already routinely given, an additional life would be saved, experts have said. Some hospitals are now doing this. As well as improving survival and recovery time, it can avoid patients needing to be moved to intensive care, said NHS doctors. A clinical trial with more than 4,000 volunteers was carried out and researchers say the results are a \"tremendous step forwards\".\nMore than one million people have had their first dose of the Covid jab in Scotland so far. But Nicola Sturgeon has warned that the country's vaccination programme is likely to slow down later this month because of supply problems. The first minister said a \"temporary reduction\" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected. This means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced. But Ms Sturgeon insisted Scotland is still on track to hit its targets.\nIt wasn't a great start for travellers wanting to book their rooms in hotels being used as part of the UK's quarantine scheme. The new system for securing a place was taken offline minutes after it launched. The portal, set up as part of efforts to control new Covid variants entering the UK, was removed temporarily for maintenance \"to correct a minor technical error\". It said rooms were available \"and travellers will be able to book through the site imminently\". From Monday, British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from 33 \"red-list\" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, at a cost of \u00a31,750 for one adult.\nA mother and daughter have joined nursing courses at the same university after they both decided they wanted to help on the front line as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was \"nice to have someone who understands\" when she comes home after a day of lessons.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page, including our detailed look into how the pandemic has impacted the nation's mental health.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Nearly six out of every 10 people who died with coronavirus in England last year were disabled, figures suggest.\nSome 30,296 of the 50,888 deaths between January and November were people with a disability, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows.\nIt also suggests the risk of death is three times greater for more severely disabled people.\nCharities have called for urgent government action, describing the data as \"horrifying and tragic\". \nThe ONS figures suggest disabled people were disproportionately affected by the pandemic - accounting for 17.2% of the study population but nearly 60% of coronavirus deaths.\nAmong women, the risk of death involving coronavirus was 3.5 times greater for more-disabled women - defined as having their day-to-day activities \"limited a lot\" by their health - compared with non-disabled women.\nFor less-disabled women, defined as having their day-to-day activities \"limited a little\", the risk was two times greater.\nCompared to non-disabled men, the data showed that the risk was 3.1 times greater for more-disabled men, and 1.9 times greater for less-disabled men.\nLooking at people with a medically diagnosed learning disability, the risk of death involving Covid was 3.7 times greater for both men and women compared with people who did not have a learning disability.\nThe ONS said an \"important part\" of the increased risk was because disabled people were \"disproportionately exposed to a range of generally disadvantageous circumstances\" compared with non-disabled people.\nJames Taylor, from disability equality charity Scope, said disabled people had been \"hardest hit\" by the pandemic and there was \"an urgent need for the government to act\".\n\"Behind these horrifying and tragic figures are individual stories of disabled people whose lives have been cruelly cut short by coronavirus.\"\nRichard Kramer, chief executive of national disability charity Sense, said that throughout the pandemic disabled people had \"largely been forgotten, left without sufficient support, information and communication\".\n\"The government must act now, planning its way out of lockdown with disabled people and their family's needs prioritised, to show that it's learnt from the mistakes of the past year.\""

      "title": "New coronavirus variant: What do we know?",
      "tags": "Medical research,Vaccination,James Gallagher,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban.\nSo how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months?\nThe government's advisers on new infections now say they have \"high\" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants. \nAll the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions. \nAs I've written before, viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focus on whether the virus' behaviour is changing. \nThree things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention:\nAll of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. \nHowever, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently. \nBut already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant.\n\"Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,\" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me.\nIt was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. \nYou can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory.\nMathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have. \nBut teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard.\nThe figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4. \nThat 70% number appeared in a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London, on Friday. \nDuring the talk he said: \"It is really too early to tell\u2026 but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this.\"\nThere is no \"nailed on\" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%. \nBut there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all. \n\"The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,\" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. \nIt is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations.\nThe variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off.  \nData from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases.\nA similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one.\nYes.\nThe virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world. \nThe D614G mutation emerged in Europe in February and became the globally dominant form of the virus. \nAnother, called A222V, spread across Europe and was linked to people's summer holidays in Spain.\nAn initial analysis of the new variant has been published and identifies 17 potentially important alterations. \nThere have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells. \nOne mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the \"receptor-binding domain\".\nThis is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. \n\"It looks and smells like an important adaptation,\" said Prof Loman.\nThe other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink.\nWork by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments. \nStudies by the same group suggest the deletion makes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus. \nProf Gupta told me: \"It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried.\"\nThe variant is unusually highly mutated.\nThe most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus.\nInstead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored.\nHowever, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. \nIf the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment.\nAlmost certainly yes, or at least for now. \nAll three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up.\nVaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work.\n\"But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,\" said Prof Gupta.\n\"This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that.\"\nVaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people.\nThis may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus.\nThis variant is just the latest to show the virus is continuing to adapt as it infects more and more of us. \nA presentation by Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow on Friday, concluded: \"The virus will probably be able to generate vaccine escape mutants.\"\nThat would put us in a position similar to flu, where the vaccines need to be regularly updated. Fortunately the vaccines we have are very easy to tweak.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "UK air pollution,Air pollution",
      "text": "About six million people aged over 65 in England are at high risk of lung damage and asthma attacks because of toxic air, according to a new report. \nIt finds that older people and those with lung disease who are most vulnerable to the effects of pollution are often the most exposed. \nThe new document is from the British Lung Foundation (BLF) and Asthma UK. \nIt comes as MPs also demand the government sets tougher targets for air pollution.\nImproving air quality needs to be \"at the core\" of the UK's post-pandemic rebuild, say members of a House of Commons committee that focuses on environmental issues.\nThe new report by two of the UK's leading respiratory charities finds that a quarter of all care homes and a third of all GP practices and hospitals in England are in places where particulate pollution exceeds the limits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), according to the new report.\nThe focus is on exposure to fine particulate matter.\nThis consists of tiny particles known as PM2.5s which have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres across - that is one-four-hundredth of a millimetre, or about 3% of the diameter of a human hair.\nPM2.5 particles are so small they can lodge in the lungs and even pass into the bloodstream. There's evidence they can damage blood vessels and other organs. \nParticulate pollution affects us all, but older people are more likely to suffer lung disease or have weakened lungs from aging.\nThere are no safe limits for PM2.5s, but the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that concentrations should not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic metre. \nThe BLF and Asthma UK report used data on PM2.5s collected in 2019. They found air pollution blackspots across the country that affected care homes. \nIn 36 local authorities, every single care home is located in areas with PM2.5 levels above the limits recommended by the WHO. These include Epping Forrest, Luton, Thurrock, Reading, Slough, Spelthorne, Broxbourne, Dartford and Watford.\nAir pollution is a major health issue in the UK, says Dr Nick Hopkinson, the medical director of the BLF.\nHe estimates that between 30,000 and 40,000 premature deaths each year are caused by exposure to toxic air. \nAir pollution also increases the chances of a person developing lung cancer and cardiovascular disease and may be associated with cognitive decline, including dementia.\n\"We know that older people are more likely to be exposed to particulates and we know that air quality is worse where poor people live\", Dr Hopkinson told BBC News.\nIt also found that 3,000 hospitals and GP practices are in areas where particulate pollution exceeds WHO recommended levels.\nThe current legal limit for PM2.5 in the UK is twice the WHO recommendation, at 20 micrograms per cubic metre.\nThe BLF and Asthma UK are demanding the government reduce that to the 10 micrograms per cubic metres limit recommended by the WHO.\nThe advice has been echoed by the Commons environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee.\nThe charities behind the report are also calling for the government to appoint a minister with specific responsibility for improving air quality in the UK and to publish a national health protection plan to safeguard those most at risk from toxic air. \nKimberlee Cole from Eastbourne is one of those people. \nShe has a lung condition called bronchiectasis, which is exacerbated by air pollution. \nHer lungs are so sensitive she can tell how polluted it is just by breathing in the air when she opens the door in the morning.\nWhen the particulate count is high, it irritates her lungs, making them produce excess mucus which leads to violent coughing fits that can last hours.\n\"Sometimes my lungs actually bleed\", Kim says. \"Sometimes it can be so bad I'm actually sick because of the coughing.\"\nResponding to the report, Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: \"Air pollution has reduced significantly since 2010 with emissions of fine particulate matter falling by 9% and emissions of nitrogen oxides are at their lowest level since records began. However, we know there is more to do.\n\"Our landmark Environment Bill will set at least two ambitious legally-binding air quality targets, with a primary focus on reducing exposure to particulate matter pollution. As part of this, we will consider the World Health Organization's guidelines for PM2.5.\n\"PHE (Public Health England) also continues to support health professionals improve our understanding of links between air pollution and health, including working with the National Institute for Care Excellence to develop guidelines and standards to better protect vulnerable people from air pollution.\" \nAlastair Lewis, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York, welcomed the report's focus on the impact of air pollution on vulnerable communities.\n\"The largest inequalities arise based on issues like health and deprivation and deprived communities typically have the worst air quality,\" he says.\nHowever, he cautions that the figures for particulate pollution in the report are based on atmospheric models, rather than measurements made on the ground.\nHe also points out that much of the PM2.5 in the atmosphere is often formed in the atmosphere by chemical reactions of other gases. \nThese gases move between regions and even between countries so there may not be a local solution to the problem. \nDr Heather Walton, an expert in air pollution from Imperial College London, also welcomed the findings. She told BBC News: \"The summary of the health evidence is well balanced and the modelling used is a standard model used by Defra.\"\nShe said the WHO guidelines provided a useful focus, but added: \"Nonetheless, it is important to note that health effects continue down to concentrations below the WHO guidelines and so it is always beneficial to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in whatever way possible.\"\nFollow Justin on Twitter."

      "tags": "Scotland Brexit,Coronavirus lockdown measures,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Hospitality industry,UK economy,Economic effects of Brexit,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic,Trade",
      "text": "Scotland's food and drink industry is warning of price rises and potential shortages when new Brexit rules on imports come into force in April.\nThe UK's departure from the European Union has already led to a forest of new paperwork for firms exporting to the continent.\nAccording to James Withers, of trade body Scotland Food and Drink, the impact has been \"horrendous\".\nHe says the seafood sector alone was losing \"about a million pounds a day\".\n\"There's no sign of any improvement soon,\" Mr Withers says. \"In fact [there are] many signs things could get worse.\"\nThe UK government said it was working closely with businesses to make sure they could \"take advantage of the opportunities\" that leaving the European Union brings.\nIt said businesses were adjusting well to the new trade rules, which are being phased in over the next few months, and it was offering extensive advice and support. \nWhen Great Britain finally left the single market on Hogmanay the EU insisted on the immediate introduction of controls on exports to the continent but the UK government opted to wait until 1 April to introduce similar checks on imports.\nMr Withers says: \"Those checks, when they're put in place, could also make things slow, more expensive and a lot more complex for EU businesses who need to sell products into businesses here. \n\"And that's a big issue for supermarkets and will be a big issue for many food companies who get ingredients from Europe.\"\nOne of those companies is Charles Stamper Fruit and Veg in Edinburgh which sources much of its produce from Spain and the Netherlands.\nManaging director Louise Stamper says: \"One thing for certain is prices will go up. \n\"It's going to just become very expensive to go out for a meal.\"\nMs Stamper founded the firm 32 years ago with her husband, Charles. They normally supply fresh fruit, vegetables and other produce to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes.\nLike many businesses they saw a heavy impact last year due to the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns.\nMs Stamper says the first lockdown in March last year saw them lose all but a handful of their customers.\nSwitching to home deliveries helped but they didn't come close to making up for the lost trade. A year ago the firm employed 30 people. Now it has 15 staff.\nMaking matters worse, Ms Stamper says imports are 20% more expensive than they were last winter, a rise which she attributes in part to Brexit-related border disruption.\nMr Withers reckons that the enforced closure of hospitality, entertainment and tourism due to Covid cost food and drink firms \u00a33bn in lost sales in 2020, in a sector worth \u00a315bn annually to the country's economy, including \u00a36bn of exports.\nJim Cummiskey, chief executive of food wholesaler Failte Group, says the impact of the pandemic has been massive.\n\"To sum up the hospitality industry in one word: horrendous,\" he says.\nThe Glasgow giant is based beside a huge food market at Blochairn in the north of the city and has three arms: produce, food service and wholesale.\n\"We've paid off probably 17 staff,\" says Mr Cummiskey, glancing around at empty shelves in a vast refrigerated warehouse which he says would usually be crammed with fresh produce.\n\"People just seem to think you can switch the lights back on and everything's going to be back to normal. That's not going to happen in this industry. It's going to take years of recovery,\" he says.\nCompared to the effects of the pandemic Mr Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation.\nBad weather rather than Brexit is to blame for seasonal price rises on continental goods, he argues.\n\"The UK will diversify,\" insists Mr Cummiskey. \"We always have and we always will. So we'll store more Scottish product when it's in season and we'll store more UK product when it's in season.\"\nSome businesses which export to the EU are not so relaxed.\nWilma Finlay and her husband David run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway, famous for its ice cream and visitor centre.\nWhen the nation was ordered to stay at home in March last year, and again this winter, tourism and ice cream sales to restaurants collapsed.\nThe impact on turnover was \"massive\" says Ms Finlay, \"absolutely massive\".\nLuckily the farm had recently branched out into the production of cheese with the creation of a company called The Ethical Dairy.\n\"Home delivery has just taken off,\" she explains.\n\"It went from 30 orders a week to 300 orders a week almost overnight.\"\nThat's nothing like enough to offset the farm's ice cream and tourism losses but if Scotland were still in the EU, says Ms Finlay, she would now be taking the cheese enterprise to the next stage by ramping up exports to the continent.\nThe additional costs of Brexit have put paid to that ambition. They amount, she calculates, to \u00a345 in time and paperwork on every \u00a335 order. That's before she has even considered the cost of production or postage.\n\"It's just a non-starter,\" says Ms Finlay who describes the impact of Brexit as an \"annoyance\" and the pandemic as \"devastating\".\nWhat really surprised the Finlays though was the realisation that the EU-mandated checks and paperwork would also apply to trade with Northern Ireland where they had developed a number of loyal customers.\nThe reason lies in the deal formalising the UK's exit from the EU which allowed Northern Ireland to remain in the single market to prevent the potentially incendiary return of an Irish land border.\nInstead there is now an Irish Sea border: dividing the UK, outraging unionists and leading to shortages of some goods in Northern Ireland.\n\"We hadn't seen that [Brexit] would also close the route to Northern Ireland because we're actually physically nearer to Belfast than we are to Glasgow and Edinburgh,\" says Ms Finlay who says she was deeply disappointed to be forced to stop supplying her Northern Irish customers.\nThe disruption of commerce is also have an effect on the constitutional debate.\nIn the 2016 referendum Brexit was supported by majorities of voters in England and Wales - and therefore by the UK overall - but it was opposed by 62% of people who cast ballots in Scotland and 56% in Northern Ireland.\nSince then support for Scottish independence has risen, with more than 20 polls in a row indicating a majority in favour of Scotland going it alone, and there has also been renewed discussion about the possibility of a referendum - known as a border poll - on Irish reunification.\nFor now though a more pressing concern for business is the effect of the new checks and charges on imports from the EU to Britain due to come into effect on 1 April and whether they will lead to the shortages in Northern Ireland being replicated elsewhere in the UK?\nMr Withers of Scotland Food and Drink is concerned.\n\"At the moment supply chains are pretty robust,\" he says. \"The big supermarkets know what they are doing but if the lessons of the first few weeks in trying to get products out of the country are replicated for products coming into the country, we could find a real challenge.\"\nFresh fruit and vegetables are particularly vulnerable, he warns, especially when they are out of season in Scotland.\nHe says: \"What I do know is we sell \u00a31.2bn of Scottish food into the European Union every year and that has got an awful lot more difficult, an awful lot more expensive and an awful lot slower.\""

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex's father, Thomas Markle, will testify if asked to in the court case against Meghan, the duchess' half sister has said.\nSamantha Markle - Mr Markle's daughter from his first marriage - told the BBC: \"If he is called, he will come.\"\nNew court documents in the case between Meghan and the Mail on Sunday show the paper will use evidence from Mr Markle. \nNo date has been set for a hearing in the case, which centres on a private letter Meghan wrote to him.\nMeghan accuses the paper of misusing her private information, breaching copyright and selective editing.\nThe Mail on Sunday rejects the claims and says there was \"huge and legitimate\" public interest in publishing the note.\nDocuments submitted to the High Court by the paper laying out its defence show much of the evidence it could rely upon comes from Mr Markle.\nHe was at the centre of controversy in the lead up to Meghan's marriage to Prince Harry in May 2018.\nThe documents include text messages sent from Mr Markle to his daughter before the wedding.\n\"The fact that so much of the evidence appears to come directly from him and that he appears to be co-operating with the paper presents at least the possibility of him being called to testify in court against his own daughter,\" BBC reporter John Donnison said.\nThe Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday's sister paper, reported on Wednesday that Mr Markle was \"expected to be called as a key witness\" in the case.\nThe newspaper has given what BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond describes as a \"very robust\" response to Meghan's claims.\nThe paper argues in legal documents that members of the Royal Family, including the duchess, \"rely on publicity about themselves and their lives in order to maintain the privileged positions they hold and promote themselves\".\nIt said the duchess \"did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that the contents of the letter were private and would remain so\".\n\"There is a huge and legitimate public interest in the Royal Family and the activities, conduct and standards of behaviour of its members,\" it said.\n\"This extends not merely to their public conduct, but to their personal and family relationships because those are integral to the proper functioning of the monarchy.\"\nAs evidence that it did not infringe her privacy, the paper says the letter was \"immaculately copied\" in Meghan's \"elaborate handwriting\", arguing that this care in its presentation meant she anticipated it would be seen and read by a wider audience.\nThe 44-page legal filing by the Mail on Sunday aims to tackle the duchess' claims one by one:\nIn October, law firm Schillings, acting for the duchess, filed a High Court claim against the Mail on Sunday and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018.\nAt the time, Harry said he and his wife were forced to take action against \"relentless propaganda\".\nReferring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, he said: \"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\nThe legal proceedings are being funded privately by the couple and any proceeds will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\nMr Markle was invited to the royal couple's 2018 wedding but had to pull out because he needed heart surgery. \nIn the run up to the big day, he became embroiled in a controversy over reports he had staged paparazzi photos of himself in wedding-related activities, such as being measured for a new suit. \nIn December that year, he told ITV he had not spoken to his daughter since she married Harry. \nThe documents submitted by the Mail on Sunday say a text message days before the wedding signed \"Love M and H\" admonished Mr Markle for talking to the press. And that he replied: \"...I'm sorry my heart attack [is an] inconvenience for you.\"\nMeghan returned to Canada to be with her son Archie last week.\nThe duchess visited a women's centre in Vancouver on Tuesday, in her first public appearance since she and Prince Harry said they would \"step back\" as full-time royals.\nThe Downtown Eastside Women's Centre posted a photograph of the duchess with staff and visitors on Facebook, with the caption \"Look who we had tea with today\". Her visit was \"to discuss issues affecting women in the community\", the group added.\nThe visit provides a sense of what the family's future may be like in Canada, following their decision to split their time between the Commonwealth country and the UK.\nPrince Harry is expected to join Meghan and Archie in Canada at a later date - he is due to attend an official event at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.\nHe has been posting on the couple's Instagram page - announcing that venue for the 2022 Invictus Games - the sporting event he founded for injured service personnel and veterans, which will be held in Dusseldorf, Germany.\nMeanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have made their first joint engagement since Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to \"step back\".\nWilliam and Kate were greeted by cheers from several hundred well-wishers on Centenary Square, Bradford, on a visit to the 19th-century City Hall.\nDetails of the Mail on Sunday's defence come as the Royal Family seeks to redefine the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's role after the pair issued their surprise statement a week ago.\nThe Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry met at Sandringham on Monday to discuss the couple's future.\nIn a statement released later, the Queen said discussions had been \"very constructive\" and that final decisions will \"be reached in the coming days\".\nYes - it is not the first time the royals have taken legal action against the press. \nIn 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were awarded \u00a392,000 (100,000 euros) in damages after French magazine Closer printed topless pictures of the duchess in 2012."

      "text": "Scotland's vaccination programme is likely to slow down later this month because of supply problems, the first minister has warned. \nNicola Sturgeon said a \"temporary reduction\" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected.\nThis means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said Scotland is still on track to hit its vaccine targets.\nAnd she said the country would be able to \"rapidly accelerate\" the vaccination programme again if supplies increase again. \nA further 63,178 people had their first dose of the vaccine on Wednesday - the highest in a single day so far despite the bad weather - bringing the total in Scotland to 1,048,747.\nThe figure for the UK as a whole stands at more than 13 million. \nNearly a quarter (23%) of all adults in Scotland have had their first dose, including about 97% of over 80-year-olds, 87% of those aged between 75 and 79 and 54% of 70 to 74-year-olds. \nMs Sturgeon said the figures meant that Scotland had given the first dose to 75,000 more people than than had originally been expected by this stage. \nAnd she said it gave \"real hope\" that the vaccine will soon start to have an impact on the number of people dying or becoming seriously ill with the virus. \nBut she said the higher than expected take-up, alongside reduced supplies of the Pfizer jab and the need to preserve some stocks for second doses, meant that \"we may need to reduce the number of appointments that we schedule over the next few weeks\".\nThe first minister added: \"This sort of issue is not unexpected, given the huge complexities that the vaccination programme throws up. \n\"Importantly, we remain on course to meet the key targets we have set out. \n\"And we still anticipate, subject to supply, that everyone over the age of 50 will have received their first dose by early May.\"\nIt was revealed last month that the UK was set to face short-term delays in delivery of the Pfizer jab as the pharmaceutical company upgraded its production capacity.\nPfizer is upscaling production at its plant in Puurs, Belgium, in efforts to produce more doses than originally planned for 2021 - temporarily reducing deliveries to all European countries.\nThe American firm said at the time that this would mean \"fewer doses will be available for European countries at the end of January and the beginning of February.\"\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nScotland's health secretary, Jeane Freeman, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme earlier on Thursday that the issue was \"about the supply into the UK, it is not about distribution around the UK\" and would therefore affect all four nations of the UK.\nShe added: \"That will reduce our expected supply next week and the week after by about somewhere between 120,000 and 190,000 doses a week overall over the two vaccines.\"\nBut the UK government said it was \"confident of our vaccine supply\" and that it would be able to hit its target of vaccinating everyone in the top four priority groups by next Monday. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"We are confident of supplies but we haven't commented on details of delivery schedules or movements of the vaccines.\" \nAnd a spokeswoman from Northern Ireland's Department of Health said: \"We are not aware of any Pfizer supply issues and are continuing to work through the priority groups as planned.\"\nMeanwhile, the deaths of a further 48 people in Scotland who had previously tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total by that measure to 6,599.\nHowever, only 4% of the tests carried out on Wednesday returned positive results - down from 4.8% the previous day.\nThe R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is transmitted - continues to be below one. \nAnd the number of people in hospital wards with the virus has now fallen slightly below the peak from the first wave last year, with the number of patients in ICU units also gradually falling."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Omicron variant,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "tags": "Rail travel,Birmingham,HS2,Manchester,Crewe,Environment,Leeds",
      "text": "The go-ahead for the next phase of Britain\u2019s controversial HS2 high-speed rail network has been approved.\nPhase 2A of the project will be built from the West Midlands to Crewe, and was given Royal Assent on Thursday.\nSupporters of HS2 say it will spur economic growth, help level up the country, and provide greener transport.\nBut environmentalists say it will increase carbon emissions and can\u2019t be justified now people have embraced video conferencing such as Zoom. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"Whatever your view of this project, HS2 is now a reality - heading north, creating jobs and building a brighter future for our country. \n\"This vital project is at the heart of the government's commitments to build back better from the pandemic, tackle the North-South divide and drive growth across the country.\n\"I look forward to seeing spades in the ground to get this section built and deliver the benefits of high-speed rail to the North as swiftly as possible.\"\nBut critics argue that the justification for building HS2 was ever-increasing rail passenger numbers. And the government now admits future passenger growth is unknowable. \nHS2 Minister Andrew Stephenson recently said: \"If the first reaction to the pandemic is to cancel major infrastructure projects committed to by successive governments now for more than a decade\u2026 that would have a chilling impact on the construction sector in the UK and inward investment.\u201d\nCaroline Davies, BBC transport correspondent\nA year since the prime minister announced that HS2 would be built, another phase has been given the go ahead. But this project still has more hurdles to go. \nWhile phase 2a was anticipated to be signed off, the rest of the proposed route - from Crewe to Manchester and the eastern leg, connecting Birmingham and Leeds - are both still in the works. Businesses and local politicians campaigning for these routes have called on the government to commit to the rest of the project to avoid an east-west divide in transport in the North.\nThe project still has its critics, from environmental campaigners to those who argue new capacity isn't needed with new remote ways of working. \nPassenger services won't start on the first parts of the line until at least 2029, and arguments about the project aren't over yet.\nMPs voted overwhelmingly for the project, but some still question its value for money.\nChesham and Amersham MP Dame Cheryl Gillan asked whether the cost could be justified when ministers \u201chave not established that the future use of public transport will be at a level that will make this railway viable in any way, shape or form?\u201d\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas called it a \u201cvanity project\u201d. She says travel patterns have been revolutionised during Covid, and won't return to previous levels. And she complained: \u201cIt\u2019ll take decades for the project to have even a chance of becoming carbon neutral because of the emissions from building the line. \n\"Meanwhile dozens of ancient woodlands are being put at risk or damaged \u2013 the very woodlands we should be protecting to help tackle climate change.\u201d\nGreen campaigners are still hiding out in tunnels under Euston station to make their protest against the scheme\u2019s impact on the climate and wildlife.\nTony May, Emeritus Transport Professor at Leeds University, said: \u201cEven on optimistic predictions HS2 takes 65 years from its completion  before its carbon saving (through low-carbon trains) has offset the carbon costs of construction. \n\u201cSo up to 2050 (the critical deadline for achieving nearly zero emissions) HS2 is a carbon burden on the country. It doesn't save carbon at all.\u201d The company says it is working on smarter designs to reduce the carbon impact of the materials it uses.\nThe first phase of HS2 between London and the West Midlands is already well underway. There are 240 sites now active along the Phase One route.\nHS2 says it employs over 13,000 people with 400 apprenticeships, and tens of thousands more jobs supported through the supply chain. \nPassenger services are scheduled to start between stations at London\u2019s Old Oak Common and Birmingham Curzon Street between 2029-33. Phase 2A\u2019s opening will coincide with the London\u2013Birmingham route. HS2 A will carry six long-distance high speed services per hour. \nSara Williams, chief executive of Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce, said: \u201cExtending the high speed line northwards will generate thousands of contract opportunities for local businesses and provide a vital boost for the Staffordshire economy.\u201d\nCritics say the government could have created far more jobs for the same amount of money by developing a labour-intensive national scheme to renovate leaky homes \u2013 an activity that would actively reduce carbon emissions.

      "tags": "Scotland Brexit,Coronavirus lockdown measures,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Hospitality industry,UK economy,Economic effects of Brexit,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic,Trade",
      "text": "Scotland's food and drink industry is warning of price rises and potential shortages when new Brexit rules on imports come into force in April.\nThe UK's departure from the European Union has already led to a forest of new paperwork for firms exporting to the continent.\nAccording to James Withers, of trade body Scotland Food and Drink, the impact has been \"horrendous\".\nHe says the seafood sector alone was losing \"about a million pounds a day\".\n\"There's no sign of any improvement soon,\" Mr Withers says. \"In fact [there are] many signs things could get worse.\"\nThe UK government said it was working closely with businesses to make sure they could \"take advantage of the opportunities\" that leaving the European Union brings.\nIt said businesses were adjusting well to the new trade rules, which are being phased in over the next few months, and it was offering extensive advice and support. \nWhen Great Britain finally left the single market on Hogmanay the EU insisted on the immediate introduction of controls on exports to the continent but the UK government opted to wait until 1 April to introduce similar checks on imports.\nMr Withers says: \"Those checks, when they're put in place, could also make things slow, more expensive and a lot more complex for EU businesses who need to sell products into businesses here. \n\"And that's a big issue for supermarkets and will be a big issue for many food companies who get ingredients from Europe.\"\nOne of those companies is Charles Stamper Fruit and Veg in Edinburgh which sources much of its produce from Spain and the Netherlands.\nManaging director Louise Stamper says: \"One thing for certain is prices will go up. \n\"It's going to just become very expensive to go out for a meal.\"\nMs Stamper founded the firm 32 years ago with her husband, Charles. They normally supply fresh fruit, vegetables and other produce to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes.\nLike many businesses they saw a heavy impact last year due to the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns.\nMs Stamper says the first lockdown in March last year saw them lose all but a handful of their customers.\nSwitching to home deliveries helped but they didn't come close to making up for the lost trade. A year ago the firm employed 30 people. Now it has 15 staff.\nMaking matters worse, Ms Stamper says imports are 20% more expensive than they were last winter, a rise which she attributes in part to Brexit-related border disruption.\nMr Withers reckons that the enforced closure of hospitality, entertainment and tourism due to Covid cost food and drink firms \u00a33bn in lost sales in 2020, in a sector worth \u00a315bn annually to the country's economy, including \u00a36bn of exports.\nJim Cummiskey, chief executive of food wholesaler Failte Group, says the impact of the pandemic has been massive.\n\"To sum up the hospitality industry in one word: horrendous,\" he says.\nThe Glasgow giant is based beside a huge food market at Blochairn in the north of the city and has three arms: produce, food service and wholesale.\n\"We've paid off probably 17 staff,\" says Mr Cummiskey, glancing around at empty shelves in a vast refrigerated warehouse which he says would usually be crammed with fresh produce.\n\"People just seem to think you can switch the lights back on and everything's going to be back to normal. That's not going to happen in this industry. It's going to take years of recovery,\" he says.\nCompared to the effects of the pandemic Mr Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation.\nBad weather rather than Brexit is to blame for seasonal price rises on continental goods, he argues.\n\"The UK will diversify,\" insists Mr Cummiskey. \"We always have and we always will. So we'll store more Scottish product when it's in season and we'll store more UK product when it's in season.\"\nSome businesses which export to the EU are not so relaxed.\nWilma Finlay and her husband David run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway, famous for its ice cream and visitor centre.\nWhen the nation was ordered to stay at home in March last year, and again this winter, tourism and ice cream sales to restaurants collapsed.\nThe impact on turnover was \"massive\" says Ms Finlay, \"absolutely massive\".\nLuckily the farm had recently branched out into the production of cheese with the creation of a company called The Ethical Dairy.\n\"Home delivery has just taken off,\" she explains.\n\"It went from 30 orders a week to 300 orders a week almost overnight.\"\nThat's nothing like enough to offset the farm's ice cream and tourism losses but if Scotland were still in the EU, says Ms Finlay, she would now be taking the cheese enterprise to the next stage by ramping up exports to the continent.\nThe additional costs of Brexit have put paid to that ambition. They amount, she calculates, to \u00a345 in time and paperwork on every \u00a335 order. That's before she has even considered the cost of production or postage.\n\"It's just a non-starter,\" says Ms Finlay who describes the impact of Brexit as an \"annoyance\" and the pandemic as \"devastating\".\nWhat really surprised the Finlays though was the realisation that the EU-mandated checks and paperwork would also apply to trade with Northern Ireland where they had developed a number of loyal customers.\nThe reason lies in the deal formalising the UK's exit from the EU which allowed Northern Ireland to remain in the single market to prevent the potentially incendiary return of an Irish land border.\nInstead there is now an Irish Sea border: dividing the UK, outraging unionists and leading to shortages of some goods in Northern Ireland.\n\"We hadn't seen that [Brexit] would also close the route to Northern Ireland because we're actually physically nearer to Belfast than we are to Glasgow and Edinburgh,\" says Ms Finlay who says she was deeply disappointed to be forced to stop supplying her Northern Irish customers.\nThe disruption of commerce is also have an effect on the constitutional debate.\nIn the 2016 referendum Brexit was supported by majorities of voters in England and Wales - and therefore by the UK overall - but it was opposed by 62% of people who cast ballots in Scotland and 56% in Northern Ireland.\nSince then support for Scottish independence has risen, with more than 20 polls in a row indicating a majority in favour of Scotland going it alone, and there has also been renewed discussion about the possibility of a referendum - known as a border poll - on Irish reunification.\nFor now though a more pressing concern for business is the effect of the new checks and charges on imports from the EU to Britain due to come into effect on 1 April and whether they will lead to the shortages in Northern Ireland being replicated elsewhere in the UK?\nMr Withers of Scotland Food and Drink is concerned.\n\"At the moment supply chains are pretty robust,\" he says. \"The big supermarkets know what they are doing but if the lessons of the first few weeks in trying to get products out of the country are replicated for products coming into the country, we could find a real challenge.\"\nFresh fruit and vegetables are particularly vulnerable, he warns, especially when they are out of season in Scotland.\nHe says: \"What I do know is we sell \u00a31.2bn of Scottish food into the European Union every year and that has got an awful lot more difficult, an awful lot more expensive and an awful lot slower.\""

      "text": "The Met Office says an overnight temperature of -23C (-9.4F) recorded in Scotland is the lowest in more than 25 years.\nBBC weather presenter Simon King described the temperatures in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, as \"incredible\".\nIt was the lowest February temperature since 1955, and the UK's coldest night since 30 December 1995.\nA Met Office yellow snow and ice warning is in place for large parts of the country until 12:00 on Friday.\nScotRail said the winter weather was causing major problems for its services on Thursday morning.\nMr King said cold air from Siberia and the Arctic - known as the Beast from the East - had sent temperatures \"plummeting\" over the last week.\n\"While we've all experienced the cold wind, it's over the last couple of nights the temperature has got really low, especially in northern Scotland,\" he said.\n\"There are three reasons for this: thick snow on the ground, clear skies and light winds.\"\nHe said that a covering of snow traps the warmth in the ground.\n\"So when night falls, where the ground would normally radiate heat to the air, that heat can't get out so the air temperature is lower,\" he explained.\n\"If skies are clear, any heat that does get out of the ground, escapes into space.\n\"Wind normally mixes the air close to the surface, so at night it'll mix the warmth coming from the ground and keep temperatures up. When the wind is light and there's no warmth from the ground, the temperature can fall to levels you normally find in your freezer. Just like we've seen in northern Scotland.\"\nMalcolm MacIntyre, of the Braemar Mountain Rescue Team, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: \"It is a beautiful morning actually and it is really cold.\n\"The snow is squeaky, which always signifies that it is really cold.\n\"But in some ways once it gets below about minus 10/12, as long as it is not windy, it just feels really crisp and clear.\" \nScottish Water said it was dealing with double the normal number of burst pipes for the time of year as temperatures plunged.\nHundreds of burst pipes have been reported in the past week.\nAbout 29,000 properties were left without water on Wednesday night in the east end of Glasgow after a mains pipe burst.\nScottish Water has also brought in divers to break up ice in reservoirs at Stornoway on Lewis and Kinlochbervie in the Highlands. The build-up of ice was affecting supplies.\nThe company said it had not previously used so many divers in a such a short period of time.\nPolice in Tayside charged a man with dangerous driving after being stopped in Dundee with snow covering almost his entire front and rear windscreens.\nThey said it was \"about the most extreme example of lack of preparation\" that they had ever seen.\nOfficers said the man had been driving with \"practically zero-visibility\" when stopped.\nIn stark contrast, firefighters worked through the night to tackle a large wildfire in the Western Isles.\nThe blaze on Benbecula was reported at 15:30 on Wednesday and extended across about 1km at its height.\nTraffic Scotland urged drivers not to leave home unless it is essential and ScotRail is encouraging people to check their journey before leaving the house.\nThe operator tweeted: \"We're currently seeing severe disruption across the network, particularly in the Central Belt with disruption affecting services to/from Glasgow Queen Street High Level and Edinburgh Waverley.\"\nOn Tuesday heavy snowfall caused widespread disruption across Scotland."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe coronavirus variant which was first detected in Kent last year\u00a0is set to become the world's dominant strain, according to the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme. Prof Sharon Peacock told the BBC's Newscast podcast the new variant has \"swept the country\" and \"it's going to sweep the world, in all probability\". The Kent variant was originally detected in September 2020 and has since been found in more than 50 countries. But\u00a0Prof Peacock said vaccines approved for use in the UK appeared to work well against the existing variants of the virus in the country. You can read more about coronavirus variations and mutations here, and take a look at the science behind the changes.\u00a0\nThe prisons watchdog says inmates in England are being kept locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day as part of efforts to prevent Covid-19 outbreaks in jails. Predictions that up to 2,000 prisoners would die in the outbreak in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But one inmate told inspectors that measures taken to keep them safe were like \"being imprisoned while you're in prison\". The prisons minister Lucy Frazer told the BBC that actions taken by front-line staff had \"significantly limited\" the spread of the virus and prisoners are being supported.\nPeople who need \"continuous or repeated\" steroid use because of asthma are to be prioritised for the Covid vaccine. The government has decided that anyone who needs steroids for their asthma will be able to get a jab, after healthy over-65s have been vaccinated and before people who are younger with no health conditions. It is thought this should be done by May. Asthma charities say it may be hard to identify everyone who is eligible and health officials should \"cast the net wide\" to ensure people won't be missed.\nWales' first minister has said that the country is one of the first in the world - and the first UK nation - to get a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine into the arms of a fifth of the population. Mark Drakeford confirmed more than 655,000 people (20.8%) had been given their jabs. Across the rest of the UK, England's total has reached more than 11 million doses, which is 19.7% of the population, while Scotland's rate has risen to 18% and Northern Ireland's is 17.6%.\nAfter Nikki Hazlehurst lost her job last year as a member of airline cabin crew, she applied for work at the Nightingale Hospital in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. \"I went from drinks, snacks and really happy people to somewhere there's a lot of doom and gloom. It's scary,\" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat. But she adds that her customer service skills \"have really helped\" and that lugging cages around the hospital is not unlike moving catering trolleys on a plane. But Nikki really hopes to be back in the air in 12 months - along with her partner, who recently got his commercial pilot's licence.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "Rail travel,Birmingham,HS2,Manchester,Crewe,Environment,Leeds",
      "text": "The go-ahead for the next phase of Britain\u2019s controversial HS2 high-speed rail network has been approved.\nPhase 2A of the project will be built from the West Midlands to Crewe, and was given Royal Assent on Thursday.\nSupporters of HS2 say it will spur economic growth, help level up the country, and provide greener transport.\nBut environmentalists say it will increase carbon emissions and can\u2019t be justified now people have embraced video conferencing such as Zoom. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"Whatever your view of this project, HS2 is now a reality - heading north, creating jobs and building a brighter future for our country. \n\"This vital project is at the heart of the government's commitments to build back better from the pandemic, tackle the North-South divide and drive growth across the country.\n\"I look forward to seeing spades in the ground to get this section built and deliver the benefits of high-speed rail to the North as swiftly as possible.\"\nBut critics argue that the justification for building HS2 was ever-increasing rail passenger numbers. And the government now admits future passenger growth is unknowable. \nHS2 Minister Andrew Stephenson recently said: \"If the first reaction to the pandemic is to cancel major infrastructure projects committed to by successive governments now for more than a decade\u2026 that would have a chilling impact on the construction sector in the UK and inward investment.\u201d\nCaroline Davies, BBC transport correspondent\nA year since the prime minister announced that HS2 would be built, another phase has been given the go ahead. But this project still has more hurdles to go. \nWhile phase 2a was anticipated to be signed off, the rest of the proposed route - from Crewe to Manchester and the eastern leg, connecting Birmingham and Leeds - are both still in the works. Businesses and local politicians campaigning for these routes have called on the government to commit to the rest of the project to avoid an east-west divide in transport in the North.\nThe project still has its critics, from environmental campaigners to those who argue new capacity isn't needed with new remote ways of working. \nPassenger services won't start on the first parts of the line until at least 2029, and arguments about the project aren't over yet.\nMPs voted overwhelmingly for the project, but some still question its value for money.\nChesham and Amersham MP Dame Cheryl Gillan asked whether the cost could be justified when ministers \u201chave not established that the future use of public transport will be at a level that will make this railway viable in any way, shape or form?\u201d\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas called it a \u201cvanity project\u201d. She says travel patterns have been revolutionised during Covid, and won't return to previous levels. And she complained: \u201cIt\u2019ll take decades for the project to have even a chance of becoming carbon neutral because of the emissions from building the line. \n\"Meanwhile dozens of ancient woodlands are being put at risk or damaged \u2013 the very woodlands we should be protecting to help tackle climate change.\u201d\nGreen campaigners are still hiding out in tunnels under Euston station to make their protest against the scheme\u2019s impact on the climate and wildlife.\nTony May, Emeritus Transport Professor at Leeds University, said: \u201cEven on optimistic predictions HS2 takes 65 years from its completion  before its carbon saving (through low-carbon trains) has offset the carbon costs of construction. \n\u201cSo up to 2050 (the critical deadline for achieving nearly zero emissions) HS2 is a carbon burden on the country. It doesn't save carbon at all.\u201d The company says it is working on smarter designs to reduce the carbon impact of the materials it uses.\nThe first phase of HS2 between London and the West Midlands is already well underway. There are 240 sites now active along the Phase One route.\nHS2 says it employs over 13,000 people with 400 apprenticeships, and tens of thousands more jobs supported through the supply chain. \nPassenger services are scheduled to start between stations at London\u2019s Old Oak Common and Birmingham Curzon Street between 2029-33. Phase 2A\u2019s opening will coincide with the London\u2013Birmingham route. HS2 A will carry six long-distance high speed services per hour. \nSara Williams, chief executive of Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce, said: \u201cExtending the high speed line northwards will generate thousands of contract opportunities for local businesses and provide a vital boost for the Staffordshire economy.\u201d\nCritics say the government could have created far more jobs for the same amount of money by developing a labour-intensive national scheme to renovate leaky homes \u2013 an activity that would actively reduce carbon emissions.

      "tags": "Social care,Simon Stevens,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Plans to adequately fund the social care sector need to be in place within a year, the head of NHS England has said.\nSir Simon Stevens told the BBC the Covid-19 crisis had shone a \"very harsh spotlight\" on the \"resilience\" of the care system. \nHe said there was a need to \"decisively answer\" how high quality care could be provided long-term. \nThe Department of Health said it would bring forward a plan for reform.  \nIn their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Sir Simon said the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to give momentum to plans to overhaul how the system works.\n\"If any good is to come from this, we must use this as a moment to resolve once and for all to actually properly resource and reform the way in which social care works in this country,\" he said. \n\"The reality is that after at least two decades of talking about it, we do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system with a proper set of workforce supports.\"\nHe added: \"I would hope by the time we are sitting down this time next year on the 73rd birthday of the NHS that we have actually, as a country, been able to decisively answer the question of how are we going to fund and provide high-quality social care for my parents' generation.\n\"If you take back the history coming out of the Second World War, the country at that point was on austerity. We had rationing for bread and potatoes.\n\"The founders of the NHS did not use that as a moment to hesitate, they said, 'let one of the legacies of the war be the creation of the NHS'.\n\"That's the same legacy we need for long-term care support in social care coming out of coronavirus.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he agreed with NHS England chief executive Sir Simon.\n\"The system needs a huge amount of work - it has been broken for a long time,\" Sir Keir said.\n\"I think it has been fractured, it's been underfunded, I think the staff have been undervalued and underpaid, and the prime minister needs to take responsibility.\n\"The Conservative government has been in power for 10 years and therefore they've had time to start doing something about social care - they haven't done it.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it had set out a \"comprehensive action plan\" to support social care in England during the pandemic. \n\"We know there's a need for a long-term solution for social care and there are complex questions to address,\" they added. \n\"We will bring forward a plan that puts social care on a sustainable footing to ensure the reforms will last long into the future.\"\nAdult social care encompasses the support provided by councils to older people and younger adults with disabilities.\nUnlike health care, social care is not generally provided for free. In England, anyone with assets over \u00a323,250 is expected to pay for some or all of their costs, leading to the prospect of some having to sell their homes to pay for care. \nServices have also been stretched as a result of years of funding cuts from government and growing demand linked to an ageing population. \nIn Scotland, free personal care is available. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland.\nPolitical parties have been talking about reforming the sector for the past 20 years.\nThe Conservatives previously brought forward legislation for a cap on care costs, but the plan was scrapped amid concerns about the costs of implementation.\nHowever, the idea was again considered by ministers in the current government prior to the coronavirus outbreak.\nAt December's election, the government pledged an extra \u00a31bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. \nIt has subsequently given an extra \u00a33.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. \nMinisters have also promised an additional \u00a3600m for care homes to help with controlling infections.\nDo you work in a care home?

      "tags": "Companies,Online dating",
      "text": "No bumbling here: Dating app Bumble, which made its name by putting women in charge of making contact with potential mates, has soared to a market value of more than $13bn after listing shares.\nIts Wall Street success made 31-year-old boss Whitney Wolfe Herd a rare self-made female billionaire.\nBumble, which also owns Badoo, is one of less than two dozen US firms to list publicly while led by a female founder.\nShares in the firm debuted at $43 apiece, valuing it at over $8bn. \nBut in opening trade on Thursday they shot up to more than $76 each, making the firm worth more than $13bn (\u00a39.4bn).\nMs Wolfe Herd launched Bumble in Texas in 2014, with backing from Russian billionaire Andreey Andreev, the founder of European online dating site Badoo. \nShe has said she was inspired to create a platform where women \"make the first move\" by her frustration with archaic gender norms controlling dating.\nUnlike most dating apps, only female users can make the first contact with matched male users, while in same-sex matches either person can send a message first.\n\"I have experienced firsthand how unequal relationships negatively impact all areas of life,\" she wrote in a letter to investors ahead of the share listing. \"I wanted to change this.\"\nMs Wolfe Herd, the youngest woman to take a company public in the US, also co-founded dating app Tinder, but left the firm alleging sexual harassment. \nTinder's parent company Match Group Inc, which denied the claims and later tried unsuccessfully to acquire Bumble, paid about $1m to settle the dispute.\nMs Wolfe Herd has led Bumble and Badoo since 2019 when Mr Andreev sold his stakes in both businesses to investment giant Blackstone. The two apps combined have 40 million active users, including more than 2.4 million paying customers.\nBumble, whose apps are available in more than 150 countries, has said it is poised for growth, pointing to the rising number of single people globally, increased adoption of online dating and signs that users have become more willing to pay.  \nThe firm is also expanding into new areas, like business networking.\nBut despite an uptick in use, the pandemic has hurt the business, which makes money primarily from subscriptions and in-app purchases.\nIn 2019, revenue jumped more than 35% and it turned a profit of $68.6m.\nIn the first nine months of 2020, however, its growth rate sank to roughly 15% year-on-year, and it posted a loss of $116m.\nIn recent months, investors have displayed strong appetite for shares of new listings, sending companies such as Airbnb and Doordash to sky-high valuations in their market debuts."

      "title": "Meghan: Mail on Sunday privacy damage 'runs deep'",
      "tags": "Media,UK Royal Family,Thomas Markle,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,The Royal Family and the media",
      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has welcomed her High Court privacy victory over the Mail on Sunday, saying the damage the publisher has done \"runs deep\". \nMeghan brought the claim against Associated Newspapers (ANL) over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. \nThe judge said Meghan had a \"reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private\".\nANL said it was surprised and disappointed by the judgment. \nMr Justice Warby granted Meghan \"summary judgment\" in her claim for misuse of private information against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, meaning that part of the case is resolved without a trial.\nHe said there would be a further hearing in March to decide \"the next steps\" in the legal action.\nMeghan, 39, sent the handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie, after having stepped back from their roles in the Royal Family.\nIn a judgment on Thursday, Mr Justice Warby ruled that the publication of the letter - which he described as \"a long-form telling-off\" - was \"manifestly excessive and hence unlawful\".\n\"It was, in short, a personal and private letter,\" he said.\n\"The majority of what was published was about the claimant's own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her father's behaviour - as she saw it - and the resulting rift between them.\n\"These are inherently private and personal matters.\"\nHe added: \"There is no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial.\"\nExtracts from the letter appeared in a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, alongside the headline: \"Revealed: the letter showing true tragedy of Meghan's rift with a father she says has 'broken her heart into a million pieces'\". \nIn a statement, the Duchess of Sussex said she was grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers to account \"for their illegal and dehumanising practices\". \n\"For these outlets, it's a game. For me and so many others, it's real life, real relationships, and very real sadness,\" she said. \n\"The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"\nMeghan said her \"comprehensive win\" means \"we have all won\", adding: \"We now know, and hope it creates legal precedent, that you cannot take somebody's privacy and exploit it in a privacy case, as the defendant has blatantly done over the past two years.\"\nA spokesman for ANL said: \"We are very surprised by today's summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial.\n\"We are carefully considering the judgment's contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal.\" \nLawyers for ANL had claimed Meghan wrote the letter \"with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point\" in order to \"defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter\".\nDuring a remote hearing in January, Mr Markle said in a witness statement he had wanted the letter published to \"set the record straight\" about his relationship with his daughter - a claim one of Meghan's lawyers described as \"ridiculous\".\nThis is a thumping victory for Meghan. \nThe court dismissed Associated Newspapers' defence on privacy and copyright; the only ongoing dispute is about whose copyright has been breached, as there is some argument over whether it was just the duchess that wrote the letter or whether she had some assistance. \nSo is Meghan and Harry's long struggle with sections of the British media now finished? Harry has settled his case against the Mail on Sunday; Meghan has won hers. \nIt seems unlikely. The couple have instructed their UK spokespeople not to talk to the country's most popular newspapers. They clearly think they simply can't get a fair hearing. \nAnd the coverage they receive is pretty critical; baiting the couple over their new lives in California is now something of a routine.\nTo the couple it may well be immaterial. Their lives are elsewhere now.  \nBut their relationship with the British public is still, largely, mediated by newspapers they will not deal with and which take delight in doing them down. \nThe couple have won - but they have also lost.\nMedia lawyer Mark Stephens said he envisages the newspaper publisher will seek to go to the Court of Appeal \"to have a more definitive ruling on what the law is going forward\".\n\"If you can't effectively report on leaked letters then in those circumstances the media holding people to account is going to be hampered,\" he said. \n\"Essentially this judgement in its widest context puts manacles on the media.\"\nMeghan is seeking damages for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over five articles published in February 2019, which included extracts from the letter.\nThe judge made two rulings on the case for copyright infringement. \nHe found the publication of the letter infringed the duchess's copyright. But he said the issue of whether Meghan was \"the sole author\" of the letter or Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was a \"co-author\" should be determined at a trial.\nThe data protection claim was not considered at the hearing in January and is still outstanding.\nHowever, Mr Stephens said that by winning her privacy claim Meghan could say she had been \"vindicated\" and he expected she would drop the other parts of the case \"as soon as she can\". \nThe full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court in January, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021 for a \"confidential\" reason. \nWhen his wife first began her legal action against the Mail on Sunday, the Duke of Sussex spoke about the \"painful\" impact of the \"ruthless\" press campaign against her. \n\"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,\" he said in a statement at the time. \nReferring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry said his \"deepest fear is history repeating itself\"."

      "text": "Scotland's transport secretary says he is pressing the UK government to close a loophole which could allow travellers to avoid new Covid quarantine rules.\nMichael Matheson told BBC Scotland the current UK arrangements for enforced isolation in hotels were \"inadequate\".\nNew UK quarantine rules only apply to people arriving from 33 countries deemed \"high risk\", but Scotland's apply to all international travellers.\nThere are fears traveller could avoid the rules by flying into England first.\nEveryone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at a cost of \u00a31,750.\nThe Scottish government has block-booked rooms at six hotels near Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.\nMr Matheson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme he believed there should be a \"comprehensive system\" across the UK on managed isolation to reduce the risk of importing variants of Covid-19.\n\"Our preferred option would be for individuals to be required to self-isolate at the point of entry into the UK, rather than travelling from one part of the UK to self-isolate when they get into Scotland or Northern Ireland or any other part of the UK,\" he said.\n\"[The UK government] want to continue to take a targeted approach on the way in which individuals enter into ports of entry in England.\n\"Our view is that remains inadequate in order to prevent the risk of new variants entering into the country and that is why we we're continuing to pursue and press the UK government to listen to the clinical advice and expert opinion from the Joint Biosecurity Centre that the existing system operating isn't adequate.\"\nAsked if Scotland would introduce controls on the border with England to ensure people travelling to Scotland via an English airport were complying, Mr Matheson said the Scottish government was looking at a \"range of measures\".\nThe \u00a31,750 cost of the stay in managed quarantine will have to be paid for by the passengers themselves.\nThe charge includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs. \nAnyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct.\nMr Matheson told the BBC that about 1,600 people travelled to Scotland from abroad last week.\n\"If you take out those who would be subject to an exemption, we estimate there would be the need for potentially around 1,200 individuals to self-isolate in a managed quarantine facility,\" he said.\n\"One of the things that may happen as a result of the policy we have taken forward, is that some of the airlines may choose to draw back on their international flights into Scotland.\n\"And there is some indication that the airlines may choose to cancel their flights coming into Scotland next week as a result of the managed isolation provision we have put in place, on the basis that they believe the demand for those flights is going to drop off dramatically as a result.\"\nThe oil and gas industry has said the 10-day quarantines could have a massive impact on business.\nTrevor Stapleton, from industry body Oil and Gas UK said: \"Given that they are doing critical roles and that the rotas have been planned a good year in advance, to suddenly say that that individual cannot go offshore - and therefore they have to quarantine for 10 days - would have a couple of outcomes.\n\"If they are doing a critical role then either they... have to stay on the installation for a further 10 days, and if that's not possible, if the person has to come back, then you are looking quite seriously at whether you can continue to operate that installation.\"\nMr Matheson said that there would be \"some level of exemptions\" provided for some passengers.\n\"We're looking at particular aspects around the oil and gas sector and also around areas such as defence and areas of critical infrastructure as well,\" he added.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday that new UK border measures built on \"touch actions\" already taken to prevent news variants of Covid-19 entering the country.\nHe also said that the UK government was working on \"similarly tough schemes with the devolved administrations\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus variant first found in Kent could become the world's dominant strain, the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme has predicted.\nProf Sharon Peacock told the BBC's Newscast podcast the new variant has \"swept the country\" and \"it's going to sweep the world, in all probability\".\nShe said her team's work sequencing variants of the virus could be required for at least 10 years.\nThe Kent variant has already been detected in more than 50 countries.\nIt was first detected in September 2020 in south-east England and its rapid spread over the following months was cited as the reason for the introduction of new lockdown rules across the UK in January.\nProf Peacock, director of the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, said: \"What's really affected us at the moment is transmissibility.\"\nShe added: \"Once we get on top of [the virus] or it mutates itself out of being virulent - causing disease - then we can stop worrying about it. But I think, looking in the future, we're going to be doing this for years. We're still going to be doing this 10 years down the line, in my view.\"\nShe explained this was not because she thought the pandemic would go on for 10 years, but she believed they would be sequencing new variants for that length of time.\nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well.\nProf Peacock said the vaccines approved for use in the UK appeared to work well against the existing variants of the virus in the country.\nThe Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium is a network of public health bodies and labs and currently analyses more than 20,000 positive tests a week. \nIn recent weeks, it has been explained that about 5-10% of positive tests are selected randomly to be sent on for further genome analysis but the consortium says, as the number of cases falls below its capacity, its aim is to genetically screen every positive coronavirus test.\nProf Peacock told Newscast that while it is normal to see variants, only a very small number have \"special features\". These can make them more transmissible, avoid the immune response and affect vaccination, or have the potential to cause more severe disease. \n\"These are the things we are looking out for. I'd say it happens vanishingly rarely but we have to be on the look out for it,\" the expert, who was previously director of the government's National Infection Service, said.\nIt comes as the World Health Organization is recommending using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine even in countries tackling new variants of coronavirus.\nThe Oxford jab has attracted controversy about its effectiveness against new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data.\nEarly data from trials in South Africa - where a variant has acquired mutations that seem to help it evade immunity from vaccines and from previous infections - showed the vaccine was offering \"minimal protection\" against mild and moderate disease in young people.\nBut the WHO's director of immunisation, Dr Katherine O'Brien, said the South African study was \"inconclusive\" and it was \"plausible\" the vaccine would still prevent severe disease.\nOxford scientists still expect their vaccine to prevent people from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and needing hospital treatment.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the two million people yet to take up their offer of a Covid jab to \"come forward\" this week.\nThe government is aiming to offer a first dose of a vaccine to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February.\nAs of Tuesday 13,058,298 had received a first vaccine dose, a daily rise of 411,812."

      "text": "Nearly 225,000 people in England have now waited more than 12 months for routine hospital treatment - the highest number since April 2008, NHS England figures show.\nThis includes people waiting for planned knee and hip surgery.\nIt comes as growing numbers of operations were postponed during December when Covid cases rose rapidly.\nIn January 2021 alone, hospitals treated nearly a third of all patients with Covid since the pandemic began.\nProfessor Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said staff had worked extremely hard to provide essential services during the pandemic. \nHe added: \"Even in January, when hospitals admitted almost a third of all the Covid patients they have treated during the pandemic, they were treating twice as many patients with other conditions as they did for those with the virus over the month.\n\"But the NHS remains under significant pressure so it is vital that everyone continues to do all they can to stop the spread of the virus by  staying at home and following the expert 'hands, face, space' guidance.\"\nDespite Covid, NHS England says more than six million elective treatments were completed last year and average waiting times for non-urgent surgery fell by more than 40% between July and the end of the year.\nThe Royal College of Surgeons of England, said Covid-19 continued to take an enormous toll on hundreds of thousands of people across the country left waiting for an operation. \nVice president, Mr Tim Mitchell, said the number waiting over a year for their treatment was now 150 times higher than it had been in 2019.  \n\"Many are waiting in limbo, reliant on painkillers, and unable to get on with day-to-day family life or work,\" he said.\nAlthough infection rates are now coming down in many parts of the country, Mr Mitchell warned many staff were \"burnt-out\" from what had been \"a brutal and traumatic year\" and would need time to recover.\nThe figures suggest cancer services are recovering. \nDuring December, just over 200,000 patients received urgent checks by cancer specialists and 25,000 people started their treatment - both measures are in line with numbers seen before the pandemic.\nBut Sara Bainbridge, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said 2020 had been a \"devastating year\" for many people living with cancer \"who faced agonising delays or disruption to diagnosis and treatment\".\nShe urged anyone experiencing cancer symptoms to contact their GP without delay and go to medical appointments."

      "tags": "HM Inspectorate of Prisons,UK prisons",
      "text": "Prisoners in England's jails have been locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day to keep them safe from Covid-19, the prisons watchdog says. \nAnd the extra restrictions, which began in March, have led to a decline in their mental and physical health and a rise in drug taking and self-harm.  \n\"It's being imprisoned while you're in prison,\" one inmate told inspectors.\nPredictions up to 2,000 inmates would die in the pandemic in England and Wales without action have been avoided.\nBut inspectors who visited a cross-section of jails, interviewing male and female prisoners as well as young offenders, found the long-term consequences of such an extended and restrictive regime could be \"profound\", with some newly released offenders ill-prepared for life outside. \nNormally, adult prisoners should spend between eight and 10 hours a day outside their cells.\nBut pandemic restrictions have meant the suspension of:\nGyms have been closed.\nAnd prisoners must cram daily tasks, such as showers and exercise, into the short period they are allowed out of their cells.\nPrisoners told inspectors they felt like \"caged animals\" and passed their time rearranging their possessions or varying when they sat on their bed or a chair. \nThe lack of interventions for prisoners approaching their release date has already had an impact, according to social-justice charity Nacro.\nMiriam Khan, a reducing-reoffending officer in a men's category-B prison in South Yorkshire, told BBC News she was already seeing the most vulnerable men reoffending and returning to jail.\n\"When I have asked them, 'What are you doing back?' it's because they are struggling massively with their mental health and not being able to access support. \n\"Because everything is over the phone, they don't have the skill set to do it.\n\"Even their probation appointments have to be pre-booked, so they don't see them as much anymore\".\nInspectors also highlighted the issue of \"doubling up\", where two prisoners share a cell designed for one. \nIn lockdown, prisoners have to eat their meals in cells that sometimes have unscreened or uncovered toilets. \n\"You can hate someone for no reason, can't you? Being in the cell with them every day,\" said one prisoner, who shared. \nChief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor said: \"Many months after the introduction of these restrictions, most adult prisoners were still locked in their cell for an average of 22.5 hours a day, seven days a week.\"\n\"We have heard suggestions that the restrictions, and a subsequent reduction in recorded violent incidents, have made prisons safer.\n\"Clearly with so little time out of cell, prisoners had less opportunity to be violent or fight.\n\"But this was not the full picture according to those we interviewed. \n\"Prisoners said that violence, intimidation and bullying had not stopped but had instead taken other forms. \n\"The accrual of debt persisted.\n\"And some had turned to using drugs and other unhealthy coping strategies as a way of managing their isolation and boredom.\"\nSeparately, the governor of an adult men's jail, speaking anonymously, said prisons were \"at a point of absolute crisis\".\n\"The pressure has been relentless for months and months,\" the governor said.\n\"I simply do not know how staff and prisoners are coping.\n\"Morale is at rock bottom.\n\"And with increasing numbers of positive cases amongst prisoners and staff, and large numbers of staff having to self-isolate, it is increasingly difficult to ensure that even the basics get done. \n\"It is vital that prison staff are treated as a priority occupation for vaccination, as the current situation simply cannot continue.\"\nOne officer, also speaking anonymously, said there were currently 150 staff off sick or self-isolating at the high-security prison where he worked. \nPrisoners told the inspectors they had understood the need for the lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic.\nBut the continued restrictions had led to \"despondency, resentment and lack of hope\".\n\"At the beginning, you could put up with it because you had the mental strength,\" one said.\n\"You wonder how much more you can actually tolerate.\"\nPrisons and Probation Minister Lucy Frazer QC said: \"As this report recognises, the action we've taken and the hard work and dedication of front-line staff has significantly limited the spread of the virus, saved lives and protected the NHS.\n\"We know these necessary measures have come at a cost, so we continue to support prisoners with their well-being and rehabilitation through vital family contact, education, work and exercise. \n\"I will consider the report's findings carefully as we continue to work hard to protect the lives of staff and prisoners and cut crime.\""

      "text": "The head of the Tokyo Olympics organising committee has resigned after he was criticised for making \"inappropriate\" remarks about women.\nYoshiro Mori, 83, was quoted as saying women talk too much and that meetings with many female board directors would \"take a lot of time\".\nThe remarks set off a firestorm of protest and Mr Mori apologised at the time but said he would not resign.\nBut on Friday he apologised for his \"inappropriate statement\".\n\"What is important is to hold the Olympics from July. It must not be the case that my presence becomes an obstacle to that,\" he said at a special committee meeting on Friday, where he also announced his resignation. \nIt is not immediately clear who will replace Mr Mori, a former Japanese prime minister. He had initially selected well-known sports administrator Saburo Kawabuchi, 84, to replace him but this also led to protests. \nThe resignation came as pressure mounted on him over the past week. Major sponsors came forward to criticise his comments, including Toyota, one of the biggest Olympic backers.\nToyota's president Akio Toyoda said the company was \"disappointed\".\nOn Tuesday, a group of female lawmakers wore white in a protest against his remarks, with some men doing the same in solidarity. \nAnd Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said she would not attend a meeting of high-level Olympic officials in protest. \nAccording to local media, almost 400 people have also withdrawn applications to volunteer at the Olympic games, which are scheduled for later this year. \nThe committee board currently has 24 members, five of whom are women. In 2019, the committee - which is responsible for selecting Japanese Olympians - set itself a goal of increasing the number of female board directors to 40%.\n\"If we increase the number of female board members, we have to make sure their speaking time is restricted somewhat, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying,\" Mr Mori was quoted as saying. \n\"We have about seven women at the organising committee, but everyone understands their place.\"\nMr Mori is known in the country for a string of gaffes and undiplomatic statements made while in office from 2000 to 2001.\nHe told Japan's Mainichi newspaper that female family members had also lambasted him after his comments.\n\"Last night, my wife gave me a thorough scolding. She said: 'You've said something bad again, haven't you? I'm going to have to suffer again because you've antagonised women',\" he said.\n\"This morning, my daughter and granddaughter scolded me as well,\" the paper quoted him as saying."

      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,NHS Wales,NHS,Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "The NHS in England is to be reformed so health and care services can work more closely together, the government says.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the planned restructure will mean a focus \"on the health of the population, not just the health of patients\". \nBut Labour questioned the timing of the changes \"in the middle of the biggest public health crisis our NHS has ever faced\", saying staff were exhausted.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no better time than now\".\nA full White Paper was published on Thursday, setting out the proposed future legislation.\n\"The pandemic has made the changes in this White Paper more not less urgent,\" Mr Hancock told MPs.\nThe shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012.\nMinisters believe the changes will put the NHS in a better position to cope with an ageing population and a rise in people with complex health conditions.\nOne-in-three patients admitted to hospital as an emergency has five or more health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or asthma, up from one-in-10 a decade ago.\nThose working in the health service said many of the rules in place were time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. \nAnnouncing the changes to MPs, Mr Hancock said the new system would see the NHS and local councils take decisions about local health together.\n\"The new approach is based on the concept of population health,\" he said.\nOrganisations called \"integrated care systems\" - which already exist in some parts of the country - will be set up in each part of England and be responsible for funding to support that area's health.\n\"They will provide not just for the treatments that are needed but support people to stay healthy in the first place,\" said Mr Hancock.\nResponding to criticism over the timing, Mr Hancock said the pandemic had \"brought home the importance of preventing ill health in the first place\".\nNigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the changes would be a \"re-wiring behind the dashboard\" and should not be too noticeable to patients.\nWhile it was not a \"magic bullet\", it could help different parts of the system work more closely together, he added.\nThe public will be rightly asking what difference these reforms make and why they are being introduced now in the middle of a pandemic.\nThe concept predates Covid - councils and the NHS have been piloting these approaches to integrated care over the past few years.\nBut, in many ways, the pandemic has speeded up the process. With more care being done out of hospital because of the pressures from Covid, community NHS and council care teams have been working ever more closely.\nThere is much to recommend greater joined up working. The 21st century patient has multiple conditions.\nTake a 70-year-old with heart problem and dementia who lives alone. They will need input from a heart specialist, support from community nurses and maybe the company of a befriending service.\nThe staff needed could come from three different organisations working and funded separately.  It creates bureaucracy and it is not hard to see how the quality of care suffers.\nThe white paper is an attempt to re-wire the NHS. But those working for the NHS argue that is just one part of the solution - staffing and investment will also play a role.\nThe proposals include scrapping the tendering rule, which sees providers and private companies compete to win contracts to run services.\nThis rule made it complicated for councils and different parts of the NHS to set up joint teams and pool their budgets, with some having to set up separate bodies to bid for contracts.\nInstead, the NHS and councils will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other to pool resources.\nIt also gives the health secretary more control over NHS England and other national bodies, which had been given a large degree of autonomy under the 2012 changes.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had long argued for more integrated care, but raised questions over the timing.\nHe also said the test of the reorganisation \"will be whether it brings waiting lists and times down, widens access especially for mental healthcare, drives up cancer survival rates and improves population health\".\nMr Ashworth added that \"legislation alone of course is not the answer to integration. \n\"We need a long-term funded workforce plan. We've not got one. We need a sustainable social care plan. We were promised one on the steps of Downing Street. We still don't have one.\"\nThe UK's social care system is under pressure with past governments failing to reform or fund the council-run system properly. \nIn their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding.\nMr Hancock told MPs the government was \"committed to the reform of adult social care and will bring forward proposals this year\".\nMeanwhile, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the reform will create a \"flexible can-do spirit\" across the health and care system.\nThe White Paper will cite examples of good practice, such as a care team at the Royal Derby Hospital which sees nurses from the community, council care services and hospital staff working together to plan the discharge of patients.\nChris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS managers, said it would end \"an unnecessarily rigid NHS approach to procurement\".\nThe Local Government Association welcomed the plans but said they did not provide the funding to put care services on a \"sustainable and long-term footing\".

This is taking appointments from others.\n\"Please turn up when you have made an appointment. Please don't phone up if you are not eligible - you won't get a booking. And please be courteous to staff on the telephone lines.\n\"I fully understand people are anxious to get the protection that the vaccines offer. Let me assure everyone that we are rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as we can. While it is not a race, I believe our progress to date would be the envy of many other countries.\n\"Our rate of progress is limited by the availability of supplies. Further vaccine supplies will come and you will get your jab. Please be patient.\"\nMeanwhile, the department has appealed for people aged between 65 and 69-years-old to get their vaccine after demand has slowed since after an initial surge in demand when slots were made available for that age group late last month.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann told Stormont's health committee that the drop in the R number had \"undoubtedly saved lives\".\n\"We always need a period of time when R is as low as possible - to more quickly break those chains of infection which are resulting in people becoming sick and hospitalised and losing their lives,\" he said.\n\"Our health and social care needs time to deliver other care and that has been delayed or disrupted by the epidemic,\" he added.\nHe also discussed the issue of new variants of the virus and said the Kent variant now accounts for 40-60% of new cases in Northern Ireland.\nHe was also asked about what changes are being made to the Covid-19 strategy to avoid more cycles of lockdown and lifting of restrictions.\nHe said a lot had been learned from the first wave of the pandemic, and they have \"massively up-scaled\" the test, trace and protect (TTP) programme.\nHe said the average contact time is now six-and-a-half hours after a positive case.\nAt the peak of this wave in January, 12,000 cases were referred to TTP and contact success was 93.5%, he said.\nSince January, there has been an increase in the average number of contacts from one to two-and-a-half people despite the current restrictions in place, he added.\nMr Swann also said testing is being rolled out elsewhere - in workplaces, special schools, meat factories, Translink - and waste water was also being tested."

      "text": "A serial sex offender has been found guilty of raping and murdering a student before dumping her body in a river.\nPawel Relowicz, 26, prowled the streets of Hull before attacking \"vulnerable\" 21-year-old Libby Squire.\nJurors heard Relowicz had committed a string of offences against women prior to the killing.\nSpeaking outside Sheffield Crown Court, Libby's mother paid tribute to her \"beautiful, caring, wonderful girl\".\nDuring the trial, prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Relowicz had spent the night of 31 January 2019 driving around looking for a woman to attack.\nJurors heard University of Hull philosophy student Ms Squire, who had been turned away from a nightclub, was drunk and \"extremely vulnerable\" when Relowicz \"intercepted\" her .\nHe drove her to Oak Road playing fields, where he attacked her before putting her in the River Hull.\nProsecutors said the married father-of-two had repeatedly lied to police, his wife and in court documents about what happened on the night of Ms Squire's disappearance.\nHe maintained he had consensual sex with the student and said he had lied because he did not want his wife to find out he had cheated on her.\nAfter a massive search effort, Ms Squire's remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost two months later.\nHer parents, Lisa and Russ, held hands and cried as they sat in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom to await the verdicts.\nSpeaking outside court, Mrs Squire thanked supporters but said Relowicz's conviction \"changes nothing for us, there is no closure\".\n\"We don't get to have Libby back and our lives don't revert back to normal,\" she said.\n\"Libby will always be with us and we are all so proud of our beautiful, caring, wonderful girl.\n\"And, although she has been physically taken from us, the memories we have and the love we share will never be.\"\nPolish national Relowicz, a butcher, showed no emotion as the jury foreman read out the verdicts. He will be sentenced on Friday.\nJurors found him guilty of rape unanimously and guilty of murder by a majority verdict of 11 to one.\nPathologists were unable to establish how she died, or whether she was still alive when she went into the water. \nWitnesses reported hearing screams from the playing fields on the night she disappeared.\nGerry Wareham, from the Crown Prosecution Service said CCTV footage of Relowicz and Ms Squire's last known movements was \"crucial evidence\" in bringing the case to court.\nDuring the 14-day trial, the jury of seven women and five men heard Relowicz had previous convictions for voyeurism, performing sex acts in public and stealing sex toys and underwear from women's homes.\nOne of his previous voyeurism victims told the BBC she hoped the police would learn from the case.\nShe said his earlier offences were \"sufficiently minor\" by themselves \"to not actually require the level of investigation that would result in him being caught\". \nIn a statement, Humberside Police said it was \"satisfied\" with its investigation and that officers \"acted quickly\" to identify, locate and apprehend the defendant within days of Ms Squire's disappearance.\nDet Supt Martin Smalley said: \"I can understand that people are interested to know whether Libby's tragic death could have been prevented.  \n\"It is important to remember that whilst, taken as a whole, and with the benefit of hindsight, we may be able to point to a history of offending by Pawel Relowicz, officers investigating these offences at the time were doing so with far less information than we have now and that my investigation into Libby's disappearance had.\"\nThe University of Hull said it would continue to offer support to the student community.\nVice-Chancellor Prof Susan Lea said in a statement: \"What took place in February 2019 deeply affected everyone at the university and those within the local community. \n\"Libby made a huge impact during her time at Hull, and will be remembered fondly by all who met her.\"\nShe said the \"kindness and care shown by everyone was overwhelming\" both at the university and in the wider community.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "title": "Trump impeachment: Key takeaways from second day of Senate trial",
      "tags": "US politics,United States Senate",
      "text": "On day two of Donald Trump's Senate trial, the prosecutors had the spotlight to themselves.\nThe House impeachment managers presented new video footage as evidence of the brutality of what happened during the Capitol riots.\nBut Democrats made Donald Trump's Senate trial about more than just the events in Washington on 6 January. \nThey prosecuted a case against the president's conduct - in tweets and speeches - before, during and after election night 2020.\nHere are some of the key takeaways.\nLead manager Jamie Raskin quickly picked up where he left off on Tuesday, using Trump's own words on the day of the Capitol insurrection to tie him to the unrest.\nTrump was no \"innocent bystander\" on 6 January, he said, he was the \"inciter-in-chief\". Over many months, Trump had \"praised, encouraged and cultivated violence\". \nThe Democratic congressman said Trump's \"remember this day forever\" tweet while the Capitol was being ransacked were not words of sadness, but of celebration. Accusing the former president of watching the chaos unfold on TV \"like a reality show\", he went on to say: \"This is a day that will live in disgrace in American history, unless you ask Donald Trump.\"\nAnd if the Senate doesn't convict Trump and prohibit him from holding office in the future, Raskin concluded, such violence will happen again.\nFrom here, the managers laid out the details of their case, including more videos and accounts. But Raskin set the stage.\nThe Democrats want the senators to pass judgement on whether a president can call into question American electoral processes the way Trump did.\nSuch actions, Congressman Joaquin Castro said in his presentation, are dangerous to a democracy.\nThis is going to put Trump's legal team in a delicate situation. \nThey have reportedly advised the former president that his best defence is to focus on the constitutionality of the trial and his freedom of speech, not to rehash arguments that the election was fixed. But the Democrats are using their time in front of the Senate to launch a full-bore attack against the president's claims. He may demand that his team have a response.\nThe move also may not sit well with some of the Republican senators - like Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas - who vocally supported Trump's election fraud claims. The Democrats were never going to win their support for conviction, but they might make them uneasy in their seats.\nSenator Hawley certainly didn't want to give the impression of feeling uncomfortable - he sat with his feet on a chair in the chamber's second-floor gallery. Meanwhile, Rand Paul of Kentucky was seen doodling on a notepad. \nThose were a few of the more visible indications that, for at least some of the senators sitting in judgement of the former president, the day's proceedings may not have much relevance.\nHawley and Paul were among the 44 Republicans who voted on Tuesday evening to dismiss the case against Trump as unconstitutional. Given that they believe the entire trial is illegitimate, it would stand to reason to think they have concluded that whatever happens over the next few days is irrelevant. And it only takes 34 Republicans sticking by Trump to assure that he will be found not guilty.\nThat must be at least a bit frustrating for the Democratic impeachment managers, who have at least so far constructed a meticulous, cohesive case against the president, while Trump's defenders largely stumbled through their one appearance.\nTo use a sports metaphor, the Democrats are playing a flawless game and their opponents are struggling, but when they look up at the scoreboard they're still losing.\nOn the same day that Twitter announced that its ban of Donald Trump's account was permanent and irreversible even if he were to win back the presidency in 2024, the former president's tweets took centre stage in his impeachment trial.\nJamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, once again displayed Trump's post-riot message that \"these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots\".\nAfter Raskin's opening statement, a series of impeachment managers spent large chunks of their presentations reading out Trump's tweets - prosecuting him with his own words.\nThere's a certain amount of irony in the fact that Trump's political rise was facilitated, in part, through his savvy use of social media to establish his unscripted authenticity, set the news cycle and bypass the filters of mainstream news. \nNow, weeks after his Twitter account has been shuttered, his tweets are Exhibit A to Z in an attempt to permanently end his political career.\nAfter hours of presentations on events leading up to 6 January, Delegate Stacey E Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands and Congressman Eric Swalwell of California walked through the attack on the US Capitol, minute by minute. \nUsing previously unreleased audio from police radios and video from Capitol security cameras, they recounted the violence as it unfolded, with the rioter's progress illustrated on a map of the US Capitol.\nThe House impeachment managers noted earlier in the day how close the rioters came to reaching US elected officials. The presentation drove that point home in painstaking detail.\nVideo showed Senator Mitt Romney turning and running in a Capitol hallway as a police officer warned him of the approaching mob. \nVice-President Mike Pence and his family were quickly ushered by the Secret Services from their hiding place near the Senate Floor. \nSenators hurried out of the building just 58 steps from the angry crowd, Swalwell noted.\nAides to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rushed to a conference room to barricade themselves in, just moments before a group of rioters entered the hallway and pounded on the doors. \nOne rioter wandered the Capitol, calling in an eerie sing-song voice: \"We're looking for you, Nancy.\"\n\"President Trump put a target on their backs, and his mob went into the Capitol to hunt them down,\" Plaskett said."

That means they have debts that are hard to manage, low savings, and are vulnerable to a financial shock such as a large, unexpected bill.\nThe number of people who fell into that category rose by 5.1 million between February and October.\nMany people have cut back on essentials, around a fifth expect to borrow from family and friends, and one in 10 plan to use a food bank.\n\"While there are some positives in the data, many of the findings are worrying,\" said Nisha Arora, director of consumer and retail Policy at the FCA.\n\"The pain is not being shared equally with a higher than average proportion of younger and BAME adults becoming vulnerable since March.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Asthma,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Asthma sufferers have called for clarity from government over \"confusion\" about whether they will be prioritised for the Covid vaccine.\nIt has confirmed the most severe cases who have been advised to shield will be prioritised for the jab by 15 February. \nAnd younger people requiring \"repeated or continuous\" use of oral steroids or with previous hospital admissions will be vaccinated ahead of their peers.\nThe NHS defined non-severe asthmatics as being at \"moderate risk\" from Covid.\nAsthma UK previously said it understood anyone using a steroid inhaler would be prioritised for a vaccine. \nA guide still on the government website also states the vaccine will be offered to \"adults with...breathing problems like asthma (use of steroid inhaler often)\".\nBut separately the government has said the priority groups for vaccination would include all those who need regular \"systemic\" steroids for asthma.\n\"Systemic\" steroids are nearly always in the form of tablets, though Asthma UK is still in the process of confirming whether priority six will include people using steroid inhalers. \nThe government said it was following independent experts' advice on how vaccines should be allocated.\nJames, a 37-year-old commercial manager from Chesterfield, said he had been left off the list despite suffering from both moderate asthma and having suffered a pulmonary embolism as a result of a rare blood clotting disorder that has caused lasting lung damage.\nHe believes he has \"fallen through the cracks\" despite vascular disease appearing on the priority list, leaving him feeling frustrated and forgotten. \nAnd Jeff Hunt, a 50-year-old from Somerset, said his moderate asthma had not required hospitalisation because he had been \"extremely cautious\" - but that didn't mean his condition didn't put him at risk. \n\"I'm really frustrated with the government guidance being so unclear,\" he said. \"It doesn't feel like it makes sense\".\n\"We're all being called for an annual flu jab but now we're being told we're at no greater risk than the average population,\" he added.\nMr Hunt criticised the lack of consistency in the guidance meaning some people were getting the jab while others on the same medication were not. \nOthers spoke of a lack of clarity over what \"severe asthma\" meant, and being made to feel \"troublesome\" or like they were trying to jump the queue when they enquired. \nThe nine priority groups are based on preventing deaths in the most vulnerable and protecting health and care staff. \nSince age is the biggest risk factor for Covid deaths, the first three groups are:\nGroup four covers people who are \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" - those who have received a letter advising them to shield. \nWhen it comes to asthma, the confusion has been around who falls into priority group six - those who are not formally shielding but are considered clinically \"at risk\".\nThat group should be vaccinated after healthy over-65s but before anyone younger than that without health conditions\nAnd for asthma it appears to have similar criteria to group four - those advised to shield - but the difference is likely to be in the dose of steroids taken or whether they are taking any other medications, such as ones which target antibodies in the blood to prevent inflammation.\nWell-controlled asthma that doesn't require oral steroids is not thought to increase someone's risk of dying from Covid.\nThis is based on the medical records of people with asthma who contracted Covid over the past year. \nIt is understood the government will aim to offer the jab to group six - and all over-50s - by May.   \nAnd the government aims to vaccinate everyone in the first four priority groups by mid-February.   \nAsthma UK and British Lung Foundation chief executive Sarah Woolnough said: \"We know that many people with asthma are confused about when they will get the vaccine and what priority group they fall into. \n\"We've been urging the government for some months to provide clarity on this, as we know it's a worrying time for lots of people.\n\"And we now have more information.\"\nBut, she added: \"It may be hard to accurately identify everyone in this [priority-six] group.\n\"The government should err on the side of caution in decision-making and cast its net wide when making decisions about definitions, to ensure that people with asthma who are at risk won't be missed.\" \nAs well as being an indicator of how severe someone's asthma is, steroids suppress the immune system, making it harder to fight off viruses. \nMs Woolnough said: \"Reassuringly, evidence now shows that people with well controlled asthma that is not severe don't seem to be at higher risk of dying from Covid-19.\"\nBut some people with asthma have expressed concerns online about their wider health including the risks of long Covid. \nNHS England said it would be offering vaccines based on the government's nine categories and patients' medical records. \nCLARIFICATION: The article previous stated all steroid-users would be prioritised and has been updated to reflect that only those using oral steroids have been confirmed. The BBC is seeking further clarification over inhaled steroids. "

      "tags": "Chemistry,Environment",
      "text": "A steady decline in the levels of ozone-harming CFC chemicals in the atmosphere has resumed, scientists say. \nThis follows a recent, dangerous pause in that downward trajectory, which could have slowed the healing of Earth's protective ozone layer.\nAtmospheric measurements published in 2018 pointed to illegal CFC production that was occurring in Eastern China. \nStopping that production appears to have set the ozone layer's healing process back on track. \nThe ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\nWhen it is depleted, more of this UV radiation can reach the surface - causing potential harm to humans and other living things.\nUltraviolet rays can damage DNA and cause sunburn, increasing the long-term risk of problems such as skin cancer.\nCFCs stand for chlorofluorocarbons. This family of chemicals has seen widespread use in refrigeration and as propellants in aerosol cans. Their role in destroying the ozone layer has been known since the 1980s.\nThe conclusions of a chemistry-based detective story, based on work carried out over several years by an international team of researchers, are published in two papers in the journal Nature. \nThe first paper reveals that global emissions - of one particular type of CFC, trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) - decreased in 2019 at a rate that is consistent with the global ban on CFC production. \nThat ban was put in place by the 1987 Montreal Protocol - an environmental treaty signed by almost every country that banned the production of these ozone-depleting chemicals from 2010.\u00a0\n\"Things seemed to be going to plan,\" explained Dr Luke\u00a0Western, an atmospheric scientist from the University of Bristol. \nBut in 2018, a study revealed that \"the concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere wasn't falling as quickly as we would expect\". \n\"That's where it all started - we wanted to know what was happening,\" said Dr Western. \"The work I was involved in showed that this [extra CFC-11] was primarily coming from East China.\"\nDr Western and his colleagues used data from air monitoring stations in South Korea and Japan.\nFurther detective work in China by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) - and by environmental journalists - found that the chemical was being used in the majority of polyurethane insulation foam that was being produced by firms in the region.\nThe scientists stressed that the scale of this illegal production may never be revealed in full. But this combination - of chemistry, investigative journalism and enforcement of the Montreal Protocol, the researchers say, has avoided significant delays to the healing of the ozone layer. \n\"First we noticed that the pollution spikes in the region were falling, so likely the nearby polluters were stopping, or at least reducing, their emissions.\n\"And then we saw that, in 2019, emissions had really fallen back to the levels we hadn't seen since before 2013, which is when we first saw this uptick.\"\nResearchers say the recovery of the ozone layer is now \"back on track\".\n\"So later this century we should see recovery of the ozone layer back to levels that we saw in 1980,\" Dr Western added. \nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "When dentist Andy Bates offered to help administer the coronavirus vaccine, he hadn't bargained for the \"overload of bureaucracy\" he says came his way.\nDr Bates, from North Yorkshire, is one of a number of health staff to criticise the paperwork needed to gain NHS approval to give the jabs.\nSome medics have been asked for proof they are trained in areas such as preventing radicalisation.\nThe PM said the health secretary would be \"taking steps\" to address the issue.\nAsked about reports potential volunteers were being deterred by the additional training and forms about \"de-radicalisation measures\" and \"fire drills\", Mr Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday: \"I think it's absurd and I know that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of that pointless bureaucracy.\" \nThe NHS has previously said training and checks were needed for vaccinators.\nDr Bates, a 56-year-old dentist based in Skipton, says he was met with layers of \"bureaucracy\" when he applied to be an NHS vaccinator - a paid role that requires healthcare experience.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I am a working dentist with a dental practice. I work four days a week which gives me a day off and the weekend, so I thought I could probably help out [with] explaining things to people, being able to use a needle, being able to relax people in an environment where you're giving them a jab.\n\"It's part and parcel of the job of being a dentist.\"\nBut he says he and two of his dental staff who also applied for roles have been asked to upload a \"huge list of documents\" and complete online modules proving they are trained in certain areas to progress their applications.\nRecognising and managing anaphylaxis\nResuscitation, level 2\nSafeguarding adults, level 2\nSafeguarding children, level 2\nVaccine administration\nVaccine storage\nHealth, Safety and Welfare, level 1\nInfection Prevention and control, level 2\nIntroduction to Anaphylaxis\nLegal aspects of vaccination\nMoving and Handling, level 1\nPreventing radicalisation, level 1\nConflict resolution, level 1\nCore knowledge for Covid-19 vaccinators\nCovid mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine)\nData security awareness, level 1\nEquality, Diversity and Human rights, level 1\nFire safety, level 1\nDr Bates says: \"Some of the things are really quite sensible - like resuscitation, and recognising and managing anaphylaxis - but then you get things like preventing radicalisation, level 1 certificate required [or] safeguarding children level 2.\"\n\"Children aren't a priority for vaccination, [so] I really don't think we're going to be seeing children.\"\nHe says in order to be a registered dentist and CQC registered dental practice, he already has to prove he has kept up his various trainings every year, but having to separate them out according to the NHS website's requirements \"would be really quite a task\".\n\"I must admit, I gave up at the second hurdle, because I'm very busy as a dentist and I do get home quite tired at night. I thought 'good grief, If I have to go through all this', I'm not [doing it].\"\nDr Bates believes that registered healthcare practitioners should be able to apply through their registration details, with a thorough identity check that would fast-track them through the necessary training.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and 944,539 people have had their first jab.\nThe prime minister told the BBC there would be 530,000 doses of the recently approved Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at 540 GP and 101 hospital vaccination sites on Monday, in addition to \"the million or so\" who have already been vaccinated.\nRevealing there were a \"few millions more\" Pfizer vaccine still be used, Mr Johnson told Andrew Marr the jabs were being rolled out \"as fast as we can\", saying the issue was not one of \"not so much one of distribution\",  and referred to concerns over the number of retired doctors to administer the jabs. \nDr Phil Clarke and wife Sheelagh, a nurse practitioner, retired from their local GP practice in Southampton two years ago. But when the pandemic struck in March and the government appealed for retired medics to help out, they answered the call and returned.\nSheelagh and Dr Clarke, both 67, say they have already been administering the Pfizer vaccine to the over-70s and 80s, care home residents and other vulnerable groups through their old practice.\nBut when the couple recently applied to become NHS vaccinators, Sheelagh says they feel that despite their skills and relevant experience, that the NHS was asking them to \"jump through 101 hoops\".\nShe told the BBC: \"You kind of feel like you're trusted and have quite major responsibility to go in and do vaccinating, and then a very belittling application tells you that they don't trust that you've got the skills and abilities to do it.\"\nShe said although they had done a lot of the required e-learning for their own practice, some of the other modules they'd been asked to do had left them \"flabbergasted\".\n\"We don't have time to do any more e-learning, we've already done a lot - probably about 10-12 hours- some of which are perfectly reasonable, like infection control, it's the unreasonable demands\" such as \"awareness of radicalisation and conflict resolution\". \nProf Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said recently retired medics and other healthcare professionals have \"huge amounts of skill and experience\" to offer the vaccine effort and called for \"bureaucratic barriers\" to be kept to \"the bare minimum\".\nHe added: \"Requiring people to submit more than 20 pieces of documentation, some of which have low relevance to the task they will be doing, and some of which some retired medics and returners to the profession won't even have, is a deterrent for them getting involved at a time when we need all hands on deck.\"\nAn NHS spokesman told the BBC on Saturday: \"Regardless of a person's background in healthcare, appropriate training and checks are necessary to handle the vaccine.\n\"[This] is why important processes are in place to make sure that former members of staff are up to speed on protocols and delivery, so that vaccinators are fully equipped with the skills to safely vaccinate patients in line with Public Health England standards.\"\nThe spokesman added that \"tens of thousands of people have already completed their online training\" which \"are being processed as quickly as possible and vaccinators will be deployed as and when they are required\".\nHe added: \"It is categorically untrue that there are any delays in Covid vaccination caused by accrediting volunteers or returners.\"\nThe UK plans to accelerate its vaccination rollout, amid a rise in coronavirus cases driven by a new variant of coronavirus, by giving both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs.\nPublic Health England (PHE) has clarified its guidance on second doses of the vaccine, after an article in the New York Times claimed there could be \"mixing and matching\" of the two different vaccines now authorised for use in the UK. \nDr Mary Ramsay, PHE's head of immunisations, said experts did \"not recommend mixing\" the jabs, but on the \"extremely rare occasions\" where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is \"better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all\"."

      "tags": "Amsterdam,UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "Amsterdam ousted London as the largest financial trading centre in Europe last month as Brexit-related changes to finance rules came into force.\nAbout \u20ac9.2bn (\u00a38.1bn) worth of shares were traded on Amsterdam exchanges each day, against \u20ac8.6bn in London.\nFollowing new Brexit rules, EU-based banks wanting to buy European shares currently cannot trade via London, meaning a loss of fees for City firms.\nBank of England chief Andrew Bailey has warned the EU not to cut off London.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Bailey said there were signs that the EU planned to cut the UK off from its financial markets.\nFollowing the new Brexit trading rules coming into effect, there are talks to harmonise rules over financial regulations - so-called equivalence \nBoth sides are working towards a March deadline to agree an \"equivalence\" regime under which the UK and Europe would recognise the other's regulations.\nNumber 10, said it remained \"open\" to discussions with the EU on the equivalence issue.\n\"Despite the fact that we've supplied all of the necessary paperwork and are one of the world's most preeminent financial centres, with a strong regulatory system, the EU still haven't granted us full equivalence.\"\n\"This has meant that some EU shares that were previously traded on UK venues have moved to the EU venues on advice of the European regulator, but our position is fragmentation of share trading across financial centres is in no one's interest,\" it added.\nIt's called invisible trade - but selling services abroad is something the UK excels in, particularly when it comes to banking. \nFinancial services makes up about 7% of the UK's income in total, and about 40% of banking and investment's business abroad is with the EU.\nBut its needs were largely invisible from the deal struck with the EU at the end of last year. The diversion of share trading is the first visible, if inevitable, sign of the impact. \nAnd that business may not return to London. Even if the UK government and Brussels can ultimately reach agreement that financial services can get more access to each others markets, on the basis the UK's standards can be deemed \"equivalent\" to the EU's, share dealing may not be part of that. \nThe UK government hopes Brexit will enhance the City's dominance, with scope to deepen relationships with other financial centres. But that's a work in progress. \nThe boss of one share exchange described a recently-struck deal that allows Swiss shares to be traded in London as being like a free kick in a football match rather than an equaliser: it doesn't compensate for what has been lost in loosening ties with Europe. \nMr Bailey said the City wanted to reach an agreement on financial rules, but would not accept being \"dictated\" to by Brussels. He said EU demands had so far been unreasonable.\n\"I'm afraid a world in which the EU dictates and determines which rules and standards we have in the UK isn't going to work,\" the governor said in his annual Mansion House speech to the City, this year held virtually. \n\"Is the EU going to cut the UK off from itself? There are signs of an intention to do so at the moment but I think that would be a mistake,\" he added.\n\"We have to state the argument for global standards and markets and openness and if we all sign up to that then there's no need to go in that direction.\"\nFinancial services - a key driver of the UK economy - were largely omitted from the last-minute Brexit trade deal agreed in December. \nThe City generates about \u00a3135bn in business annually, with financial institutions earning big fees from trading stocks and shares. But London's financial centre has been cut off from EU markets since 1 January.\nBut Brussels says it will not be rushed into decisions on granting access for UK financial firms, as it wants to see how far UK rules will diverge from its own.\nIt follows fears the UK will adopt a low-regulation Singapore-style model that would undercut the EU.\nMr Bailey said the EU was holding the UK to unrealistically high standards on the issue of divergence, saying it would in effect make the City a \"rule taker\".\nHe added that while some UK rules would change post-Brexit, sudden deregulation was not on the cards. \n\"Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low-regulation, high-risk, anything-goes financial centre and system,\" he said.\n\"We have an overwhelming body of evidence that such an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else's.\"\nDespite the current situation, Mr Bailey said that London would \"undoubtedly continue as one of the world's leading if not the leading financial centre\".\nLast month Mr Bailey said up to 7,000 finance jobs had so far been relocated from London to rival centres in the EU - well down on predictions of as many as 50,000 losses."

      "text": "The Met Office says an overnight temperature of -23C (-9.4F) recorded in Scotland is the lowest in more than 25 years.\nBBC weather presenter Simon King described the temperatures in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, as \"incredible\".\nIt was the lowest February temperature since 1955, and the UK's coldest night since 30 December 1995.\nA Met Office yellow snow and ice warning is in place for large parts of the country until 12:00 on Friday.\nScotRail said the winter weather was causing major problems for its services on Thursday morning.\nMr King said cold air from Siberia and the Arctic - known as the Beast from the East - had sent temperatures \"plummeting\" over the last week.\n\"While we've all experienced the cold wind, it's over the last couple of nights the temperature has got really low, especially in northern Scotland,\" he said.\n\"There are three reasons for this: thick snow on the ground, clear skies and light winds.\"\nHe said that a covering of snow traps the warmth in the ground.\n\"So when night falls, where the ground would normally radiate heat to the air, that heat can't get out so the air temperature is lower,\" he explained.\n\"If skies are clear, any heat that does get out of the ground, escapes into space.\n\"Wind normally mixes the air close to the surface, so at night it'll mix the warmth coming from the ground and keep temperatures up. When the wind is light and there's no warmth from the ground, the temperature can fall to levels you normally find in your freezer. Just like we've seen in northern Scotland.\"\nMalcolm MacIntyre, of the Braemar Mountain Rescue Team, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: \"It is a beautiful morning actually and it is really cold.\n\"The snow is squeaky, which always signifies that it is really cold.\n\"But in some ways once it gets below about minus 10/12, as long as it is not windy, it just feels really crisp and clear.\" \nScottish Water said it was dealing with double the normal number of burst pipes for the time of year as temperatures plunged.\nHundreds of burst pipes have been reported in the past week.\nAbout 29,000 properties were left without water on Wednesday night in the east end of Glasgow after a mains pipe burst.\nScottish Water has also brought in divers to break up ice in reservoirs at Stornoway on Lewis and Kinlochbervie in the Highlands. The build-up of ice was affecting supplies.\nThe company said it had not previously used so many divers in a such a short period of time.\nPolice in Tayside charged a man with dangerous driving after being stopped in Dundee with snow covering almost his entire front and rear windscreens.\nThey said it was \"about the most extreme example of lack of preparation\" that they had ever seen.\nOfficers said the man had been driving with \"practically zero-visibility\" when stopped.\nIn stark contrast, firefighters worked through the night to tackle a large wildfire in the Western Isles.\nThe blaze on Benbecula was reported at 15:30 on Wednesday and extended across about 1km at its height.\nTraffic Scotland urged drivers not to leave home unless it is essential and ScotRail is encouraging people to check their journey before leaving the house.\nThe operator tweeted: \"We're currently seeing severe disruption across the network, particularly in the Central Belt with disruption affecting services to/from Glasgow Queen Street High Level and Edinburgh Waverley.\"\nOn Tuesday heavy snowfall caused widespread disruption across Scotland."

      "text": "Not enough is known about how much children and young people are at risk online in Northern Ireland.\nThat is according to a new online safety strategy for young people published by the Northern Ireland Executive.\nIt said more research and data collection was needed to understand the scale of the problem.\nThe strategy also said that a lot of restrictions on online access for children were \"outdated\".\nIn 2018, BBC News NI revealed that publication of the strategy had been delayed due to the collapse of the executive for three years and the lack of a health minister.\nThe National Children's Bureau had expressed concerns that children's online safety was being put at risk by the delay.\nAccording to the just published document, the strategy aims to support and empower \"children and young people to engage in online activities in an educated, safe, responsible and respectful way\".\nIt said that while the online world had \"opened up a new level of opportunity for children and young people\", there were a number of risks to their safety.\nThese included exposure to pornography, abuse or information encouraging suicide or self-harm.\nThey were also at risk of things like grooming, harassment, sexting or cyberbullying.\nSome young people who took part in a consultation for the strategy, however, felt their parents \"over-exaggerated\" the dangers.\n\"Parents are nervous as they don't know too much about [the internet] and because there has been a lot of stories like cyber-bullying,\" one said.\nHowever, young people said that if they had concerns, they wanted them to be taken seriously.\nBut some teachers quoted in the document said there was \"pretty much nothing in place\" in their school to help children online.\n\"It is just a box-ticking exercise, it is just paperwork,\" one said.\n\"We tend to be reactive to specific issues so at the moment there would be huge things in our school around Snapchat,\" another said.\n\"But we are never prepared for it - it is always after the event, unfortunately.\" \nThe strategy document said there were a number of gaps in current information about online safety.\n\"Outside of official crime statistics, there is little regular data collected on either the scale of online-safety related incidents happening across NI, nor of the particular issues and concerns facing children, young people and parents or carers on a regular basis,\" it said.\n\"It is important to remember that the incidents which make the headlines, or appear as crime statistics are the exception; we know little about the everyday online safety needs of children and young people.\"\nIt said more research and data collection was needed.\nParents and young people also said while there were some excellent resources, a single website on online safety and a more \"joined-up\" approach were needed.\n\"A central repository of online safety information, support and guidance is needed to support dissemination of consistent messaging to children and young people, parents/carers, practitioners, policy makers and the wider public,\" the document said.\nIt said that not all schools took a consistent approach to the risks to pupils online.\nSome had, for instance, installed additional wifi which could enable pupils to access websites which could put them at risk.\nThe strategy said a common approach to educating children and their parents and carers was needed, as well as more accredited training in online safety.\nIt also made a number of other commitments to lower the online risks to children and young people.\nAn action plan has been developed to support the strategy, which will be co-ordinated by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Holidays,Travel,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"too early\" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead, the health secretary has said.\nMatt Hancock said there was still \"a lot of uncertainty\" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year.\nHe told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall \"months ago\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to \"get rid of the mixed messages\" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year.\nSome Tory MPs and businesses also criticised the government for fuelling uncertainty for travel companies already struggling in the pandemic.\nIt follows confusion after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned \"people shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally\".\nDowning Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February.\nAnalysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake\nFor most announcements from the government, a day here or there might not make much difference. \nBut nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised \"roadmap\" to take England out of lockdown. \nSo when the prime minister promised that \"on 22 February\" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries. \nBut now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come \"on the week of the 22nd\" - which isn't quite the same. \nIn response, Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to \"backslide\" on its promise. \nThey want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March. \nA vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible. \nOthers have been more patient and kept faith the government will take the right decisions at the right time. \nBut the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow. \nMr Hancock told BBC Breakfast it was too early to know which coronavirus restrictions may still be in place over the summer, but that he understood people wanted to make plans.\n\"People are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday\", he said, but \"pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty\".\n\"We are doing everything that we possibly can to make sure that people can have a holiday this summer but the vaccine rollout is absolutely essential to that,\" he continued.\nThe health secretary also said that, before summer holidays, the priority would be making sure people can see loved ones again - but it was too early to say when this might happen.\nThe latest government figures show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 from Wednesday.\nThe UK also reported another 678 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, along with a further 13,494 new daily cases.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still \"incredibly high\". \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it \"doesn't make any sense\" to set out plans to ease restrictions with arbitrary dates in March or April, adding that \"the data has to drive us\".\n\"In 2020 we lifted restrictions too quickly... as a result the transmission went back up in this country,\" he said.\nDawn Dillon, from Surrey, says her husband booked a holiday to Spain in June 2019 for the following year as her birthday present.\nThey were able to move the trip, which cost \u00a31,000 for accommodation and flights, from 2020 to June 2021.\n\"But what do we do now - will we lose our holiday?\" she asks. \n\"I know it's not a priority but it would be nice to have some clarity.\"\nDawn, who is 55 and asthmatic, says she had anticipated that she would have had a Covid vaccine, along with her husband, before the trip in June.\n\"But you don't know how advanced the vaccination process is in other countries,\" she adds.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that as far as holidays were concerned, people would have to be a \"little bit more patient\".\nThe PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson does not have a holiday planned but \"is obviously keen to have a break over the summer\".\nBut Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised ministers for not being clearer about what the public could plan for.\nHe said he had yet to book a holiday because he was \"in the same boat as everyone else\".\nSir Keir said he had a \"holding\" booking for a break in Devon in August that is \"subject to restrictions, that's the best anybody can do\".\nSenior Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker accused ministers of \"ripping out\" the goalposts on the timetable for lifting Covid restrictions.\nPeople \"need to have something to look forward to\", he said.\nOne travel industry leader criticised the government's plea for people to stop making summer plans as \"puerile and nonsensical\".\nAnd Heathrow Airport's chief executive said getting back to normality was not just about people's holidays but also to \"protect people's businesses and livelihood\".\nMeanwhile, Henry Joce, of Tencreek Holiday Park and Campsite in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5 Live it may be too late, not too soon, to book a spot there over certain dates this summer. \nHe said soaring demand for breaks over the past fortnight meant he was at risk of selling out during peak weeks, which he put down to people \"being desperate to get away\".\nUnder the current national restrictions, holidays are not permitted anywhere in the UK. International travel is restricted to essential purposes, such as for work, medical appointments, or education.\nA new online portal allowing UK and Irish nationals and residents travelling from certain \"red list\" countries to book a place in hotel quarantine had technical issues as it launched on Thursday.\nFrom Monday, arrivals from 33 nations deemed high-risk due to new virus variants must isolate for 10 days in managed facilities at a cost of at least \u00a31,750. \nAll other arrivals must see out a 10-day quarantine at home, but will be required to pay \u00a3210 for two additional private virus tests booked prior to arrival.\nHave you planned a holiday for this year? Are you returning to the UK soon and will be staying at a quarantine hotel? Please share your experiences."

      "text": "Musicians have reacted angrily to the removal of a graffiti marriage proposal painted almost 20 years ago.\nThe 'I Love You Will U Marry Me' message had remained on Sheffield's Park Hill flats since 2001.\nSinger Richard Hawley, a well-known son of the Steel City, said he was \"really angry\" and called for the symbol of his hometown to be reinstated.\nPulp drummer Nick Banks and singer Yungblud also said they were \"dismayed\" and \"heartbroken\".\nThe graffiti was painted by Jason Lowe in a bid to woo his then-girlfriend and was later immortalised in neon lights as part of a marketing campaign.\nDevelopers Urban Splash said the message - on a bridge linking two blocks of flats - had been removed to allow for \"essential repair work\".\nHawley told BBC Radio 4: \"Like all graffiti, it's sometimes just some kind of nuisance, but it symbolises a state of mind in Sheffield.\n\"When I first found out about this I was, probably like a lot of Sheffielders, really, really angry.\"\nHawley, who wrote songs for a 2019 musical about the Park Hill estate, added: \"I just hope and would urge Urban Splash to put at least the fluorescent signs back.\n\"The people of Sheffield love it and that's the bottom line really.\"\nBanks said the graffiti had become \"almost a message to Sheffield itself, overlooking the city\".\n\"Put the neon sign back, yes, but it kind of loses something without the graffiti underneath.\"\nMeanwhile, Yungblud, real name Dominic Harrison, from Doncaster, tweeted to say he was \"heartbroken\".\nHe described the graffiti as \"a quirky act of romance\" in his song I Love You, Will You Marry Me.\nSurriya Falconer, speaking on behalf of the developers, said there were \"some structural issues\" which meant the words had to be removed but there were plans to replace them.\nAlthough Mr Lowe and his girlfriend never married, his romantic gesture has formed part of the city's skyline since, with many considering it an \"iconic\" piece of history. \nIn a BBC radio documentary, Mr Lowe explained how he braved his fear of heights to make a public show of proposing to Ms Middleton, who he had had been dating for a year.\nHe said: \"You used to be able to see it from the Odeon cinema.\n\"I took her there, she thought she was going to see a film and I said: 'I've got something to show you'. I told her to look up and she read it.\n\"She said 'yeah'. She thought I was mad.\"\nThe pair split up three months later and Ms Middleton died in 2007 from cancer. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Toxic air puts six million at risk of lung damage",
      "tags": "UK air pollution,Air pollution",
      "text": "About six million people aged over 65 in England are at high risk of lung damage and asthma attacks because of toxic air, according to a new report. \nIt finds that older people and those with lung disease who are most vulnerable to the effects of pollution are often the most exposed. \nThe new document is from the British Lung Foundation (BLF) and Asthma UK. \nIt comes as MPs also demand the government sets tougher targets for air pollution.\nImproving air quality needs to be \"at the core\" of the UK's post-pandemic rebuild, say members of a House of Commons committee that focuses on environmental issues.\nThe new report by two of the UK's leading respiratory charities finds that a quarter of all care homes and a third of all GP practices and hospitals in England are in places where particulate pollution exceeds the limits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), according to the new report.\nThe focus is on exposure to fine particulate matter.\nThis consists of tiny particles known as PM2.5s which have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres across - that is one-four-hundredth of a millimetre, or about 3% of the diameter of a human hair.\nPM2.5 particles are so small they can lodge in the lungs and even pass into the bloodstream. There's evidence they can damage blood vessels and other organs. \nParticulate pollution affects us all, but older people are more likely to suffer lung disease or have weakened lungs from aging.\nThere are no safe limits for PM2.5s, but the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that concentrations should not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic metre. \nThe BLF and Asthma UK report used data on PM2.5s collected in 2019. They found air pollution blackspots across the country that affected care homes. \nIn 36 local authorities, every single care home is located in areas with PM2.5 levels above the limits recommended by the WHO. These include Epping Forrest, Luton, Thurrock, Reading, Slough, Spelthorne, Broxbourne, Dartford and Watford.\nAir pollution is a major health issue in the UK, says Dr Nick Hopkinson, the medical director of the BLF.\nHe estimates that between 30,000 and 40,000 premature deaths each year are caused by exposure to toxic air. \nAir pollution also increases the chances of a person developing lung cancer and cardiovascular disease and may be associated with cognitive decline, including dementia.\n\"We know that older people are more likely to be exposed to particulates and we know that air quality is worse where poor people live\", Dr Hopkinson told BBC News.\nIt also found that 3,000 hospitals and GP practices are in areas where particulate pollution exceeds WHO recommended levels.\nThe current legal limit for PM2.5 in the UK is twice the WHO recommendation, at 20 micrograms per cubic metre.\nThe BLF and Asthma UK are demanding the government reduce that to the 10 micrograms per cubic metres limit recommended by the WHO.\nThe advice has been echoed by the Commons environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee.\nThe charities behind the report are also calling for the government to appoint a minister with specific responsibility for improving air quality in the UK and to publish a national health protection plan to safeguard those most at risk from toxic air. \nKimberlee Cole from Eastbourne is one of those people. \nShe has a lung condition called bronchiectasis, which is exacerbated by air pollution. \nHer lungs are so sensitive she can tell how polluted it is just by breathing in the air when she opens the door in the morning.\nWhen the particulate count is high, it irritates her lungs, making them produce excess mucus which leads to violent coughing fits that can last hours.\n\"Sometimes my lungs actually bleed\", Kim says. \"Sometimes it can be so bad I'm actually sick because of the coughing.\"\nResponding to the report, Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: \"Air pollution has reduced significantly since 2010 with emissions of fine particulate matter falling by 9% and emissions of nitrogen oxides are at their lowest level since records began. However, we know there is more to do.\n\"Our landmark Environment Bill will set at least two ambitious legally-binding air quality targets, with a primary focus on reducing exposure to particulate matter pollution. As part of this, we will consider the World Health Organization's guidelines for PM2.5.\n\"PHE (Public Health England) also continues to support health professionals improve our understanding of links between air pollution and health, including working with the National Institute for Care Excellence to develop guidelines and standards to better protect vulnerable people from air pollution.\" \nAlastair Lewis, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York, welcomed the report's focus on the impact of air pollution on vulnerable communities.\n\"The largest inequalities arise based on issues like health and deprivation and deprived communities typically have the worst air quality,\" he says.\nHowever, he cautions that the figures for particulate pollution in the report are based on atmospheric models, rather than measurements made on the ground.\nHe also points out that much of the PM2.5 in the atmosphere is often formed in the atmosphere by chemical reactions of other gases. \nThese gases move between regions and even between countries so there may not be a local solution to the problem. \nDr Heather Walton, an expert in air pollution from Imperial College London, also welcomed the findings. She told BBC News: \"The summary of the health evidence is well balanced and the modelling used is a standard model used by Defra.\"\nShe said the WHO guidelines provided a useful focus, but added: \"Nonetheless, it is important to note that health effects continue down to concentrations below the WHO guidelines and so it is always beneficial to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in whatever way possible.\"\nFollow Justin on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,United States Capitol,Donald Trump",
      "text": "Senators at Donald Trump's second impeachment trial have been shown new dramatic and graphic video of the day his supporters stormed the US Congress.\nThe footage showed police engaging in hand-to-hand clashes with rioters and desperately pleading for support.\nOfficers ushered politicians to safety, sometimes within metres of the mob breaking into the chambers.\nUsing Mr Trump's own words and tweets, Democrats prosecuting the case argued he had acted as \"inciter in chief\".\nA two-thirds majority is required to convict Mr Trump in the evenly split 100-seat Senate, but an acquittal looks likely as the vast majority of Republican senators have remained loyal to him so far.\nHowever, if convicted, he could be barred from holding office again.\nIn at times emotional testimony, impeachment managers - the Democrats tasked with leading the prosecution - methodically pieced together the 6 January attack on the Capitol.\nThe building was stormed after thousands gathered in support of false claims that widespread fraud denied Mr Trump victory in the November presidential election. Five people died, including a Capitol police officer.\nThe previously unreleased security footage revealed how rioters, including some in body armour, violently breached the building and sought out those who had gathered to certify the election result.\nIn frenzied audio, security officials were heard describing how crowds were using weapons like bats and tear gas against them.\nIn one clip, Republican senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney was seen walking towards the rioters before being ushered to safety by Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman.\nAnother video showed Vice-President Mike Pence and his family being evacuated amid chants by some in the crowd to \"hang\" him for refusing to object to certifying the result.\nIn another sequence, staffers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were heard whispering in hiding as rioters breached her office and called out: \"Where are you, Nancy\".\nGraphic mobile phone footage showed a Trump supporter being shot dead as she tried to enter the House of Representatives' lobby and another video showed a riot police officer screaming out in pain as he was crushed in a doorway by the mob.\nSenators sat through the first day of evidence with lead prosecution manager Jamie Raskin arguing Mr Trump was no \"innocent bystander\" to the violence having \"praised, encouraged and cultivated\" it for months.\nDelegate Stacey Plaskett, presenting evidence, argued that the former president had \"deliberately encouraged\" the violence and \"put a target on the backs\" of senior figures,  including his own vice-president. \nImpeachment managers used social media posts and clips of Mr Trump to illustrate how he spent weeks pushing a \"big lie\" that the election had been stolen from him, and with his reaction to the attack.\nThey forensically dissected footage of the speech the former president gave just hours before the attack, in which he told the crowd to \"fight like hell\". The managers said Mr Trump used the rally to \"inflame\" supporters further before directing them to march to the Capitol. \nScreenshots from pro-Trump websites were shown as evidence that radicals in his support base were emboldened by his rhetoric to pre-plan the attack and spoke openly about their ambitions for violence against lawmakers.\nThose arguing the case repeatedly appealed to the emotions of senators, who act as jurors in the case, about their own experiences on the day. \"You were just 58 steps away from where the mob was amassing,\" Congressman Eric Swalwell told them.\n\"These attackers stood right where you are... They desecrated this place and literally the president sat delighted, doing nothing to help us,\" Representative David Cicilline said, telling Republicans: \"We have to make this right, and you can make it right.\"\nImpeachment managers also focused on Mr Trump's failure to condemn and call off his supporters as the violence unfolded. \"President Trump left everyone in this Capitol for dead,\" Representative Joaquin Castro said.\nDespite the strong footage, several Republican senators said they had not changed their minds. \"[Mr Trump] bears some responsibility for what happened that day, but... that doesn't mean that impeachment is the right way to address it,\" said Senator Marco Rubio.\nDemocrats will continue to argue their case for conviction on Thursday, before Mr Trump's team take to the stand in his defence. They have already argued the trial is politically motivated and unconstitutional and that he did not encourage violence.\nArguments are expected to run through until the weekend when senators will get a chance to ask questions.\nIt is unclear if the impeachment managers will then extend the timetable by requesting witnesses be called or ordered to testify - or subpoenaed. Mr Trump has already declined to voluntarily testify.\nLawmakers on both sides are said to favour a quick trial and a Senate vote on whether to acquit or convict Mr Trump could be held early next week.\nOnly six Republicans voted that the trial was constitutional earlier this week, far short of the 17 that would be required to vote with Democrats to achieve a conviction in the final vote.

      "tags": "Dexamethasone,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A drug normally used to treat arthritis can be a life-saver for some of the sickest hospital patients with Covid, new research shows.\nFor every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, along with a cheap steroid already routinely given, an additional life would be saved, the experts say.\nSome hospitals are now doing this. \nAs well as improving survival and recovery time, it can avoid patients needing to be moved to intensive care, say the NHS doctors.\nWendy Coleman, 62, received the treatment last year when she was admitted to Chesterfield Royal Hospital with severe Covid-19.\n\"I was struggling to breathe quite badly and on the verge of being placed in an intensive care unit. \n\"After I was given tocilizumab, my condition stabilised and I didn't get any worse. Up until then, it was quite scary as I didn't know if I was going to make it or not,\" she said. \nResearchers say around half of people admitted to hospital with Covid could benefit from the treatment. \nThey have carried out a clinical trial with more than 4,000 volunteers, like Wendy, and say the results are \"tremendous\". \nHalf of these Covid patients were given tocilizumab, via a drip, alongside usual care with a life-saving cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. \nIn that group, compared to another group that did not receive the new drug: \nCombined, tocilizumab and dexamethasone should cut death risk by about a third for patients on oxygen and halve it for those on a ventilator, the researchers say. \nProf Martin Landray, joint chief investigator of the RECOVERY trial and a medical expert at Oxford University, said: \"Used in combination, the impact is substantial. This is good news for patients and good news for the health services that care for them in the UK and around the world.\" \nDr Charlotte Summers, an intensive care medic at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said: \"These findings are a tremendous step forwards. This therapy looks like it keeps people out of the intensive care unit so they never need to see people like me which can only be a good thing.\"\nThe treatment isn't cheap, costing around \u00a3500 per patient on top of the \u00a35 course of dexamethasone. But the advantage of using it is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around \u00a32,000.\nThe drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs.\nThe preliminary trial results will soon be submitted to a peer-reviewed medical journal. \nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"We are working quickly and closely with colleagues across the health system and sector to ensure every NHS patient who needs this treatment should be able to access it - reducing further pressures on the NHS and potentially saving thousands of lives.\"\nNHS national medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it was another breakthrough in the fight against coronavirus.

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Robert Jenrick,UK fire safety",
      "text": "Campaigners have said the government's promise of \u00a33.5bn of extra funding to remove unsafe cladding from England's high-rises is \"too little, too late\".\nThe government said flammable materials would be removed from buildings over 18m high \"at no cost to residents\".\nBut Labour said the \"arbitrary\" height limit could result in financial ruin for many in lower blocks, who would be offered loans to make their home safe.\nAfter 2017's Grenfell disaster, many tower blocks were found to be unsafe.\nThis meant many thousands of flat-owners have since faced huge bills for fire-safety improvements, brought in after the devastating tower block fire when flames spread via combustible cladding, killing 72 people.\nThe Grenfell United campaign group said the latest measures were \"too little, too late\", and it needed the mess dealt with \"once and for all\".\n\"Residents living in unsafe homes will go to bed tonight worrying if their building will qualify or be left out once again. And bereaved and survivors of Grenfell will lay awake fearful that what happened to us could still happen again,\" the group said.\nIn the Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also announced:\nThe \u00a33.5bn comes on top of \u00a31.6bn in funding that was announced for the removal of unsafe cladding last year.\nMinisters have come under growing pressure to increase the pot as leaseholders have been hit by building improvement costs and soaring insurance costs.\nSome say they have effectively become trapped in their own homes - unable to sell until the work is carried out, yet in danger of bankrupting themselves to meet the costs.\nStephen Squires, who lives in a 22-storey block in Manchester, told the PA Media news agency he and others were \"still stuck in limbo\", even after the announcement.\nThe government had consistently failed to acknowledge the issues were far wider reaching than cladding, he said, and they still did not know whether fire safety defects would be covered by the funding.\nMr Jenrick told MPs that leaseholders in high-rise buildings above 18m, or with six storeys or more, would face no costs for cladding works. \nHe said the risk was \"significantly lower\" for lower-rise blocks of flats. \nHowever, for anyone living with dangerous cladding in such flats, a loan scheme would be set up to protect leaseholders so none of them would pay more than \u00a350 a month for the removal of unsafe cladding.\nIt \"cannot be right the costs fall solely on tax payers\", he said, adding that the government would develop a levy targeted at developers seeking to build certain high-rise buildings in England. \nHe also said a new tax for the UK residential property sector would be introduced from next year, to raise \u00a32bn over a decade and help pay for the removal of cladding.\nMr Jenrick described the action as an \"unprecedented intervention\" without which building owners would simply pass on the costs of remediation work to leaseholders.\n\"That would risk punishing those who have worked hard, who have bought their own home, but through no fault of their own have found themselves caught in an absolutely invidious situation,\" he said.\nThe Home Builders Federation, a trade association for private sector homebuilders, said it supported \"sensible\" solutions for recouping costs and was looking forward to working with the government on an \"equitable\" tax that did not \"threaten housing supply\".\nMatt Browne and Lizzie Bennett are among thousands of flat-owners who discovered in the last year they lived in a dangerous block.\nTheir Birmingham city centre building measures 18.2 metres - so just qualifies for the funding promised today. \nMatt, a 26-year-old video producer, says although he is relieved, he feels \"incredibly sorry\" for those whose homes don't meet that threshold.\n\"[That] could have been ours if our building was one brick lower. That's literally the difference we're talking about,\" he says.\nHe says leaseholders feel \"betrayed\" because the government has said \"multiple times\" they should not pay. \n\"Then all of a sudden today it's like, 'right, leaseholders are going to pay \u00a350 a month,'\" he says.\nThe couple say they have been hit with a \u00a350,000 bill after their block failed an external wall fire review. \nThat covers not only the removal of unsafe cladding, but also works relating to other things found in the review like missing fire cavity barriers. \nMatt is now concerned the government fund only covers the cladding removal. \"There are still costs in there which are going to cost thousands and thousands of pounds, which is money we don't have,\" he says.\nAround 100 miles away in east London, solicitor Peter Tolson lives in a building that also qualifies for the extra cash, but says the announcement \"doesn't make a huge amount of difference\" to him and his fellow residents.\nHe helps run his block's management company, and says they began the initial process to prove their eligibility for the fund last spring. But they haven't received funds, he says.\n\"We're just trying to pass every barrier and get access to the funds, which we're finding harder and harder,\" he adds.\nConservative MP Stephen McPartland, a critic of the government's handling of the cladding crisis, said Mr Jenrick's announcement did not go far enough and the issue was much bigger than the matter of cladding.\n\"The support he has offered does not help most people because people who've got excessive insurance premiums, fire safety defects - that's where the real costs are,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.\n\"Leaseholders are the innocent parties in this. Many people were in primary school when these buildings were constructed and they're now being hit with bills that will be bankrupting them.\"\nLabour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, called the proposals \"an injustice\" that would \"pile financial misery\" on homeowners.\nShe said there were many questions left unanswered, including on \"skyrocketing\" insurance costs, homes potentially remaining \"unsellable\", and the amount leaseholders would be expected to pay. \nThe \"arbitrary 18m-height limit\" could \"mean the difference between a safe home and financial ruin\", she said.\nLabour wants an independent taskforce to be established to take the matter out of politicians' hands and ensure funds are distributed fairly.\nBy Sarah Corker, BBC consumer affairs correspondent\nThe question of who should pay to fix fire safety faults - government, developers, building owners or leaseholders - is at the heart of resolving this crisis. \nWhile cladding campaigners have welcomed the extra government funding, they say an additional \u00a33.5bn is not enough given the scale of the problems. \nTo force the building industry to contribute, the government will introduce a levy on developers which build future high-rises. A move broadly welcomed, but it will take years to build up a pot of money. \nWhat started as a cladding scandal has become a much wider building safety crisis. \nIn the wake of the Grenfell tower tragedy, safety inspections on thousands of high rise blocks have exposed not just dangerous cladding but other fire safety problems including defective insulation, missing fire breaks and timber balconies. \nCurrently there is no government money to fix non-cladding faults.\nRebecca Fairclough, from Manchester Cladiators, which represents 70 tower blocks with fire safety issues in the Greater Manchester area, said funding was needed to cover all building safety issues, not just cladding.\nShe said she was disappointed loans were the only solution on offer to those in buildings under 18m high.\n\"Millions of residents continue to live in dangerous buildings, facing impossible bills and with their mental health deteriorating daily,\" she said. \nNatasha Letchford, a campaigner for the End Our Cladding Scandal group, said the funding was far short of the estimated \u00a315bn bill to fix all the issues.\nShe said as long as there were outstanding bills on properties, they would be worthless and people simply would not want to buy them. \nThe government said the spending funded by the UK-wide tax would be subject to the Barnett formula. This means Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding, which can be spent as the devolved administrations see fit, including on building safety. "

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has denied breaching the ministerial code by meeting Alex Salmond while claims against him were being investigated by her government.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said there was a \"cover up at the heart of government\" over the row.\nBut the first minister said she would rebut \"ridiculous conspiracy theories\" when she faces a Holyrood inquiry.\nAnd she hinted that the committee should use its powers to compel her predecessor, Mr Salmond, to appear too.\nThe former first minister is now not expected to give oral evidence after the committee said he had set conditions they \"simply could never meet\".\nThe Holyrood inquiry was set up after the government admitted its investigation of two internal harassment complaints against Mr Salmond had been \"unlawful\", and agreed to pay him \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses.\nMs Sturgeon also commissioned an independent review of whether or not she broke the ministerial code in her dealings with her former mentor during the process, with both probes expected to report back in the coming months.\nMs Davidson said the first minister had \"chosen not to tell officials in advance and not keep a record\" of the meetings with Mr Salmond, and said she had told MSPs \"things that are utterly contradicted by her own evidence and testimony\".\nShe added: \"We have failed women, taxpayers money and a cover up at the heart of government - this whole affair stinks to high heaven.\"\nMs Sturgeon, who is expected to finally give evidence to the committee next week after the session was repeatedly postponed, said she was \"relishing\" the prospect.\nShe said: \"I certainly hope to be sitting in front of the committee answering all of these questions on oath next Tuesday morning, and people can listen to that and make up their own minds.\n\"I believe it is important to subject myself to scrutiny, but also to have the opportunity to take head on some of the ridiculous conspiracy theories that people like Ruth Davidson have been all too quick to want to indulge.\"\nMs Sturgeon was also pressed by Scottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie, who said ministers who knowingly mislead parliament are expected to resign.\nShe asked Ms Sturgeon whether she would quit if she was found to have breached the code - but  the first minister said she would not engage with the \"hypothetical\" question.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"I do not consider that I breached the ministerial code - I will make that case very, very robustly.\n\"I know why the opposition are desperate to get rid of me, I'm under no illusions about that. But I like everyone else am entitled to due process.\"\nMs Sturgeon also hinted that the inquiry committee should use Holyrood's powers to compel Mr Salmond to appear, saying it should not \"indulge conspiracy theories without insisting people come before the committee to substantiate those theories\".\nShe said: \"I still hope the committee will perhaps use the powers that are available to it to make sure everybody relevant sits before it and gives evidence.\"\nParliamentary committees do have the power to compel witnesses to attend, although there is an exemption if they can provide a \"reasonable excuse\".\nMr Salmond had said he would only appear if MSPs agreed to publish his written submissions in full, and to give certain guarantees about what he could speak about.\nThe committee was split over whether to publish one submission - which included detailed claims about Ms Sturgeon breaching the ministerial code - but narrowly voted down the proposal along party lines.\nOn Monday, the inquiry committee questioned SNP chief executive Peter Murrell - Ms Sturgeon's husband - amid a dispute over whether he had given contradictory evidence about his wife's meetings with Mr Salmond.\nHe told members that his previous evidence about the meetings being a government matter - rather than SNP business, as Ms Sturgeon has claimed - was \"speculation on my part\".\nHe said he would \"absolutely refute\" claims that he had given \"false information\", adding: \"It's pretty simple, I think you're trying to suggest things or knowledge that I just don't have about these things.\"\nDuring Thursday's Holyrood questions, Ms Davidson said that Mr Murrell \"may have committed perjury by changing his story under oath\".\nMs Sturgeon insisted that her husband \"did tell the truth\", adding that he \"is perfectly capable of standing up for himself\".\nShe added: \"It's clear to everyone why the opposition parties are so keen to drag Peter Murrell into a process he had no part in and try to damage him. Perhaps they know how integral he's been to the electoral success of the SNP, and conversely the electoral defeat of their parties.\"\nMs Davidson later said Ms Sturgeon had \"backed herself into a corner\" by supporting Mr Murrell's account, saying she was \"dismantling her own evidence\".\nShe said: \"If the SNP chief executive told the truth under oath, as Nicola Sturgeon insisted today, then the first minister misled parliament and broke the Ministerial Code. \n\"Peter Murrell said the Sturgeon-Salmond meetings were government business. The first minister has told the Parliament that they were not. \n\"That is a glaring contradiction. Both accounts cannot be correct.\""

His own group, Return to Forever, were at the forefront of the jazz fusion movement.\nThe late star was also known around the world for his work as a composer with hits like Spain and 500 Miles High. \n\"Through his body of work and the decades spent touring the world, he touched and inspired the lives of millions,\" a statement on his website said.\n\"An extraordinary composer and keyboardist, Chick rewrote the rulebook for jazz in his more than 5-decade long career, receiving mass critical acclaim along the way for his musical excellence.\"\nHis influence stretched far and wide, informing many different genres of music. Yusuf aka Cat Stevens described Corea as a \"genius\" and \"one of the most innovative and inspired musicians I ever had the privilege to work with\".\n\"Rest well maestro,\" added US R&B singer-songwriter Anita Baker.\nParliament-Funkadelic bassist Bootsy Collins called Corea \"a musical visionary\".\nAnd English electronic duo Disclosure posted a picture of Corea alongside a quote detailing his passion for learning.\nIn an interview with the BBC last November, Corea said he had spent lockdown taking on new projects and was looking forward to playing in front of a live audience again. His last album was released in 2020.\nCorea grew up in Massachusetts, and his father was a jazz trumpeter who led a Dixieland band in Boston in the 1930s and 1940s. He introduced his son to the piano and to the bebop of the likes of Dizzy Gillespie from a young age.\nSpeaking to the National Jazz Archive in 1978, Corea explained that it was his intention at the start of that decade to make \"more melodic music\".\n\"I find that every kind of really good jazz that I've ever been interested in - like the music of Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane or Miles Davis - it's always very lyrical music, you know,\" he said.\n\"And it's one of the most attractive elements in the music for me - the melodic line. So it's something that I desire to have in my music as well.\"\nScientology became a growing influence on his musical direction and personal beliefs during that period too.\nCorea is survived by his wife, vocalist and pianist Gayle Moran, his children and his grandchildren.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The UK and the EU have had a \"frank but constructive discussion\" on problems implementing post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove met the vice-president of the European Commission, Maros Sefcovic, in London on Thursday evening. \nBoth sides reiterated their \"full commitment\" to the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol.\nBut they pledged to meet again to \"address all outstanding issues\".\nMr Gove had previously called for an urgent \"reset\" on the arrangements, which see checks taking place between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - calling for a two-year \"grace period\" on the rules.\nBut the Irish Taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said any pause in enforcement could only be a matter of months, telling the BBC: \"It can't be a year.\" \nWriting to Mr Gove ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic said the existing protocol was \"the only way\" to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nHowever, Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster - who wants the protocol scrapped - said \"more rigorous implementation\" was \"not going to work\".\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to ensure an open border remained on the island of Ireland after Brexit.\nBut to make it work, the two sides agreed that Northern Ireland would remain in the single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK. \nThis meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nSince the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries.\nChecks at some ports were temporarily suspended at the beginning of February over \"sinister\" threats made to some border staff who were carrying out checks on goods.\nUnionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union.\nDUP leader Mrs Foster accused Mr Sefcovic of having his \"head in the sand\" over the issues, and called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \"step up\" to sort out the issues.\nBut the EU has stood by this part of the post-Brexit trade agreement, finalised in December and coming into force on New Year's Day.\nIn a joint statement after their meeting, Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic reiterated their \"full commitment\" to the Good Friday Agreement and to the \"proper implementation\" of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThey said this was necessary to ensure stability, prevent a hard border and \"impact as little as possible on the everyday life\" of people living on the island of Ireland.\nThe statement also said they had \"taken in to account\" the views expressed by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland.\nIt is understood Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic will hold a virtual meeting with Northern Ireland business leaders next week, before further discussions on 24 February. \nIrish Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, described the meeting as \"a good day's work\". \nIn a tweet, he said the \"focus now\" was on \"cooperation to implement what's been agreed in the protocol... and to work on solutions to outstanding issues\".\nSinn Fein's deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the two sides' commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and implementation of the protocol \"protecting the gains of peace, and avoiding a hard border in Ireland\".\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood told the BBC that the language of the statement was \"more constructive\", but Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the protocol was \"breaking\" Northern Ireland's links with Great Britain, which \"shouldn't be allowed to happen\"."

When he came back round at a lower altitude, he realised that there were people on the island in distress.\nThe crew was not equipped to carry out an immediate rescue, but food, water and a radio were dropped to them so they could communicate.\n\"Unfortunately we didn't have any fluent Spanish speakers but in my broken Spanish I was able to discern that they were from Cuba and that they needed medical assistance. They made sure to stress that they had been on the island for 33 days,\" Lt Beecher said.\nThe group of two men and one woman told Coast Guard officials that they swam to the island after their boat sank.\nJustin Dougherty said the group later told him they were \"able to get nourishment from coconuts\". \n\"At first glance the island doesn't seem to have much, but there is some shrubbery there and some trees so they were able to stay out of the elements somewhat,\" he said.\nUS media reports say they also survived on rats and conchs.\nThe trio were finally airlifted from the island by helicopter on Tuesday and taken to a medical centre in Florida, though they have no reported major injuries.\nThey have since been transferred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Coast Guard says.\nMembers of the rescue team told the BBC they had never witnessed a situation like it before.\n\"I've never come across anyone who's been [stranded] for anywhere like that length of time before,\" Lt Dougherty said.

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18.\nIf they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days.\nYou must self-isolate for 10 days if you:\nYou must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with has Covid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result.\nEach UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: \nWhen people test positive for coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include:\nIf you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms.\nScotland\nFrom 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. \nInstead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test.\nEngland\nFrom 16 August, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advised to take one PCR test as soon as possible. \nAs long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action.\nWales\nSimilar changes will happen in Wales from 7 August. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not.\nNorthern Ireland\nMinisters in Northern Ireland are expected to discuss changes on 12 August. \nAny adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts.\nAnyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. \nThe NHS Covid app is available to download in England and Wales. \nIf you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid. \nYou need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. \nNorthern Ireland and Scotland have separate apps. \nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nGovernment ministers have said it is \"crucial\"  that people self-isolate when sent an alert.\nHowever, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led to many users deleting the app.\nCurrently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time.\nHowever, the app will soon only alert close contacts from the previous two days before the positive test.\nThe sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate.\nIn the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before.\nIn England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated. Sectors include energy and emergency services.\nSupermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status.\nA similar system is being launched in Scotland.\nA \u00a3500 grant is available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, many applications have been turned down.\nIn Scotland people can apply for the Self-Isolation Support Grant, worth \u00a3500, and there is a similar scheme in Wales. In Northern Ireland a discretionary payment is available.\nYou may also be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth \u00a396.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme."

My work has been really careful in making sure that we've all been safe and I've always followed the rules from day one,\" he says.\n\"It just shows you how transmissible this virus is.\"\nOlder people are more at risk of developing severe disease or dying from coronavirus. But Heather Riddoch, the senior charge nurse here, says they have seen a different profile among some patients in the second wave.\n\"We're certainly seeing younger patients that are coming in and requiring ventilatory support,\" she says. \n\"All ages contract Covid, but we are seeing more people ending up in intensive care in their 30s and 40s in this second wave.\"\n\"I think it's more shocking to see younger people coming in. We've got patients in who are close to our age and younger. \n\"A lot of young nurses here are seeing patients who are the same age as their parents, and more families in the ward all at the one time as well. \n\"There's a definite shift there and it's shocking and it's more real because it could be you.\"\nThis means the increased protection of vaccination for the over-70s won't immediately relieve all the pressure on the NHS.\nNumbers in hospital and ICU are gradually falling across the country, and are now back below the peak seen in April.\nBut that's not the case everywhere, and here in Forth Valley Royal, clinicians are worried they're starting to see the worst of this wave.\nHeather says that earlier in the week things had started to get quieter. \n\"We really felt things had taken a good turn. However, in the last 48 hours we have doubled the number of patients admitted with Covid and it's been quite shocking at how quickly that rapid turnover has happened. \n\"We have actually had to open up another ward and it's a massive change from the beginning of the week.\"\nDr Fiona McIlveney, who is the clinical lead for intensive care, says the hospital may be feeling the impact of recent outbreaks in Falkirk and Clackmannanshire, which have put local infection rates among the highest in Scotland.\n\"I think we are probably a bit different from the rest of the country in that we are still seeing a rise in our Covid numbers in the hospital and in intensive care, she says.\n\"I think there is always going to be regional variation. It's not entirely clear why, but for us we are just starting to see this peak of activity now and this will be our focus for the next few weeks.\n\"Staff have done a phenomenal job for almost a year now. They've had to run their own lives outside of here, they've had the same challenges about home schooling, and worries about illness and family concerns, but every day they've squared their shoulders and come in here, and they have given their absolute all. \n\"I'm so proud of the way they have delivered excellent compassion and care to patients and their families.\"\nUnlike some other health boards, at Forth Valley Royal they have managed to continue with much of their scheduled non-coronavirus care.\nJust next door to the 10-bed Covid ICU, there's another unit where staff are caring for patients with heart problems, kidney failure, and the aftermath of drug overdoses. \nThey also look after patients who were previously in the Covid ward, but have now tested negative. \nThe Scottish government recognises that many patients are spending longer periods of time in intensive care. The most recent figures showed 28 coronavirus patients had been in ICU for longer than 28 days.\nDr McIlveney says the effects of long stays don't stop when patients leave the doors of the unit. \n\"I think our surviving patients can spend up to 60 or 70 days in here before they leave intensive care, and then that leads them still to a long period of rehabilitation,\" she says.\n\"The effects of that persist for some time and some people will never be the same again.\"\nRichard warns that some people still need to realise how serious the disease can be for younger adults.\n\"I mean this hand on heart, on my wee boy's life, you really need to wake up and take this seriously,\" he says. \"This is no joke, I wouldn't be wearing this mask for publicity.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus variant first found in Kent could become the world's dominant strain, the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme has predicted.\nProf Sharon Peacock told the BBC's Newscast podcast the new variant has \"swept the country\" and \"it's going to sweep the world, in all probability\".\nShe said her team's work sequencing variants of the virus could be required for at least 10 years.\nThe Kent variant has already been detected in more than 50 countries.\nIt was first detected in September 2020 in south-east England and its rapid spread over the following months was cited as the reason for the introduction of new lockdown rules across the UK in January.\nProf Peacock, director of the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, said: \"What's really affected us at the moment is transmissibility.\"\nShe added: \"Once we get on top of [the virus] or it mutates itself out of being virulent - causing disease - then we can stop worrying about it. But I think, looking in the future, we're going to be doing this for years. We're still going to be doing this 10 years down the line, in my view.\"\nShe explained this was not because she thought the pandemic would go on for 10 years, but she believed they would be sequencing new variants for that length of time.\nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well.\nProf Peacock said the vaccines approved for use in the UK appeared to work well against the existing variants of the virus in the country.\nThe Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium is a network of public health bodies and labs and currently analyses more than 20,000 positive tests a week. \nIn recent weeks, it has been explained that about 5-10% of positive tests are selected randomly to be sent on for further genome analysis but the consortium says, as the number of cases falls below its capacity, its aim is to genetically screen every positive coronavirus test.\nProf Peacock told Newscast that while it is normal to see variants, only a very small number have \"special features\". These can make them more transmissible, avoid the immune response and affect vaccination, or have the potential to cause more severe disease. \n\"These are the things we are looking out for. I'd say it happens vanishingly rarely but we have to be on the look out for it,\" the expert, who was previously director of the government's National Infection Service, said.\nIt comes as the World Health Organization is recommending using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine even in countries tackling new variants of coronavirus.\nThe Oxford jab has attracted controversy about its effectiveness against new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data.\nEarly data from trials in South Africa - where a variant has acquired mutations that seem to help it evade immunity from vaccines and from previous infections - showed the vaccine was offering \"minimal protection\" against mild and moderate disease in young people.\nBut the WHO's director of immunisation, Dr Katherine O'Brien, said the South African study was \"inconclusive\" and it was \"plausible\" the vaccine would still prevent severe disease.\nOxford scientists still expect their vaccine to prevent people from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and needing hospital treatment.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the two million people yet to take up their offer of a Covid jab to \"come forward\" this week.\nThe government is aiming to offer a first dose of a vaccine to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February.\nAs of Tuesday 13,058,298 had received a first vaccine dose, a daily rise of 411,812."

      "tags": "Weight loss,Obesity",
      "text": "A drug that suppresses appetite has led to some people losing more than a fifth of their body weight, a major international trial shows. \nA weekly injection of the drug, semaglutide, was given alongside advice on diet and fitness. \nThe study, conducted on almost 2,000 people, showed an average 15kg weight loss during the 15-month trial. \nScientists said the results could mark a \"new era\" in treating obesity with even more therapies on the horizon. \nJan, from Kent, lost 28kg (four stone), equivalent to more than a fifth of her body weight. \n\"The drug changed my life and completely altered my approach to food,\" she said.\nShe said dieting had made her \"miserable\" but taking the drug was completely different as she was less hungry. \nHowever, now Jan has come off the trial her appetite has returned and she is putting weight back on.\nShe said: \"It felt effortless losing weight while on the trial, but now it has gone back to feeling like a constant battle with food.\" \nSemaglutide will already be familiar to some people who use it as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but this trial looked at giving it at higher doses. \nThe drug works by hijacking the body's appetite levels and mimicking a hormone - called GLP1 - that is released after eating a filling meal. \nThe trial gave some people the drug and others a dummy injection, while both groups were given the lifestyle advice. \nThe results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed people lost an average of 15kg on semaglutide compared with 2.6kg without.\nHowever, 32% of people lost a fifth of their body weight with the drug, compared with fewer than 2% on the dummy treatment.\nProf Rachel Batterham, from UCL and one of the UK researchers, told the BBC News website: \"This is a game-changer in the amount of weight loss it causes.\n\"I have spent the last 20 years doing obesity research, up until now we've not had an effective treatment for obesity apart from bariatric surgery.\"\nShe said losing weight would reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and of severe Covid-19.\nSemaglutide is being submitted to drugs regulators so cannot be routinely prescribed. However, Prof Batterham expects the drug would be used initially by specialist weight loss clinics rather than being widely available. \nThere were side-effects to the treatment including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation. And there are five-year studies taking place to see if weight loss can be sustained in the long term. \nProf Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"The amount of weight loss achieved is greater than that seen with any licensed anti-obesity drug.\n\"This is the start of a new era for obesity drug development with the future direction being to achieve levels of weight loss comparable to semaglutide, while having fewer side-effects.\"\nDr Duane Mellor, a dietitian and from Aston Medical School, said: \"It is useful to have a potential option to help people lose weight, however we need to acknowledge that weight loss will still need lifestyle change, and that any medication or change in lifestyle can bring potential risks and side-effects.  \n\"So, it is always wise to speak to a health professional before trying to lose weight.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Boris Johnson has urged the two million people yet to take up their offer of a Covid jab to \"come forward\" this week.\nThe UK was closing in on Monday's target for vaccinating almost 15 million of its most vulnerable people, the PM told a Downing Street briefing.\nBut he said some people \"for one reason or another\" had not been vaccinated.\nMr Johnson said the aim was not to \"hit some numerical target, but to save lives... another step on the long and hard road back to normality\".\nThe government is aiming to offer a first dose of a vaccine to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February.\nAfter the first four priority groups receive their jabs, ministers hope that people aged 50 and over, as well as those with underlying health conditions will be vaccinated by the end of April.\nAs of Tuesday 13,058,298 had received a first vaccine dose, a daily rise of 411,812.\nMr Johnson said: \"With less than a week to go until the target date... there's no doubt we've made great strides, with just over 13 million people now vaccinated in our United Kingdom, including one in four adults in England, over 90% of everyone over 75 and over 90% of eligible residents of care homes for the elderly.\n\"But that still leaves nearly two million people, a population roughly twice the size of Birmingham, that we still hope to reach.\n\"And there are people across the country who for one reason or another haven't yet taken up their offer. So now is the moment to do it.\"\nMr Johnson appealed to care workers who still have not been vaccinated to contact their employer to \"fix it up\". His comments came after a survey suggested more than 30% of staff in nearly half of all care homes for older people have not been vaccinated.\nThe government is on track to meet its target to offer vaccines to 15 million people by Monday.\nBut the question now on everyone's lips is what difference is it making?\nGiven it takes two to three weeks for immunity to develop and then another few weeks for the impact of that to be seen in infection levels and hospitalisations, it is too early to tell for sure from the published data.\nThe government has been collecting data behind the scenes by monitoring cases in people who have been vaccinated. \nIt is expected to unveil that next week. \nEarly reports suggest it is having a significant difference - and if that is the case it will shift the dynamics of the pandemic significantly.\nThe latest official figures on Covid also show there have been a further 1,001 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and another 13,013 positive tests.\nThis compares to 1,322 deaths and 19,202 cases reported a week ago.\nMr Johnson acknowledged that the figures showing a reduction in Covid-19 cases were not necessarily down to the rollout of the vaccine.\nThe prime minister said: \"I've looked at the data and scrutinised it with my layman's eye and so far, yes we are getting the numbers down, but can I see results that I think are directly attributable to the vaccine? Although I'm assured that will happen soon, I can't say that I can see them yet.\"\nThe UK's chief medical adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the briefing there were still a \"significant number of people in high-risk groups\" who had not been vaccinated and the lifting of restrictions in England needed to take place with \"caution.\"\nSir Patrick said: \"Those people remain at risk and so it's important we go cautiously in opening up, in order to be able to measure the effects.\"\nSir Patrick was asked about Covid lateral flow tests (LFTs) as they began to be rolled out to more workplaces.\nHe said they were a \"really important part of our toolkit\", and while not as \"sensitive\" as a PCR lab test, were \"good with picking up people with high viral load, who are most infectious\", and who are asymptomatic.\nMr Johnson says LFTs will \"come into their own\" once the economy is starting to \"unlock\".\n\"They do have a very clear use case but it's in conjunction with everything we are doing and the priority is obviously vaccination.\""

      "text": "The average house price in Wales has gone over \u00a3200,000 for the first time, the country's biggest building society has said.\nThe Principality said lockdown had encouraged a \"race for space\" with people buying larger properties with bigger gardens. \nEighteen of the 22 council areas in Wales saw record prices in the last three months of 2020.\nBut sales were down 21% over that period compared with the previous year.\nAll council areas saw an increase in prices from 2019.\nThe average price for a home in Wales is \u00a3209,723.\nThe Principality's House Price Index does not take account of inflation over years so this is the \"nominal value\" rather than the \"real value\".\nTaking account of inflation, Wales was 7% below the record high from September 2007 but is the highest since July 2008 in real terms.\nPrices rose by 8.2% in 2020, the highest rate of increase in 15 years.\nBut there are concerns that some people might find themselves unable to get on to the property ladder due to rising prices.\nNot all property types are increasing equally, with demand for detached houses higher than other homes and the price of flats \"languishing since April 2020\".\nThe Principality index is based on sales figures from HM Land Registry. \nThere were double digit increases in annual prices in Anglesey (16%), Conwy (14%), Monmouthshire (14%), Flintshire (13%) and Newport (12%).\nBridgend, Ceredigion, Gwynedd and the Vale of Glamorgan were the only council areas that hadn't experienced peak prices but had still seen an increase from 2019.\nThe Welsh Government removed land transaction tax from all property sales below \u00a3250,000 from July 2020 to March 2021, saving buyers almost \u00a32,500 in tax per sale.\nElfed Wyn Jones returned to live at his family's farm near Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, last year after losing his job in Aberystwyth due to the pandemic.\nHe and his girlfriend, Anwen Duncan, would like to buy their own family home nearby with at least two bedrooms and they could afford a mortgage of up to \u00a3110,000, but he often sees places selling for in excess of \u00a3200,000.\n\"When the rare opportunity comes up with something in our price range, it gets sold quite quickly,\" he said.\nHe suggested a cap on the number of holiday lets in areas to stop them from \"driving up prices\".\n\"I know of about seven or eight of the couples in Trawsfynydd who'd love to buy a house and start a family but, again, the houses that are in their price range and my price range tend to sell like hot cakes,\" he said.\n\"It's quite heart-breaking really.\"\nNorth Wales estate agent Dafydd Hardy said business had been \"good\" over the last year which he had not expected due to the pandemic.\nHe said buyers have been looking to \"change lifestyle\" such as up-sizing.\n\"They've focused on their needs really, and that's what has created the market,\" he added.\nHe said the current lockdown measures had hit the market, with house sales down about 40% locally compared to last year.\n\"But we are expecting that the market will take off again.\"\nTom Denman, chief financial officer at Principality Building Society, said: \"The strength of the housing recovery in the second half of 2020 is striking, and this reflects both the stimulus provided by the Welsh Government in terms of the time-limited land transaction tax holiday, the pent-up demand which built up during the first lockdown, and the race for space to buy bigger properties with larger gardens.\n\"This increased demand has been driven by increased savings in many households during the lockdowns coupled with continued historic low mortgage rates. \n\"There has probably been some additional demand from buyers across the border with England, with house prices more affordable in Wales in relative terms,\" he added.\nHouse prices across the UK rose by 6.5% last year, according to Nationwide.\nBut the Halifax suggested there had been a drop in prices UK-wide between December and January.\n\"On a range of metrics - buyer inquiries, instructions to sell, agreed sales, activity per surveyor and sales to stock ratio, Wales was equal to, or outperformed, the most active of English regions,\" the House Price Index concluded.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The World Health Organization recommends using the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca even in countries tackling new variants of coronavirus.\nSome new forms of the virus appear to make vaccines less effective. \nThe WHO also says the vaccine can be used in people aged over 65, which some countries have advised against.\nSpacing out the two doses, as is happening in the UK, makes the vaccine more effective, it advises.\nThe Oxford vaccine is seen as the \"vaccine for the world\" as it is cheap, can be mass produced and is stored in a standard fridge.\nHowever, it has attracted controversy about its effectiveness against new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data.\nThe WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, known as Sage, has been scrutinising evidence from vaccine trials. \nIts interim recommendations say the vaccine is 63% effective overall. \nHowever, early data from trials in South Africa showed the vaccine was offering \"minimal protection\" against mild and moderate disease in young people.\nThe WHO's director of immunisation, Dr Katherine O'Brien, said the South African study was \"inconclusive\" and it was \"plausible\" the vaccine would still prevent severe disease. \nA variant in the country has acquired mutations that seem to help it evade immunity from vaccines and from previous infections.\nHowever Oxford scientists still expect their vaccine to prevent people from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and needing hospital treatment. \n\"There is no reason not to recommend its use even in countries that have circulation of the variant,\" said Dr Alejandro Cravioto, the chairman of WHO's Sage. \nThere has been criticism about a lack of data on the effectiveness of the vaccine in the elderly with some countries, including France and Germany, advising against using it in the over 65s.\nThe WHO said even though there was a small number of over 65s in the trials, other studies showed older people had a nearly identical immune response to younger adults so the vaccine should be used. \nThe scientific advisers also said giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increased the vaccine's effectiveness and provided greater protection.\nInitially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances.\nProf Sarah Gilbert, the chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: \"It is excellent news that the WHO has recommended use of the Sars CoV-2 vaccine first produced in Oxford. \n\"This decision paves the way to more widespread use of the vaccine to protect people against Covid-19 and gain control of the pandemic.\"\nBoris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, said he welcomed the WHO's support for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and for the longer interval between doses.\nIn the UK, more than 13 million people have now received a vaccine to protect against Covid-19. On Wednesday, another 1,001 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus.\nGlobally, there have been more than 2.3 million deaths with the disease during the pandemic"

      "title": "NHS reform: 'No better time than now' for changes, says Matt Hancock",
      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,NHS Wales,NHS,Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "The NHS in England is to be reformed so health and care services can work more closely together, the government says.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the planned restructure will mean a focus \"on the health of the population, not just the health of patients\". \nBut Labour questioned the timing of the changes \"in the middle of the biggest public health crisis our NHS has ever faced\", saying staff were exhausted.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no better time than now\".\nA full White Paper was published on Thursday, setting out the proposed future legislation.\n\"The pandemic has made the changes in this White Paper more not less urgent,\" Mr Hancock told MPs.\nThe shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012.\nMinisters believe the changes will put the NHS in a better position to cope with an ageing population and a rise in people with complex health conditions.\nOne-in-three patients admitted to hospital as an emergency has five or more health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or asthma, up from one-in-10 a decade ago.\nThose working in the health service said many of the rules in place were time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. \nAnnouncing the changes to MPs, Mr Hancock said the new system would see the NHS and local councils take decisions about local health together.\n\"The new approach is based on the concept of population health,\" he said.\nOrganisations called \"integrated care systems\" - which already exist in some parts of the country - will be set up in each part of England and be responsible for funding to support that area's health.\n\"They will provide not just for the treatments that are needed but support people to stay healthy in the first place,\" said Mr Hancock.\nResponding to criticism over the timing, Mr Hancock said the pandemic had \"brought home the importance of preventing ill health in the first place\".\nNigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the changes would be a \"re-wiring behind the dashboard\" and should not be too noticeable to patients.\nWhile it was not a \"magic bullet\", it could help different parts of the system work more closely together, he added.\nThe public will be rightly asking what difference these reforms make and why they are being introduced now in the middle of a pandemic.\nThe concept predates Covid - councils and the NHS have been piloting these approaches to integrated care over the past few years.\nBut, in many ways, the pandemic has speeded up the process. With more care being done out of hospital because of the pressures from Covid, community NHS and council care teams have been working ever more closely.\nThere is much to recommend greater joined up working. The 21st century patient has multiple conditions.\nTake a 70-year-old with heart problem and dementia who lives alone. They will need input from a heart specialist, support from community nurses and maybe the company of a befriending service.\nThe staff needed could come from three different organisations working and funded separately.  It creates bureaucracy and it is not hard to see how the quality of care suffers.\nThe white paper is an attempt to re-wire the NHS. But those working for the NHS argue that is just one part of the solution - staffing and investment will also play a role.\nThe proposals include scrapping the tendering rule, which sees providers and private companies compete to win contracts to run services.\nThis rule made it complicated for councils and different parts of the NHS to set up joint teams and pool their budgets, with some having to set up separate bodies to bid for contracts.\nInstead, the NHS and councils will be left to run services and told to collaborate with each other to pool resources.\nIt also gives the health secretary more control over NHS England and other national bodies, which had been given a large degree of autonomy under the 2012 changes.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour had long argued for more integrated care, but raised questions over the timing.\nHe also said the test of the reorganisation \"will be whether it brings waiting lists and times down, widens access especially for mental healthcare, drives up cancer survival rates and improves population health\".\nMr Ashworth added that \"legislation alone of course is not the answer to integration. \n\"We need a long-term funded workforce plan. We've not got one. We need a sustainable social care plan. We were promised one on the steps of Downing Street. We still don't have one.\"\nThe UK's social care system is under pressure with past governments failing to reform or fund the council-run system properly. \nIn their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding.\nMr Hancock told MPs the government was \"committed to the reform of adult social care and will bring forward proposals this year\".\nMeanwhile, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the reform will create a \"flexible can-do spirit\" across the health and care system.\nThe White Paper will cite examples of good practice, such as a care team at the Royal Derby Hospital which sees nurses from the community, council care services and hospital staff working together to plan the discharge of patients.\nChris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS managers, said it would end \"an unnecessarily rigid NHS approach to procurement\".\nThe Local Government Association welcomed the plans but said they did not provide the funding to put care services on a \"sustainable and long-term footing\".

The most recent holding message promised the site would be \"back soon\" and apologised for the inconvenience as it carried out \"maintenance\".\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said ministers \"must act to fix this urgently\".\n\"It is extremely worrying that even the limited hotel quarantine booking system is showing signs of failing from the outset,\" he said.\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \"Rooms are available from Monday 15 February and the portal will be open well before the go live date.\"\nAround 1,300 people a week are arriving into the UK from those countries at the moment, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said.\nThe Department of Health has arranged for about 4,700 rooms across 16 hotels to be available for the new quarantine system. Travellers have to book a place in quarantine - which lasts 10 days - before arriving in the UK.\nInternational travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed.\nThe cost of the hotel quarantine packages is \u00a31,750 per adult for 11 nights, which includes transport and testing. \nFor extra adults or a child over 12 the cost is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325.\nIn Scotland, the cost is the same for one adult - \u00a31,750 - but the government is still working through the costs for extra travellers. The Scottish government is also launching a fund for people who cannot afford the charge.\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel when required will carry a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nGiving false travel history information on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in by travellers when they arrive in the UK will attract a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\nAll arrivals from countries not on the \"red list\" must see out a 10-day quarantine at home, but will be required to pay \u00a3210 for two additional private virus tests, booked prior to arrival.\nIt came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was \"too early\" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead this year.\nMr Hancock said there was still \"a lot of uncertainty\" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year.\nHe told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall \"months ago\".\nSir Keir urged the government to \"get rid of the mixed messages\" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year.\nDowning Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February."

      "text": "Scotland's transport secretary says he is pressing the UK government to close a loophole which could allow travellers to avoid new Covid quarantine rules.\nMichael Matheson told BBC Scotland the current UK arrangements for enforced isolation in hotels were \"inadequate\".\nNew UK quarantine rules only apply to people arriving from 33 countries deemed \"high risk\", but Scotland's apply to all international travellers.\nThere are fears traveller could avoid the rules by flying into England first.\nEveryone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at a cost of \u00a31,750.\nThe Scottish government has block-booked rooms at six hotels near Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.\nMr Matheson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme he believed there should be a \"comprehensive system\" across the UK on managed isolation to reduce the risk of importing variants of Covid-19.\n\"Our preferred option would be for individuals to be required to self-isolate at the point of entry into the UK, rather than travelling from one part of the UK to self-isolate when they get into Scotland or Northern Ireland or any other part of the UK,\" he said.\n\"[The UK government] want to continue to take a targeted approach on the way in which individuals enter into ports of entry in England.\n\"Our view is that remains inadequate in order to prevent the risk of new variants entering into the country and that is why we we're continuing to pursue and press the UK government to listen to the clinical advice and expert opinion from the Joint Biosecurity Centre that the existing system operating isn't adequate.\"\nAsked if Scotland would introduce controls on the border with England to ensure people travelling to Scotland via an English airport were complying, Mr Matheson said the Scottish government was looking at a \"range of measures\".\nThe \u00a31,750 cost of the stay in managed quarantine will have to be paid for by the passengers themselves.\nThe charge includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs. \nAnyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct.\nMr Matheson told the BBC that about 1,600 people travelled to Scotland from abroad last week.\n\"If you take out those who would be subject to an exemption, we estimate there would be the need for potentially around 1,200 individuals to self-isolate in a managed quarantine facility,\" he said.\n\"One of the things that may happen as a result of the policy we have taken forward, is that some of the airlines may choose to draw back on their international flights into Scotland.\n\"And there is some indication that the airlines may choose to cancel their flights coming into Scotland next week as a result of the managed isolation provision we have put in place, on the basis that they believe the demand for those flights is going to drop off dramatically as a result.\"\nThe oil and gas industry has said the 10-day quarantines could have a massive impact on business.\nTrevor Stapleton, from industry body Oil and Gas UK said: \"Given that they are doing critical roles and that the rotas have been planned a good year in advance, to suddenly say that that individual cannot go offshore - and therefore they have to quarantine for 10 days - would have a couple of outcomes.\n\"If they are doing a critical role then either they... have to stay on the installation for a further 10 days, and if that's not possible, if the person has to come back, then you are looking quite seriously at whether you can continue to operate that installation.\"\nMr Matheson said that there would be \"some level of exemptions\" provided for some passengers.\n\"We're looking at particular aspects around the oil and gas sector and also around areas such as defence and areas of critical infrastructure as well,\" he added.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday that new UK border measures built on \"touch actions\" already taken to prevent news variants of Covid-19 entering the country.\nHe also said that the UK government was working on \"similarly tough schemes with the devolved administrations\"."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,United States",
      "text": "The US is preparing to mark the first anniversary of the attacks on its seat of government by a mob of Trump supporters.\nPresident Joe Biden will blame Donald Trump as he starts a day of commemorative events in the nation's capital. \nSpeaking at Congress, where rioters stormed the building one year ago, Mr Biden will say his predecessor holds \"singular responsibility\" for the \"chaos and carnage\".\nInvestigators have so far arrested 725 suspects in connection with the attack. \nHere are the key moments from the day.\nPresident Donald Trump tweets allegations of vote fraud ahead of his rally in Washington DC. \nMembers of the Proud Boy movement, a right-wing militia, are seen heading towards the Capitol. Speaking to Newsnight's US correspondent David Grossman, one member of the group says: \"We're taking our country back.\" \nOne of the group has a radio. \"It was clear he was communicating - getting messages, sending messages to somebody,\" our correspondent said. \nPresident Trump begins his speech to supporters in Washington. Some 15 minutes into it, he starts urging them to converge on the Capitol. \n\"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,\" he said. \nAs the president speaks, a crowd outside the Capitol is swelling. They begin marching towards the police barrier and get past officers. The police, outnumbered, try to contain them. \nTrump supporters wield flags and weapons. One man stands on a makeshift gallows, complete with a noose. The crowd chants: \"Fight for Trump.\" \nMinutes later, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi commences the certification process. \nMr Trump ends his speech with the words: \"We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\nShortly afterwards a Capitol police officer calls for backup. \n\"They're throwing metal poles at us,\" he says. \"Multiple law-enforcement injuries,\" he adds in a panicked voice. \nCapitol police send an evacuation warning. \nProtesters surge past Capitol police protecting the west steps, the side facing the White House. \nMinutes later, an officer declares there is a riot at the Capitol.  \"We're going to give riot warnings,\" he says. \"We're going to try to get compliance but this is now effectively a riot.\"\nMeanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is continuing to preside over the session. \nSecret Service quickly and suddenly evacuate Mr Pence from the Senate floor. \nThe protesters break through the windows. They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags.\nAn immediate recess of the Senate is called. \nA minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety. \nThe mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber. \nOfficer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob. \nHe lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged.\nBy that point, the rioters are \"within 100ft\" (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside. \nAt the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location. \nHer staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table. \nStaff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself.\nThe rioters chant: \"Where are you Nancy?\" In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: \"They're pounding on doors trying to find her.\"\nOne man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on.\nPresident Trump tweets about Mr Pence. \nAt the same time, Mr Pence is evacuated to a secure location. \nRioters start to spread through the buildings. Others break in from outside through various doors around the building. \nThey open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers. \nThe House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them. \nThe House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count. \nBut minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary. \n\"Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,\" lawmakers are told. \nDemocratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: \"I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me\". \nThe mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door. \nPresident Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone.\nAccording to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague.\nMr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. \"I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go.\"\nHouse impeachment managers say it is further evidence that the president knew how much danger his vice-president was in.\nAshli Babbit is seen turning the corner towards the House lobby doors as members are leaving.\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern is spotted by the mob as he leaves the House floor. \nIn a hallway outside the House chamber, a group attempts to force its way through a set of locked doors. The glass window panes on the doors are shattered. A rioter uses a baton to smash through as the crowd around him chants \"break it down, break it down\".\nFootage shows the hands of an officer on the other side, holding a gun and pointing it toward the mob.

      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "text": "A mother who suffocated her disabled 10-year-old boy after reaching her \"wits' end\" during lockdown has been detained in hospital indefinitely.\nDylan Freeman's body was found in Acton, west London, on 16 August with a sponge in his mouth.\nHis mother Olga Freeman pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.\nThe judge said Dylan was \"an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\nFreeman was sentenced to a hospital order under the Mental Health Act without a limit of time.\nMrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a \"rare and desperately sad\" case.\nDylan had autism, Cohen syndrome - which is linked to abnormalities in many parts of the body - and significant difficulties with language and communication.\nProsecutor Gareth Patterson QC said Dylan required round-the-clock care and had attended a special school five days a week but had been unable to go during the lockdown as it had shut.\nThis took a toll on Freeman, the court heard.\nMr Patterson added: \"Last year during the first lockdown and through the summer she struggled more and more with her son.\n\"Eventually she suffered a mental health breakdown.\"\nPolice found Dylan in a bedroom lying on his back covered by a duvet after Freeman had walked into a police station to report she had killed her child.\nA post-mortem found he died from restriction of the airways from pieces of sponge that had been stuffed in his mouth.\nPsychiatrist Dr Martin Lock said Freeman had \"developed psychotic symptoms when under very heavy stress because of the Covid-19 lockdown\".\nRequests were made to increase support for Dylan's care but Ealing Council appeared to be \"slow\" in responding, the court heard.\nMr Patterson said: \"The council does seem to have been slow in determining her requests for increased financial assistance and she felt let down by the council.\"\nThe court heard a serious case review was expected to conclude shortly.\nSentencing Freeman, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the burden of looking after Dylan meant she had reached her \"wits' end\".\nShe added: \"I have no doubt at all that you were a remarkably loving and dedicated mother to a vulnerable child until multiple pressures overwhelmed you and your mind was swamped by a destructive illness with florid psychotic elements.\"\nAfter sentencing, Ealing Council said Dylan had received 30 hours of care a week - 16 of which were council-funded.\n\"It is clear from the evidence from the review so far, that this death could not have been foreseen,\" it said.\n\"This tragic incident reflects the most extreme and traumatic aspect of the challenges experienced by many parents in trying to do their best to care for their children during a global pandemic.\"\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."
