      "title": "Coronavirus: More work needed to rule out China lab leak theory says WHO",
      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Wuhan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said further investigation is needed to conclusively rule out that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in China. \nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that although a lab leak was the least likely cause, more research was needed.\nThe US and other countries have criticised China for failing to provide the WHO with sufficient data.  \nBeijing has always dismissed the allegations of a virus leak.\nA report by WHO and Chinese experts released on Tuesday, said the lab leak explanation was highly unlikely and the virus had probably jumped from bats to humans via another intermediary animal. \nChina has yet to respond to the WHO's latest statement. \nHowever the theory that the virus might have come from a leak in a laboratory \"requires further investigation, potential with additional missions involving specialist experts,\" Dr Tedros said on Tuesday.  \n\"Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table,\" he added. \nThe virus was first detected in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in late 2019. An international team of experts travelled to to the city in January to probe the origins of the virus. \nTheir research relied on samples and evidence provided by Chinese officials but Dr Tedros said the team had difficulty accessing raw data and called for \"more timely and comprehensive data sharing\" in the future. \nThe team investigated all possibilities, including one theory that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is the world's leading authority on the collection, storage and study of bat coronaviruses. \nIn response to the WHO report, the US and 13 allies including South Korea, Australia and the UK voiced concern over the findings and urged China to provide \"full access\" to experts. \nThe statement said the mission to Wuhan was \"significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples\".\n\"Scientific missions like these should be able to do their work under conditions that produce independent and objective recommendations and findings.\"\nThe group pledged to work together with the WHO. \nFormer US President Donald Trump was among those who supported the theory that the virus might have escaped from a lab.\nWHO investigation team leader, Peter Ben Embarek said on Tuesday his team had felt under political pressure, including from outside China but said he was never pressed to remove anything from the team's final report.\nHe also confirmed his team had found no evidence that any laboratories in Wuhan were involved in the outbreak. \nDr Embarak also said that it was \"perfectly possible\" that cases were circulating in the Wuhan area in October or November 2019. China informed the WHO about cases on 3 January, a month after the first reported infection. \nChina has always rejected claims the virus originated in a lab and says that although Wuhan is where the first cluster of cases was detected, it is not necessarily where the virus originated. \nState media has claimed that the virus may have arrived in Wuhan on frozen food imports.\nThe country has largely brought its own outbreak under control through quick mass testing, stringent lockdowns and tight travel restrictions.\nWorldwide, more than 127 million people have caught the virus since it was first identified, and more than 2.7 million people are known to have died from it."

      "text": "The taoiseach (Irish PM) has announced that from 12 April people will be allowed to travel within their county for exercise and recreation.\nMiche\u00e1l Martin outlined various dates for easing Covid-19 restrictions in the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday.\nThe country's National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommended a cautious approach.\nFrom 12 April, two households can meet outdoors and the construction industry can return to work.\nFrom 19 April, some additional high performance training will be allowed, including senior-inter county GAA training.\nHe said training for high-performing athletes approved by Sport Ireland will also be allowed. \nFrom 26 April, those who are fully vaccinated can meet other fully vaccinated people indoors, provided both people have had their second doses at least 14 days previously.\nOn the same date golf and outdoor tennis can resume, some outdoor visitors such as zoos can reopen and the number of people permitted to attend a funeral will increase from 10 to 25.\nRecommencement of religious services on a staggered basis will be considered after 4 May.\nMr Martin said vaccines will get the country \"out of this pandemic\" but said that disruptions to supply have held things back. \nHe said supply will dramatically increase in April, May and June.\nMore than 800,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered, he added.\nBy the middle of April, all those over 70 will have their first dose and he added that six million doses should be administered by the end of July.\n\"Less than two weeks from now all of our children will be back at school. In four weeks many of our outdoor sporting facilities will be open again,\" he said.\n\"We are on the final stretch of this terrible journey,\" he added. \nHowever he urged people to still be careful even though things are difficult\n\"Sometimes the challenge of living with these restrictions obscures their purpose but we should never forget that by accepting the restrictions on our lives, we have saved lives.\n\"The disease we are dealing with now is a very different beast to that which we were facing in the first lockdown more than 54 weeks ago.\n\"The so called UK or B117 variant is essentially a new virus - if it is given any space will spread quickly and the consequences are terrible.\"\nThe Irish cabinet agreed to the following measures.\nThat from April 12: \nFrom April 19:\nFrom April 26: \nThe Republic has been under its highest level of coronavirus restrictions since 30 December.\nThe level five restrictions include a ban on all household visits, the closure of non-essential retail and a 5km limit on travel.\nOther restrictions include the closure of sports including golf and tennis, with the exception of professional or elite sports like Gaelic games and horse racing behind closed doors."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK does not know \"exactly how strong\" its defences against another wave of Covid will be despite the \"impressive\" vaccine rollout, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nHe said cases were still rising in Europe and people \"must proceed with caution\" as lockdown eases.\nThe PM was speaking as the stay-at-home rule came to an end in England, allowing groups to meet outdoors.\nHe warned more deaths, infections and hospitalisations were inevitable.\nEuropean countries have seen a rising number of cases in recent weeks amid a slower vaccine rollout than in the UK.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference the relaxation of restrictions would be \"prized\" by people and that it was \"only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step toward freedom\". \nHe added: \"The vaccine rollout has been very impressive... but what we don't know is exactly how strong our fortifications now are, how robust our defences are against another wave.\n\"What we need to do is to continue flat out to build the immunity of our population, build our defences against that wave when it comes.\"\nThe prime minister said: \"That's why I stress the importance of everybody maintaining the discipline people have shown for so long.\"\nThe message was loud and clear - a rise in infections is inevitable as the UK unlocks.\nBut what is uncertain is when this will happen and what impact it will have on serious illness and deaths.\nA surge now would be the worst outcome.\nThe vaccination rollout has gone very well, but people are still in the process of building up immunity and not everyone in the most at-risk groups has come forward for a jab.\nThe vaccines, while good, are not 100% effective.  It is why ministers and their advisers are urging caution.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says if people stick to the rules any increase could be modest.\nThe seasons may also help - respiratory viruses thrive more in the colder months.\nThe lower estimates of modelling done for the government suggests there could be 30,000 deaths by summer 2022.\nThat would be in line with a bad flu winter. But it could also be much, much worse.\nIf there is one thing we have learnt, nothing can be taken for granted with Covid.\nAlong with England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty and the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson stressed the importance of people who had a first dose of a vaccine getting a second jab.\nProf Whitty said the \"wall of vaccination\" will get stronger once people receive their second doses.\nBut he said \"it is not a complete wall\" and highlighted risks for the UK from rising cases elsewhere - the chance of importing infections and the \"much bigger\" concern of variants which could reduce a vaccine's effectiveness.\nProf Whitty said: \"If you get a very big wave, that would obviously lead to a significant impact. So that's the reason why the prime minister and ministers have been absolutely determined that this is a slow and steady unlocking, looking at data between each step.\"\nThe briefing was held for the first time from the media suite built at Downing Street at a cost of \u00a32.6m.\nMr Johnson announced the government had agreed a deal with UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline that will see the final stage of the manufacture of up to 60 million doses of its yet-to-be approved Novavax vaccine completed in north-east England.\nHe said Novavax, which is to be produced at the Fujifilm plant in Stockton-on-Tees, will be finished and bottled by GSK at its facility in Barnard Castle.\nA further 4,654 Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Monday, compared with 5,342 cases a week ago. There were another 23 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive test, compared with 17 on the same day last week.\nThe latest figures show 293,542 UK adults received a first dose of the vaccine on Sunday, taking the overall number to 30,444,829 - with 146,785 having their second dose, bringing that total to 3,674,266.\nTwo households or groups of up to six people are now able to meet outside in England after the latest easing of the lockdown rules.\nOutdoor sport facilities, including swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses, have reopened, and organised outdoor sports resumed.\nWeddings are also on again, attended by up to six people.\nThe next stage in the relaxation of the rules in England will take place no earlier than 12 April with non-essential retail reopening, and restaurants and pubs allowed to serve outdoors. \nThe prime minister told the briefing he could not \"see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap\".\nIn Wales, the \"stay local\" rule was lifted on Saturday, with six people allowed to meet outside and stay in self-contained holiday accommodation. The stay home order in Scotland will end on Friday, and from Thursday in Northern Ireland up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outdoors."

      "text": "Voters could see political adverts on social media during the Senedd election campaign without knowing who is behind them.\nLeaflets and print adverts must say who has produced and paid for them.\nCampaigners said the Welsh government \"missed an opportunity\" to update election laws so the same rules applied to digital advertising for May's vote.\nThe Welsh government said it wanted to work with other governments to create new regulations.\nMandatory digital imprints, which make clear who is responsible for the political adverts, will be introduced for Westminster general elections under plans outlined by the UK government.\nThat would mean voters could see who was trying to influence them and help watchdogs keep track of campaign spending.\nAlthough ministers in Cardiff support the idea, it is too late for the Senedd to change the law before the election on 6 May.\nDigital imprints are being made compulsory in Scotland, where devolved elections are happening on the same day.\nOnline advertising spending has risen sharply in British elections since 2010.\nIt is thought to have accounted for more than half of campaign spending at the 2019 general election and social media is predicted to be even more important now that Covid has restricted traditional canvassing.\nElectoral Reform Society Cymru director Jess Blair said: \"It's a real missed opportunity that the Welsh government haven't legislated around digital imprints for the Senedd elections this year.\n\"We've seen Scotland go ahead and do this for their elections. The legislation isn't perfect but it's a lot better than what we have in place in Wales.\"\nShe said the Welsh government should not wait for UK government legislation\n\"You shouldn't be waiting for the slowest person in the race,\" she said.\n\"You should be trying to win that race and actually deliver better democracy and better transparency in our elections.\"\nThe Welsh government said it was \"committed to fair and transparent elections and digital campaigning has become an increasingly significant portion of democratic engagement from political groups\".\nA spokesman said it was not possible to legislate in time for May's election, but \"we will be working closely with the other administrations of the UK to ensure there will be a robust and transparent system in the future\".\nThe UK government said its legislation on digital imprints would \"increase transparency\" and \"ensure greater scrutiny\".\nCabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said it was a \"complex\" issue, adding: \"We need to be mindful not to impose excessive regulation of free speech by individuals, nor force campaigners to publish their home addresses as part of the imprint requirement.\"\nThe Electoral Commission previously said it was \"disappointed\" the rules were not changed in time for May's Senedd election.\nIt has launched a campaign to help voters \"think critically\" about political advertising. \nSpokesman Craig Westwood said: \"Political adverts are an important part of how voters find out about who are standing as candidates, and what they think about key issues, but we know that people are increasingly concerned about online adverts, if they can't easily tell who is targeting them, and why.\"\nFacebook said it was \"constantly working to increase ad transparency and election integrity\" on its platforms.\n\"We do not allow political ads to run without a disclaimer providing more information about who is running them,\" a spokesman said.\n\"This includes ensuring anyone running a political ad goes through a verification process to prove who they are and that they are based in the UK, and that ads carry a 'paid for by' disclaimer if targeting people in the UK.\"\nPlaid Cymru said: \"Plaid Cymru will support any move to make our elections more open and transparent and digital imprints would play a key role in upholding the integrity of our elections.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said the party supported digital imprints.\nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader, Jane Dodds, said the party supported \"transparency and fairness\" in digital campaigning.\nShe added: \"We would also, however, urge platform-owners, such as Facebook and Twitter, to make available digital imprint tools to easier facilitate this process.\""

      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "A witness has told of the last harrowing minutes of George Floyd's life on the opening day of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the white American policeman accused of killing him.\nDonald Williams III, a witness for the prosecution, said Mr Floyd was \"slowly fading away\" during the nine minutes Mr Chauvin kneeled on his back and neck.\nMr Chauvin's lawyer argued his use of force was \"unattractive but necessary\".\nThis trial is being seen by many as a pivotal moment in US race relations.\nThe May 2020 incident - in which Mr Chauvin was captured on video kneeling on the neck of Mr Floyd, a black man, in the city of Minneapolis - sparked protests in the US and across the world against police brutality and racism.\nMr Chauvin, 45, who was dismissed from the police, denies murder and manslaughter charges, which carry sentences of up to 40 years in prison. \nThree other officers present - Tou Thao, J Alexander Keung and Thomas Lane - will go on trial later in the year.\nDonald Williams, a 33-year-old entrepreneur, said he had been planning to enter the Cup Foods shop, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, when he witnessed the arrest of Mr Floyd on 25 May 2020.\nHe said he decided against entering the shop because \"the energy was off\", and instead began a conversation with the arresting police officers and urged them to check Mr Floyd's pulse.\nHe told the court he could see Mr Floyd's life slipping away. \"He's slowly fading away like a fish in a bag,\" he said. \"His eyes slowly rolled to the back of his head\" until \"he didn't have no life in him no more in his body\".\nAt the start of the trial, prosecutors began by showing the nine-minute long videotape, shot by one of the bystanders, that showed Mr Chauvin kneeling on 46-year-old Mr Floyd.\nProsecutor Jerry Blackwell told jurors that Mr Floyd said 27 times that he could not breathe.\nThe tape proves Mr Chauvin was \"engaging in behaviour that was imminently dangerous... without regard for its impact on the body of George Floyd,\" Mr Blackwell said.\nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson, in his opening statements, said that the evidence \"is far greater than nine minutes and 29 seconds\" of video footage.\nHe said the evidence would show Mr Floyd \"died of a cardiac arrhythmia, that occurred as a result of hypertension, coronary disease, the ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl, and adrenaline flowing through his body\".\nThe court also heard testimony from 911 police despatcher Jena Scurry, who deployed police to the Cup Foods shop after George Floyd was reported for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill.\nA camera fixed on the side of the building allowed her to watch the arrest unfold. She admitted her viewing had been sporadic as she fielded other calls, but told jurors that she thought the \"screens had frozen\" because of the length of time Mr Floyd was kept on the ground and became \"concerned that something might be wrong\". \nThe court also heard from one of those who filmed the incident, Alisha Oyler, who had been working in a nearby shop. \nBefore the trial began, Mr Floyd's family, civil rights lawyers and activists knelt outside the courthouse for the length of time Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck.\nFifteen jurors - nine women and six men - were originally selected; nine of them white and six black or multiracial.\nOne juror - who was a back-up option in case a juror dropped out before proceedings began - was dismissed on Monday, and the trial began with 12 jurors and two alternates.\nThey will remain anonymous and unseen throughout the televised trial, which is expected to last about four weeks.\nThe courthouse in central Minneapolis has been fortified with concrete barriers, fencing, and barbed and razor wire.\nThe video footage of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck last May was replayed the world over.\nTo many, Floyd's death while in police custody became a vivid symbol of police brutality - particularly against people of colour - and it sparked worldwide demonstrations for racial justice.\nBut despite the global outcry this is not an open and shut case. In the US, police are rarely convicted for deaths that occur while they are on duty, if they are charged at all.\nThe verdict in this case will be widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system treats deaths that occur while in police custody."

      "tags": "Policing,Sarah Everard murder,Clapham,Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "The Metropolitan Police acted \"appropriately\" at a vigil for Sarah Everard in south London earlier this month, a police watchdog has found.\nThe force came under intense criticism after women were handcuffed and removed from crowds on Clapham Common.\nA report said there was too little communication between officers at the event but their response, amid Covid restrictions, had been \"measured\".\nIt called the media coverage a \"public relations disaster\" for police.\nMs Everard, 33, was last seen walking home nearby on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent - prompting a public debate over women's safety. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel, who commissioned the independent investigation into the force's decisions on the evening of the vigil, said she backed the police and the report had found they acted in the \"right way\" over the vigil.\nShe said there had been violence shown towards officers which was \"simply unacceptable\" and called for people not to \"prejudge the police\" based on footage because \"images can be taken out of context\".\nOrganisers of the vigil said the report was \"disappointing\" and said the Met will have to deal with years of trying to \"regain that trust\" over its policing of the event.\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that the force was \"justified\" in deciding that the risks of transmitting coronavirus \"were too great to ignore\" and officers \"did their best to peacefully disperse the crowd\".\nHowever, it added that \"there was insufficient communication between police commanders about changing events on the ground\".\nHMICFRS said calls for Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick to resign - including from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey  - were \"unwarranted\".\nA spokesman for the Lib Dems said: \"We stand by our view that in the circumstances, the Met commissioner got the judgment on the vigil badly wrong.\"\nThe report said most protesters had behaved in a \"dignified and respectful\" way but some police, including female officers, faced abuse and hostility.\nThe inspectorate said \"the chorus of those condemning\" the force after the event showed \"a distinct lack of respect for public servants facing... a sensitive and complex situation\".\n\"It is one thing... to recognise that the scenes were worrying or upsetting (and to order an inspection such as this). It is another to jump to conclusions - and in doing so, undermine public confidence in policing - based on very limited evidence,\" the report said.\nWhatever the official report might say about the police response, the inspectors accept that the reputation of policing in London took a big hit on Clapham Common.  \nPowerful images of a woman under arrest, lying beside the boots of male police officers, were quickly reproduced around the world on social media. \nThe inspectors say a more conciliatory approach to criticism \"might have served the force's interests better\" but they also note the \"chorus\" of what they call \"unwarranted\" and \"uninformed\" condemnation of the police from people in positions of some responsibility.\nThe police were wrong in their reading of the law, the report finds. Some protests can take place legally, even in areas under Tier 4 lockdown. The Met could have worked with Reclaim These Streets to manage a safe and respectful vigil.  But they didn't because of \"confusion\" over the law.  \nAnd once again, the finger is pointed at the politicians. The report says this: \"It is incumbent on the legislature to provide a set of rules that is readily capable of being accurately interpreted and applied.\"  \nIf the police are largely vindicated by this report, the politicians are most certainly not. \nHMICFRS said \"a more conciliatory response after the event might have served the Met's interests better\".\nIt said the events had a \"materially adverse effect on public confidence in policing\". \nHMICFRS said its inspection involved reviewing documents and body camera video footage.\nMatt Parr, who led the inspection team, said: \"We found that there are some things the Met could have done better, but we saw nothing to suggest police officers acted in anything but a measured and proportionate way in challenging circumstances.\"\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe said officers had acted \"sensibly and proportionately... given we remain in a public health crisis\" and \"spent considerable time engaging, explaining and encouraging before considering any enforcement action\".\nShe said: \"We welcome the considered scrutiny of this event which highlights how a snapshot may not represent the full context of the challenges police face.\"\nKen Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the outcome of the report was \"no surprise\" - and hit out at \"armchair critics\".\n\"The knee-jerk commentary from politicians of all parties - who as the report states were reacting to a snapshot on social media rather than the facts - has made the already difficult job of our colleagues in London incredibly harder. And more dangerous,\" he said.\nImages and footage from the resulting vigil on Clapham Common prompted widespread concern, including among the country's most prominent political figures.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the scenes, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called them \"disturbing\".\nThe Labour leader said he \"remained concerned\" about the events but accepted the findings of the report.\nSir Keir added it was \"very important women and girls have confidence in the police\".\nLabour London Mayor Sadiq Khan - who called police actions \"unacceptable\" at the time - said he accepted the conclusions of the report.\nBut he said it was \"clear that trust and confidence of women and girls in the police and criminal justice system is far from adequate\", adding that the events had \"done further damage to this\".\nShaun Bailey, Conservative candidate for Mayor of London, said Mr Khan had \"serious questions\" to answer over his response to the policing of the demo.\nIn a tweet, the Labour MP for Streatham, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, suggested the report could \"heighten the impression that the police are not listening to women, or respecting the right to protest\".\nTensions between those who wanted to hold a vigil and police began before the evening of 13 March.\nAn official event had been planned by Reclaim These Streets - but the group called it off, saying police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nPeople turned up to Clapham Common despite the group asking them not to. \nReclaim These Streets said the HMICFRS report was evidence of \"institutional sexism running through the force\".\n\"We warned the Met Police... that forcing us to cancel would cause additional risk to public safety, as did Lambeth Council. They completely dismissed our warning and concerns,\" it said in a statement posted on Twitter.\nJamie Klingler, an organiser for the group who gave evidence to the HMICFRS, told the BBC police had \"created the situation and then were left to deal with it\".\nShe said protests were not banned under Covid laws but police had failed to provide Reclaim These Streets with the \"parameters\" in which to protest safely.\nPolice said the report had made it clear there were \"good reasons\" why they could not come to an agreement to allow the planned vigil to take place.\nAn inquest into Ms Everard's death has been adjourned until the conclusion of criminal proceedings.\nPC Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with her murder and kidnap.\nHe has been remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 9 July ahead of a trial that is set to start on 25 October."

      "text": "Members of a golf club with holes in both England and Wales can now cross the border during rounds.\nPowys council had told Llanymynech Golf Club that members from England ran the risk of being fined for breaching Covid travel rules for crossing the border.\nBut the Welsh government has said it is reasonable for golfers from either country \"to enter or leave Wales\". \nPeople in Wales need a reasonable excuse to leave the country. Those in England are asked to \"minimise travel\". \nOutdoor sport facilities, including golf courses, reopened in Wales on Saturday and in England on Monday.\nThe club's entrance is in Shropshire, England along with the 5th and 6th holes.\nHowever the clubhouse and 15 of the course's 18 holes are entirely in Powys, Wales, while those playing the 4th hole tee-off in one country - only to find the green in the other.\nMore than 100 of the club's 450 members had been expected to tee-off to mark the easing of lockdown measures in England on Monday. However the course instead hosted just a handful of members resident in Wales.\nClub chairman Stuart Jones said: \"We have been told [by the council] that English members are not allowed to play... and they said Welsh residents could play. It's just a nonsense really.\n\"The entrance is in England and without the English residents we wouldn't have a golf course because it's two-thirds of our membership.\"\nAsked what impact the legal advice from the council had on the club on Monday, Mr Jones replied: \"The course is dead. We would probably have about 150 people playing today, on a normal Monday. I saw two people on the course and that was it.\n\"It's sad. It was nice and sunny and the bookings were full to play. We have waited three months and people were desperate for a game. It's just nuts.\"\nThe situation mirrors confusion last summer when local pubs yards apart faced differing regulations on reopening.\nBefore the Welsh government clarified rules around access to the course, a spokesperson for Powys council said: \"We understand the frustrations that Llanymynech Golf Club are currently experiencing and are working with them to find a workable solution.\n\"However, the Welsh government currently have travel restrictions in place which means travel into and out of Wales is not permitted unless you have a reasonable excuse.\n\"The council has provided advice to Llanymynech Golf Club on what the latest restrictions are following the Welsh government's announcement at the end of last week. Travel restrictions can only be enforced by the police.\"\nNorth Shropshire MP Owen Paterson said the situation surrounding the club was ludicrous.\nThe Conservative MP tweeted: \"Ludicrous statements from the Labour administration in Wales. They say Shropshire people can't attend cross-border Llanymynech Golf Club, yet people in Wales can cross to the club's entrance in Shropshire!\n\"My constituents should be free to enjoy safe exercise and fresh air today.\"\nIn a statement issued on Monday, a Welsh government spokesman said: \"It would be reasonable for members of Llanymynech Golf Club to enter or leave Wales within the confines of the golf course.\" "

People have seen me literally every single day lead the country's fight against Covid and I have literally spent almost every waking moment doing that.\n\"I will continue to do that for every single day that is required out of that crisis, because it is not over yet.\"\nBut she added: \"Recovery is not a neutral thing. \n\"So long as so many of the decisions lies in the hands of Boris Johnson and Westminster, then the danger is we take the wrong decisions and go in the wrong direction just as we've been dragged out of the EU against our will.\"\nThis debate was a reminder of the major fault line in Scottish politics - independence or continued union. \nMore than six years after the referendum, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed she is aiming to hold another vote in the first half of the next term at Holyrood.\nShe qualified that by saying this timescale depends on the Covid crisis being past but it's not clear how that will be determined.\nThe Greens also support indyref2 but avoided being tied down on timing. \nThe three other parties - Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats made their opposition to a referendum clear. \nBut the Tory leader Douglas Ross was determined to outdo the others, going as far as saying he did not want to work with the SNP because of independence. \nThat prompted Labour's Anas Sarwar to urge him to \"grow up\". \nThis election is not just a choice of first minister - there's also a lively debate between those for whom a strong second place finish would be a good result.\nBut Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the coronavirus vaccination programme showed the strength of the United Kingdom when it worked together. \nHe said more than half of all Scottish adults have now had their first does of vaccine, and added: \"The United Kingdom getting the vaccines that are delivered by our NHS staff, our British armed forces and volunteers. That's the union working for people right now.\"\nMr Ross asked: \"Why do we have bills in the Scottish Parliament to take forward another independence referendum, but not bills in the Scottish Parliament to support education, to help businesses, to protect jobs?\n\"None of that is happening because the Scottish government and the SNP are focused on another independence referendum.\"\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, voters in Scotland will elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of daily life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and benefits. Defence, foreign and immigration policies are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nMeanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar highlighted the case of a tertiary cancer patient who had been told she would not be treated in Scotland.\nMr Sarwar said this was because the backlog due to Covid meant operations were only being done on first cancers, and not recurring cancers, so the woman had to travel to England for treatment.\nHe said: \"That is what should be getting us exercised in this debate today. That is what we should be obsessing about, and that is what the recovery plan needs to be about.\n\"These are the things that matter to people across the country. They don't care about the badges or the name calling. They care about having services that work for them - what Scotland can do, not what Scotland can't do\". \nBut Ms Sturgeon's position was backed by Ms Slater, who said the Scottish Green manifesto would commit to a referendum taking place in the next Holyrood term.\nMs Slater said: \"Around the room we hear people who are in favour of the Union not actually arguing for the Union, but instead arguing that the people of Scotland shouldn't have the right to choose.\n\"The Scottish Greens would support a referendum in this term of parliament because we think decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people.\"\nMs Slater said the pandemic had shown that Scotland's economy was propped up by low wages, insecure work and a social security system that is full of holes.\nAnd she said science showed that the planet had less than a decade before the climate breakdown would go past the point of no return - and argued that we \"can't go back to this broken system\" after the pandemic.\nMr Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said more than 1,500 young people were having to wait more than a year for mental health support. \nAnd he said the pandemic had also highlighted the need to improve the country's care sector, and the lack of support for schoolchildren who had lost out on education. \nHe said: \"I've seen a window into the next five years in the last few weeks - arguments over the constitution, strategy about independence, arguments between Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond which have been poisonous and unpleasant.\n\"What we need to do is to put all of that behind us and choose a different future. \n\"And if we can do that we can tackle mental health, we can tackle education, but we can also make sure our social care workers get the pay they deserve.\"\nDo you have a question about the Scottish Parliament election?

      "title": "George Floyd: Teenage witness 'stays up apologising for not doing more'",
      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The teenager whose film of George Floyd's death sparked global protests said she \"stays up apologising\" to him for \"not doing more\".\nDarnella, now 18, was one of four young witnesses to take the stand on the second day of Derek Chauvin's trial. \nShe told the court of seeing Mr Floyd \"begging for his life\", comparing him to her dad, brother, cousins and uncles \"because they are all black\".\nIssues of racial equality and policing lie at the centre of the case.\nOn Monday, the opening session of the trial heard Mr Chauvin, an ex-police officer, knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for over nine minutes while arresting him in Minneapolis in May 2020. Prosecutors say this was a \"major cause\" in his death.\nDefence lawyers have indicated they will argue that 46-year-old Mr Floyd died of an overdose. Mr Chauvin, 45, denies charges of murder and manslaughter.\nThree other officers who were present - Tou Thao, J Alexander Keung and Thomas Lane - will go on trial later in the year.\nFour children who were all under 18 at the time of the incident gave evidence to the court, but the cameras were switched off so the jurors could not see them and they were identified only by their first names.\nDarnella, then 17 years old, was walking to the Cup Foods shop with her nine-year-old cousin when they came across the arrest on the street outside. \nShe told the court she started filming on her phone because \"I saw a man terrified, begging for his life. It wasn't right - he was in pain.\"\nShe described hearing Mr Floyd \"saying 'I can't breathe'. He was terrified, he was calling for his mom.\" \nDarnella said witnessing his death had changed her life.\n\"When I look at George Floyd I look at my dad, I look at my brother, my cousins, my uncles - because they are all black,\" she said, audibly crying. \"And I look at how that could have been one of them.\"\n\"I stay up apologising to George Floyd for not doing more.\"\nHer young cousin also gave evidence and said she felt \"sad and kind of mad\" by what she saw. \"It sounded like he was hurting\".\nTwo friends, Alissa, 18, and Kalen, 17, had driven up to the store when they came across the arrest. Both described feeling helpless as they watched Mr Floyd's last moments before \"he was just laying there, no longer fighting or resisting\".\nThe last witness of the day was Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter, who said the officers prevented her from administering medical help that would have saved Mr Floyd's life. She was rebuked by the judge for her testy responses to defence questioning.\nOne witness, Donald Williams II, who is trained in mixed martial arts, was questioned for over an hour by the prosecution and defence on Monday and again on Tuesday.\nHe told the court Mr Chauvin had used a dangerous technique called a \"blood choke\" and was moving his knee back and forth to increase the pressure on Mr Floyd's back and neck.\nHe rejected defence suggestions that he and other bystanders' interactions with police had been threatening to the officers there. \nIn opening statements on Monday, Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told the jury that Mr Chauvin had \"betrayed his badge\" by kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck, and using \"excessive and unreasonable force\" to detain him.\nMeanwhile, Mr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson said the case was about the evidence, not about a \"political or social cause\". He said Mr Floyd had ingested drugs at the time of his arrest \"in an effort to conceal them to police\", and suggested this contributed to his death.\nMr Chauvin has been silent but remained engaged during the proceedings, taking almost constant notes on a yellow legal pad while listening to the evidence.\nDarnella's video footage of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck was replayed the world over and sparked mass protests and a racial reckoning in the US.\nTo many, Floyd's death while in police custody became a vivid symbol of police brutality - particularly against people of colour - and it sparked worldwide demonstrations for racial justice.\nBut despite the global outcry this is not an open and shut case. In the US, police are rarely convicted for deaths that occur while they are on duty, if they are charged at all.\nThe verdict in this case will be widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system treats deaths that occur while in police custody."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Rural life,Pubs,Broadband,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Irish pubs could be turned into remote working hubs under a post-pandemic plan to give rural villages a new lease on life. \nThe Irish government scheme is part of a five year rural development policy, released on Monday.\nUnder the plan, a fifth of public servants would shift to remote or home working by the end of the year.\nThe government says it is an invitation to remote workers to live in rural Ireland. \nIt will also introduce legislation this year to give employees the right to request to work remotely.\nThe Irish government's Our Rural Future strategy proposes a national network of 400 remote working hubs, including ones specifically for the public sector. \nIt is the first European country to come up with such a plan. \nRural and Community Development Minister Heather Humphreys said it was \"the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural Ireland in decades\".\n\"As we emerge from Covid-19, the new policy is about maximising a recovery for all parts of the country and giving a better quality of life to people who live and work in rural areas.\"\nConcern about the pre-eminence of Dublin and the need for decentralisation of civil service jobs is a perennial theme in Irish political discourse.\nA previous attempt to move government departments outside of the capital was a failure.\nCivil servants who had bought homes and had children at school in the city were very reluctant to sell-up to move to areas where they may have had no connections.\nBut this time the government is hoping it will be different because the focus will be more on individuals than on civil service departments.\nAnd the pandemic experience of working from home has proved there is such an appetite.\nBut to work broadband speeds in rural areas will need to improve from all too often very slow to superfast - just one of the many challenges the government faces as it looks to a future beyond the pandemic.\nThe report commits to \"explore the potential to develop a pilot scheme to support the use of rural pubs as community spaces and hubs for local services\".\nThe minister likened it to the UK's \"the hub in the pub\" concept. \n\"We are teasing out how, maybe, pubs can be used for different purposes during the day,\" she said. \n\"It could be working spaces. It could be community spaces. It could be many different things and we can look at having high-speed broadband there.\"\nCork South West TD (Irish MP) Michael Collins said such a plan would need high-speed, reliable broadband - which his constituents did not always have, Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported. \nAs part of the new strategy, the government has proposed investing up to \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) in the roll-out of the national broadband plan.\n\"There are huge issues. Many people have come back from the cities to work in rural communities and the broadband is shocking. \n\"I have hundreds and hundreds of people in west Cork pulling their hair out of their heads because they can't get broadband in their homes.\"\nNorthern Ireland's civil service is currently developing an \"enduring\" remote-working policy with trade unions. \nIn February, the Department of Finance announced 10 regional hubs for public sector workers.\nThe Cross Border Workers Coalition welcomed the commitment of ministers \"north and south\" to remote working. \nHowever \"restrictive\" cross border tax rules continued to leave rural communities behind, the organisation's co-chair Aidan O'Kane said.\n\"Under current legislation, cross border workers who live in the Republic of Ireland and work for an Northern Ireland-based company can face a 'double tax' on their income if they work remotely. \n\"Employees should be able to live in towns across the island regardless of where their job is based.\"\nThe Irish government has included a tax review for remote workers and employers as part of its strategy.

The other two are allegations of perjury in 2016.\nIf convicted on the first six charges, which she denies, she would face up to 35 years in prison.\nMs Maxwell, the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, was in a relationship with financier Epstein in the 1990s. She allegedly introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family.\nEpstein killed himself in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\nEarlier this month, Ms Maxwell's brother Ian Maxwell told BBC News his sister, who was arrested last year, was being held in \"degrading\" conditions in jail in Brooklyn.  \nGloria Allred, a lawyer representing alleged victims, told the BBC that bail should be \"out of the question\" as it \"would be very upsetting to the victims\"."

      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Michelle O'Neill,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The attendance of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill at the funeral of Bobby Storey in June led to the biggest crisis in NI politics since devolution was restored in January.\nMs O'Neill and other senior Sinn F\u00e9in figures were widely criticised for attending the funeral, with claims they broke coronavirus guidelines.\nA decision was later made by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone in connection with the funeral.\nHere is how the crisis unfolded.\nThe north Belfast man was considered the head of intelligence of the IRA for a period from the mid-1990s - being named as such under parliamentary privilege.\nSecurity sources linked him to several major incidents, including the \u00a326m Northern Bank robbery in 2004.\nMore recently, he was northern chairman of Sinn F\u00e9in.\nHe spent more than 20 years in jail, beginning with internment without trial when he was 17, a year after he joined the IRA in 1972.\nIn 1981, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for possession of a rifle following an attack on the Army.\nHe was a close and lifelong ally of former Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams.\nWhen he was released from jail in 1994, Mr Storey was seen as a key individual in selling the peace process to republican hardliners.\nMr Storey's coffin was driven from his home in west Belfast for his funeral at St Agnes' Church on the Andersonstown Road.\nLarge numbers of people lined the route and the cortege was followed at a distance by a large number of mourners.\nAfter Requiem Mass, Mr Storey's remains were taken to Milltown Cemetery where speeches were made by senior republican figures including former Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams.\nHis body was then taken to Roselawn Cemetery in east Belfast, where it was cremated at about 15:30.\nMs O'Neill was part of the funeral cortege, which Sinn F\u00e9in said included no more than 30 people,\nCritics have suggested social distancing was not maintained in crowds that lined the streets as the hearse drove by or by large groups of people who walked behind the hearse at a greater distance.\nMs O'Neill also went to a Requiem Mass in St Agnes' Church in Andersonstown, which the BBC understands was attended by about 120 people.\nShe was also criticised for posing for a photograph at Milltown cemetery, where a man had his arm around her shoulders.\nShe subsequently said this incident took place \"in the blink of an eye\" and \"shouldn't have happened\".\nCritics were angry the deputy first minister, who appealed to the public during the pandemic to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, has now contravened the very rules she helped set.\nImmediately following the funeral, both the party and Ms O'Neill maintained they acted within the guidelines at all times and broke no rules.\nIn statements to the Irish News and Stormont's Executive Committee, she did not apologise for any of her actions, with the exception of the photograph. \nSinn F\u00e9in gave her its full backing, saying she would not stand down \"under any circumstances\".\nMs O'Neill later issued a statement expressing concern for families of those who had died in the pandemic whose grief would have been compounded by lockdown restrictions.\n\"Not being able to have their family and friends' support to help them through was hugely difficult,\" she said.\n\"I am also concerned that those grieving families are experiencing more hurt over recent days. I am sorry for that.\"\nShe reiterated that she had kept to the rules, adding: \"If the regulations had prevented me from attending his funeral I would have obeyed those regulations.\"\nHer party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told RT\u00c9: \"I do understand that looking at the images of very busy pathways in west Belfast and taking all of that in obviously has jolted and has caused some hurt among some of those families, and for that I am very sorry.\n\"That certainly would never have been my intention, or Michelle's intention, or the intention of the Storey family as they laid Bobby to rest.\"\nIn September, Ms O'Neill acknowledged Stormont's public health messaging was \"undermined\" by the controversy.\nFollowing the announcement in March 2021 that nobody would be prosecuted in relation to the funeral, she apologised again \"for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief\".\nNorthern Ireland's system of government sees five parties share power in government together - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Alliance.\nImmediately following the funeral all the other parties called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside while investigations are carried out.\nThe Green Party and Traditional Unionist Voice, which are not part of the government, also called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside. \nFirst Minister Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, said she could not stand beside Ms O'Neill to give out public health advice after what had happened.\nThe two women had been at the forefront of regular press conferences to update the people of Northern Ireland on the handling of the coronavirus crisis.\nThey did not give a joint press conference again until September, after Ms O'Neill admitted her actions had undermined the health messaging.\nThe Public Prosecution Service took a decision on 30 March not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral.\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over attendance at the funeral.\nHe set out a number of reasons behind the decision not to prosecute.\nAmong these, he said was that a \"lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police\" would \"pose an insurmountable difficulty\" if prosecutions were brought.\nMrs Foster called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign as a result, saying his position was now \"untenable\".\nMr Byrne said he would not resign and added that no deals were done with the organisers of the funeral.\nLockdown regulations stated a maximum of 30 people were allowed to gather together outdoors.\nThe regulations, as they were in place on the day of the funeral, also stated that people can leave their homes to attend the funeral of a friend if no close family member or member of their household is attending.\nPeople were allowed to leave their home to \"visit a burial ground to pay respects to a member of your household or your family member of a friend\".\nA number of Mr Storey's family attended his funeral.\nThe regulations said if anyone had to leave their home they should maintain a distance of at least 1m from anyone outside their household.\nAn independent investigation was launched into Mr Storey's cremation at Roselawn Cemetery, which is run by Belfast City Council.\nIt had been claimed that some council staff were allowed to go home early, leaving republicans largely in control of what took place.\nThe report, published in February 2021, found Sinn F\u00e9in did not pressurise the council to give his family special treatment.\nIt also rejected suggestions there had been a \"takeover\" of Roselawn cemetery.\nIn addition, questions were also raised over why a large crowd gathered at Milltown Cemetery in west Belfast for speeches by Sinn F\u00e9in politicians when the cremation happened at Roselawn in east Belfast.\nMilltown Cemetery is a significant location for republicans, and contains the graves of a number of high-profile republicans, including Bobby Sands.\nLarge crowds are a common feature at funerals of high profile republicans.\nDuring the Troubles, tens of thousands of people turned out for the funerals of IRA members who had been killed.\nFunerals often feature common elements, such as a piper, while the coffin is draped in the Irish flag.\nAccording to political commentator Chris Donnelly, these types of funerals \"demonstrate a commitment to pursue the cause\" of Irish unification, as well as allowing mourners to grieve and pay their respects.\n\"So a funeral almost is an occasion to express gratitude, renew commitment and the passing of the torch all rolled up into one,\" he said."

      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,Michelle O'Neill,Police Service of Northern Ireland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's first minister has called on the PSNI's chief constable to resign after it was announced there would be no prosecutions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey.\nArlene Foster said Simon Byrne's position was now \"untenable\".\nThe funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. \nThe actions of 24 Sinn F\u00e9in politicians were examined, including Ms O'Neill.\nMr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had formerly been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s.\nThe attendance of many senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians at his funeral in west Belfast, at a time when strict limits on gatherings were in place, caused a political furore.\nA police file has been with the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) since December.\nMr Byrne said on Tuesday afternoon that he would not resign and that the force has policed impartially. \nThe first minister said she telephoned Mr Byrne and told him to resign. She said she regretted his decision not to, and that she would be speaking to Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis later. \nMeanwhile, it has been confirmed that the Stormont Assembly will be recalled from Easter recess to debate a motion of censure against Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIt follows a recall petition proposed by the SDLP and supported by the DUP, UUP, Alliance and Green Party. A recall petition requires signatures of 30 MLAs in order to be successful.\nThe assembly is currently in recess until 12 April, but the SDLP had argued Sinn F\u00e9in ministers should be held to account through assembly procedures, following political criticism  after the PPS' decision. \nIt is understood MLAs have been told by the Speaker Alex Maskey that the assembly will be recalled on Thursday 1 April at 12:00.\nOn Tuesday, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over attendance at the funeral. \nBut he added the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 had become \"extremely difficult to navigate\" because of various amendments, and were in some respects \"inconsistent\".\nHe added organisers of the funeral and the police had engaged against \"the backdrop of evolving regulations\". \nThis was done, Mr Herron said, to ensure a balance was struck in the funeral arrangements \"between respecting the sensitivity of the occasion and minimising any risk to both public health and safety\".\n\"Prosecutions can only be brought where the available evidence provides a reasonable prospect of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, a breach of the criminal law.\"\nHe added: \"As a result of the factors considered we have concluded that the prosecution could not prove any breach of the regulations to the required standard.\"\nMr Herron said the \"lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police\" would \"pose an insurmountable difficulty\" if prosecutions were brought. \n\"This is because they could all avail of a defence of reasonable excuse in terms of their actual or reasonably perceived compliance with a complex set of regulations and/or their reliance on the prior engagement with PSNI,\" he added. \n\"The law as it applied to the Storey funeral was changed significantly on the evening before the funeral and further amended two days later.\"\nMr Herron said the law relating to permissible conduct in the course of the pandemic was \"not always clear cut and this can be challenging when it comes to enforcement of what are essentially health regulations in a criminal justice context\".\nMrs Foster said it was a bad day for justice, policing, and the rule of law. \nShe said the engagement between the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the funeral organisers was a factor in no prosecutions being made.\n\"The position of the chief constable is now untenable and I am calling on him to resign.  Sadly, it is now clear confidence cannot be rebuilt with him in post.\"\nShe said there was a crisis of confidence in policing.\n\"I think this is the most bizarre situation we have found ourselves in Northern Ireland in quite some time,\" she said. \nMrs Foster said Sinn F\u00e9in had acted as though the party was above the law. \n\"To claim ignorance of the law is no defence when you helped legislate those very same regulations,\" she said. \n\"Hundreds lined the streets dressed in white shirts and black ties and attended a political rally in Milltown Cemetery when the limit on public gatherings was 30. \n\"There was a complete lapse of leadership and a public display of arrogance by Sinn F\u00e9in's elected representatives. Public health rules were undermined and irreparably damaged.\"\nSimon Byrne can soldier on if he wants to soldier on - but if he does, how can he rebuild the unionist community's confidence in him?\nThat confidence was at a pretty low ebb even before today's PPS decision. \nThere is a meeting of the Policing Board on Thursday and I'm hearing from DUP sources that this is something they're not going to drop quickly, even if Mr Byrne has made it clear that he's not for quitting. \nWe need to remind ourselves that it is not unusual for the PSNI to engage with individuals ahead of large-scale events, and this funeral is no exception. \nWhat a lot of people within unionism are struggling to comprehend is a full understanding of what went on in those conversations to such an extent that it has compromised a prosecution. \nThere may be momentum growing for a further investigation, maybe though the Police Ombudsman, to get to the bottom of what went on before the funeral. \nIt is bizarre, though, that we're in a situation where the PSNI is taking a lot of flack and the PPS has simply issued a statement. \nIt was the PPS which reached this decision - a decision the PSNI has been at pains to say it disagrees with - and the police have found themselves on a hiding to nothing. \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she wanted to once again apologise \"for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief\".\n\"Nine months ago I laid my dear friend Bobby Storey to rest. I accept and understand that many people, particularly those who had lost loved ones during the last year, felt that by my actions, I gave the impression that the rules did not apply to us all equally. Let me say clearly they do,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"No funeral is more important than any other. No family or community is any more important than any other. All grief is devastating.\"\nMeanwhile, Justice Minister Naomi Long said she did not agree with the call for Mr Byrne's resignation. \nShe said he was being used as a \"lightening rod\" for people's anger. \n\"I don't believe it is the chief constable's fault that we have found ourselves in this position,\" she said. \n\"It is wrong that we should direct our anger towards him and the police.\"\nShe also said it was not the fault of the PPS. \nMr Byrne said enforcing the coronavirus regulations has been a \"consistently challenging and often uncomfortable role for my officers\".\nHe said police did recommend prosecutions in the case. \n\"The PPS decision points to the ambiguity and changing nature of the coronavirus regulations in force immediately before and on the day of the funeral which, in their view alone, amounted to an insurmountable hurdle to a successful prosecution,\" he said. \n\"The decision not to prosecute does not change our view that what happened last summer when large numbers of people chose not to 'stay at home' at the height of a global pandemic was unnecessary, irresponsible and insensitive. It was wrong.\"\nThe chief constable said that if he was to resign, it would undermine his successor.\n\"Sometimes decisions don't go the way people want,\" he said. \n\"Public servants need to be held to account, yes, but every time something doesn't go the way of somebody's point of view, and if we have to resign, there's no continuity.\"\nMr Byrne said no deals were done with the organisers of the funeral. \n\"We did not turn a blind eye,\" he added. \nThe Policing Board said it would have an opportunity to question Mr Byrne at its meeting on Thursday. \nThe police investigation into suspected breaches of pandemic regulations began in July, with Mark Webster, the deputy chief constable of Cumbria Police, providing independent oversight.\nIt is understood all of those interviewed were Sinn F\u00e9in politicians. \nTwo people are facing prosecution in connection with attendance at the funeral of former Sinn F\u00e9in councillor Francie McNally in mid-Ulster in April 2020.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has joined more than 20 world leaders in calling for a new global settlement to help the world prepare for future pandemics. \nIn a newspaper article the leaders, including the German chancellor and French president, said Covid posed the biggest challenge since World War Two.\nThe pandemic has shown \"nobody is safe until everyone is safe\", they said.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the UK would need a surplus of vaccines before it could export supplies.\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph and publications such as Le Monde in France and El Pais in Spain, the 24 leaders argue that a treaty similar to that reached in the wake of World War Two is needed to build cross-border cooperation.\nThe signatories, who include the head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: \"At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. \n\"The aims were clear: To bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism, and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation - namely peace, prosperity, health and security.\"\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the other leaders said that in the same spirit, countries must now \"be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion\". \nA new treaty would help to establish better systems for alerting people about potential pandemics, they said, while also improving the sharing of data and distribution of vaccines and personal protective equipment.\n\"There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone. The question is not if, but when. \n\"The Covid-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.\"\nThe letter added: \"At a time when Covid-19 has exploited our weaknesses and divisions, we must seize this opportunity and come together as a global community for peaceful co-operation that extends beyond this crisis.\"\nDr David Nabarro, a special envoy on Covid-19 for the WHO, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that without \"some kind of special action, the world as a whole will not be vaccinated until well into 2022\".\n\"During that time all sorts of problems with variants will emerge, and so all that leaders are saying is 'this problem is so huge we've got to work together to deal with it',\" he added.\nWhile the concept of an international vaccine treaty suggests cosy cooperation, elsewhere there is quite the battle going on between the signatories of this letter over the issue of the blueprints to the new vaccines.\nSouth Africa and India are leading dozens of mainly developing countries seeking a temporary pandemic waiver to global rules protecting the technology and recipes for Covid vaccines. \nWithout these rules, they say they have the capacity to manufacture more vaccine doses.\nOver the past few months, wealthier countries including the UK, the US and the EU have repeatedly blocked a waiver. \nThe argument is that the pharmaceutical companies have performed well in getting a vaccine into arms within a year, and need to be able to have the incentive of making money out of this innovation in years to come.\nThe drugs companies say the bottleneck is not the patents, but the ability to manufacture globally. \nThe big unknown factors here are suggestions that the Biden administration might be about to change sides in this battle for vaccines.\nThat would mark a stunning change, and leave the UK and the EU under pressure to change tack, or at least to put more flesh on the bones of the goal of this treaty - that the pandemic will not be over until it is over for everyone.\nMr Kwarteng told the programme that making vaccines available to other counties \"can happen once we have a surplus of vaccines here in the UK\".\n\"There's still a way to go. We've got to make sure we do everything we can deal with the pandemic and coronavirus in this country,\" he said.\n\"But obviously we want to work in the spirit of co-operation as well, and when we do have surpluses we'll be looking to export those, I'm sure.\"\nThe joint article comes in the wake of disagreement between the UK and the EU over vaccines, after the bloc introduced tougher export controls on jabs produced there.\nThe UK and the World Health Organization warned against blockades, while the EU blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering promised doses. \nAstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract.\nAt a Downing Street briefing on Monday, Mr Johnson announced that tens of millions of doses of the Novavax vaccine would now be produced and packaged in north-east England.\nThe prime minister said a deal had been agreed with GlaxoSmithKline to bottle 60 million doses at its facility in Barnard Castle.\nThe original plan was for the \"fill and finish\" process - by which vaccines are packaged up in vials - to be done in Europe.\nNovavax is currently being assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.\nAlso at the briefing, the PM said the UK did not know \"exactly how strong\" its defences against another wave of Covid would be despite its \"impressive\" vaccine rollout. \nHe was speaking as the stay-at-home rule came to an end in England, allowing groups to meet outdoors. Outdoor sport facilities, including swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses, have reopened, while weddings are also on again.\nMr Johnson warned more deaths, infections and hospitalisations were inevitable as the UK comes out of lockdown.\nBut he also said he could not \"see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the road map\" of easing further restrictions.\nFrom 12 April, shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality will reopen in England, if strict conditions are met.\nA further 4,654 Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Monday, compared with 5,342 cases a week ago. \nThere were another 23 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive test, compared with 17 on the same day last week.\nThe latest figures show 293,542 UK adults received a first dose of the vaccine on Sunday, taking the overall number to 30,444,829 - with 146,785 having their second dose, bringing that total to 3,674,266."

      "tags": "Dogs,Lady Gaga",
      "text": "Lady Gaga's dog walker Ryan Fischer says he has had part of his lung removed after being shot in the chest by a dognapper in Los Angeles.\nMr Fischer described how he had been making a \"remarkably fast\" recovery when his lung collapsed and he had to have surgery.\nHe is now out of hospital and at home.\nMr Fischer was walking the singer's three French bulldogs in Hollywood in February when he was confronted by a man carrying a semi-automatic handgun.\nThe gunman shot Mr Fischer and he and an accomplice took two of the dogs, Koji and Gustav. A third bulldog, named Miss Asia, ran away and was later recovered by police.\nThe stolen dogs were returned unharmed a few days later by a woman - apparently uninvolved in the incident - who handed them into a Los Angeles police station.\nPolice have yet to identify any suspects.\nMr Fischer wrote in a lengthy Instagram post that his initial recovery looked positive.\n\"With the chest tube removed (which I can only equate to an alien baby extraction) and my blood oxygen stable, the journey outside to recover with loved ones began.\"\nHowever,  he then began to experience \"strange hissing and glugging coming from my chest every time I took a breath\".\n\"It became quite clear that my lung was not healing,\" he went on to say, \"and the bullet wound had scarred my tissue like a burn\".\nWhen he was wheeled into surgery to have portions of his lung removed, he said he had \"finally accepted my recovery had become anything but a straight line\".\nHe ended his post by saying: \"The journey is hard, it's assuredly painful, and questionable choices that no longer serve me like wearing skinny jeans are made. But I try. And somewhere within that I find the absurdity and wonder and beauty this life offers us all.\"\nLady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, was in Rome working on a new Ridley Scott film, Gucci, when her dogs were stolen.\nAt the time she called Mr Fischer a \"hero\" who risked his life \"to fight for our family\".\nShe offered a $500,000 (\u00a3359,282) reward to anyone who would return the dogs; it is not clear if this was handed over to the woman who brought the pets in.\nIt was also not clear if the dogs were targeted because of Lady Gaga's celebrity status, or whether it was a chance - or planned - attack, because of the prized and valuable breed of dog involved."

      "text": "A drug used in attacks by the UK's most prolific rapist and the serial killer Stephen Port will be reclassified.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said GHB would move from a Class C to a Class B drug - the same as speed or cannabis.\nAnnouncing the news, Ms Patel said it would mean tougher penalties for those found with it in their possession.\nIt follows a recommendation last year by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD).\nThe three categories of drugs are Class A, Class B and Class C - with heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD in class A, and speed, cannabis, ketamine, mephedrone and some amphetamines in Class B.\nCurrently GHB is in Class C, with anabolic steroids and some tranquilisers.\nMs Patel said that \"GHB and related substances have been used to commit some truly sickening crimes including murder, sexual assault and robbery\".\n\"I will do everything in my power to protect people from harm, which is why I am tightening restrictions around these dangerous substances,\" she said.\nThe Home Office said associated substances GBL and 1,4-BD - which convert to GHB in the body - would also be moved into Class B.\nIt added that, in future, the law would require a licence for anyone wishing to possess the associated substances for \"legitimate\" purposes.\nGBL, a colourless liquid that is sold as an industrial cleaner, is only classed as a controlled narcotic when knowingly intended for human consumption.\nLast year's ACMD review also recommended changes in education about the drug's impact, data collection on its use, and treatment and support for those at risk.\nTesting for GHB and related compounds should become routine in cases of unexplained sudden death, the report also advised.\nThe government has yet to commit to these other recommendations.\nA Home Office spokeswoman said they would be \"considered in due course\".\nThe review was commissioned following calls for a change in the law by the children of a man who was murdered with the drug.\nEric Michels, a father of three from south London, was killed in 2018 by a GHB dealer who gave him a catastrophic overdose in order to steal from him.\nHis sons Sam and Josh campaigned for the drug to be reclassified.\nSam Michels told the BBC: \"We are pleased to know that this awful drug has finally been recognised for the real dangers it poses\", adding that, \"while we still intend to push reclassification to Class A, moving to Class B is a considerable step forward\".\nHe expressed disappointment at the government's current \"lack of dedication\" to testing for GHB following unexplained sudden deaths, but said \"we will continue to work\" on the issue to ensure there is clear evidence on the number of related deaths.\nGHB was the weapon of choice for Reynhard Sinaga, the most prolific rapist in UK history, and Stephen Port, the deadliest serial killer of the last decade.\nPolice believe that Sinaga, from Manchester, had over 200 victims. He was jailed last year after being convicted of 159 sexual offences.\nPort murdered four young men in east London between 2014 and 2015 by giving them overdoses of GHB.\nGHB, which was designated a Class C drug in 2003, usually comes as a powder that is dissolved in water.\nThe drug can lead to feelings of euphoria in very small doses, but in only slightly larger amounts can cause unconsciousness and death.\nIt is often implicated in sexual offences - as a so-called 'date rape' drug - and also in cases of theft."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nVaccinations and infections mean that about half of the people in the UK now have antibodies against Covid-19, according to tests carried out by the Office for National Statistics. Antibodies are proteins in the blood which recognise specific infections and fight them off. With 30 million people having received at least one dose, most of the protection has been acquired through vaccination. Among over-65s, who have been prioritised for the vaccine, about 90% have antibodies. There has been a small decline in detectable antibodies among this group since January, however. The ONS suggests this may be because some people had their first dose but had not received their second yet - but it stressed that doesn't mean they have less immunity.\nScotland is ending its \"stay at home\" lockdown order on Friday and urging people to stay local instead, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. People will still be asked to remain within their local authority area until 26 April, when the travel ban within Scotland is lifted. Hairdressers, barbers, garden centres, homeware stores and click-and-collect services will also be allowed to reopen from Monday. The ending of the stay-at-home order follows similar moves in Wales earlier in March and yesterday in England. Conservatives in Wales have said they hope to end social distancing altogether on 21 June if they win May's Senedd elections.\nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says further investigation is needed to rule out a theory that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in China. Although such a leak is the least likely cause, more extensive research is needed, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The virus was first detected in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in late 2019, but the Chinese government has dismissed the allegations of a virus leak. An international team of experts travelled to the city in January to probe the origin of the virus but Dr Tedros said they had difficulty accessing raw data and called for \"more timely and comprehensive data sharing\" in the future.\nJust one day after restrictions in England were eased to allow up to six people or two households to gather outdoors, police put in place a dispersal order to prevent large crowds gathering in Nottingham Arboretum. Videos shared on social media showed people brawling, hugging and drinking while enjoying the warm weather. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, First Minister Arlene Foster has called for the PSNI's chief constable to resign after it was announced there would be no prosecutions following the attendance of 2,000 mourners - against Covid restrictions - at the funeral of former IRA head of intelligence Bobby Storey.\nThe organiser of the Leeds and Reading festivals has said he is confident they will go ahead in August - but fans will \"almost certainly\" need some form of Covid vaccination passport. Melvin Benn said he was taking the prime minister at his word that legal restrictions would be removed in June for a \"summer of fun\". Headline acts announced so far include Stormzy, Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age. But Mr Benn said if the dual-site festival does have to be cancelled, fans will receive a refund.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you want to know what rules have been relaxed, and what changes are expected next, you can find all the details here.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Women's rights,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "Maintaining public order at protests is one of the hardest jobs in modern policing. If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe. \nBut when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in. \nSunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head. \nBut the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control. \nThe question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing. \nEarlier in the week it became increasingly clear that people up and down the UK wanted to hold vigils for Sarah Everard. \nWomen in London, organising under the Reclaim These Streets banner, approached Met commanders for their help in setting up a vigil on Clapham Common in south London, close to where Ms Everard was last seen alive. \nThe police said a demo would be illegal under the coronavirus lockdown regulations. \nAnd so the women and their lawyers asked the High Court to make a declaration that would force the police to think again.\nThe problem is that the law is not that clear cut. \nFor almost a year, the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and the public grasping for answers as to what is possible in public. It's so complex we've even seen people fined for walking while holding a cup of tea. \nGatherings in public are generally banned in England but, at the same time, the rules recognise there are \"reasonable excuses\" to be outside.\nBut the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses.\nNo matter what the Covid regulations say, there is an overarching right to freedom of expression that is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. That means the police have a legal duty to help make safe protests possible. \nBut that right is not an absolute trump card - it can be interfered with if the police can show they have good reason to stop an event happening. \nAnd after hours of difficult legal argument on Friday, the judge refused to intervene and basically told the two sides to work it out for themselves with all those legal principles in mind. \nIn the absence of further legal clarity, the organisers claimed victory. They said the police had to now negotiate a sensible well-run vigil. \nThen, the police pushed back hard. They said they too had been vindicated. They could not authorise a potentially unlimited demonstration that would become an enormous Covid-spreading event. Stay at home, they said. \nBy Saturday morning, the organisers abandoned their plans amid a very serious risk they could each face a \u00a310,000 fine for organising a lockdown-breaking gathering. \nBut by that point, it was inevitable that people would turn up at Clapham Common, whether or not there was going to be a public event. It was the talk of social media. \nSo given that racing certainty, and the lack of official marshals that Reclaim These Streets said they would have provided had the police agreed to a vigil, what was the police's plan to keep people safe?  \nThe turning point in Scotland Yard's tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, around 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear. \nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: \"At this point, officers on the ground were faced with a very difficult decision. \n\"Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.\"\nAnd so, they tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people whom they believed were contributing to the crowding. \nPatsy Stevenson, the red-haired woman caught on camera being handcuffed on the ground at the bandstand, received a \u00a3200 Covid fine as police tried to remove her from the area. \nShe has not been accused of, or charged with, violence - but was there any elsewhere? \nThere was definitely a lot of anger - with some of the crowd chanting obscenities at the police at one point. \nThe Metropolitan Police Federation, representing frontline officers, says 26 of them were assaulted yesterday at Clapham - punched, kicked and spat at.\nPictures obtained by the Press Association clearly show three instances of officers being forcibly pushed and a van's wing mirror being deliberately vandalised. Guess what? All three instances involved men, not women. \nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball has said the Met did not want to be in the position where it had to turn to enforcement. But what's not clear is why this demonstration was considered to be so much more of a Covid risk than others that commanders couldn't find a way to make it possible. \nPolice forces elsewhere in the UK were waiting for a lead from the Met. But those that saw DIY vigils - albeit far smaller ones - appeared to take a stand-back approach. \nThe better comparison is Black Lives Matter last summer, when there were large crowds in London and elsewhere that were clearly not socially distancing. \nWhy the difference? That, and other questions about how the operation unfolded, may have been answered in the report that's been sent to Home Secretary Priti Patel. \nShe's now asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out its own external review of the event - and what Ms Patel ultimately concludes may dictate whether Dame Cressida survives calls for her to go.\nWhile the commissioner is accountable to the Mayor of London, who has raised his own serious concerns after a meeting with Dame Cressida, the Home Secretary is jointly responsible for deciding who gets the job - and when they should go.\nDame Cressida is highly respected both in policing and government - far more so than some of her predecessors - but she remains a controversial figure for many others.  \nShe commanded the 2005 operation that led to the shooting dead of Jean Charles De Menezes, after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber - although a jury exonerated her of any personal wrongdoing. \nMore recently, she called for better powers to deal with Extinction Rebellion's repeated occupations of parts of London. The government agreed - and the home secretary's proposals to greatly expand the police's ability to curtail demonstrations goes before Parliament on Monday. \nAsk most police officers who have experience of covering public protests, and they will tell you they often feel - individual mistakes besides - it is a no-win situation when things go wrong. (Just last week I was talking about this very dilemma on BBC Newscast.)\nIt would be something of a terrible twist of fate for the commissioner - the first woman in the post - to lose her job in these circumstances.

They haven't seen their friends for months so it's really nice for them to be together.\n\"We had a few concerns [about numbers] but we knew Rhyl would be a bit quieter, hence we came to this destination.\"\nJess Hope-Jones, who runs an ice cream parlour in Hay-on-Wye, Powys, said: \"I feel like we're quite well-practised at opening and closing now, as it's happened a lot over the last year. \n\"We're fairly well set up for takeaway and well-practised with all of our measures so we feel safe and secure and I think everyone's happy to be back welcoming our customers again.\n\"Saturday was lovely, really great vibe in Hay, lots of people around.\n\"Sunday was a bit quieter so I think that it's not the full-on Easter holidays that we might expect where we have lots of people staying.\n\"I think it was lots of day-trippers or people who've not come too far, but that will probably change\u2026 when England comes on holiday, hopefully by the 12th people might be able to cross the border and come in.\"\nIn Carmarthenshire, the car park next to Laugharne's castle was full.\nIn Cardiff, Regina Ritsch, the manager of Pettigrews Tea Rooms in Bute Park, earlier said she hoped they would have a busy day.\n\"We've had lots of families out, lots of walkers, lots of dog walkers, especially with the weather being nice,\" she said.\nShe said people had been \"really good\" at distancing and wearing masks.\n\"People have been sticking to the restrictions and just being really aware of everything and really good at keeping their social distance from other people as well,\" she added.\nHelen Pritchard, who was visiting the seafront at Aberystwyth with her son's partner Annie Jones and her grandson Reggie,  said there was nothing like the seaside to \"lift your spirits\".\n\"I think we all need a bit of spirits being lifted at the moment,\" she said.\n\"We planned it at the weekend because we knew the weather was going to be good and as Annie is a teacher she's now on Easter holidays.\"\nMs Jones added: \"It's so nice to have a break and just get out in the sunshine and move around.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

In some states, including Georgia and Arizona, the over-16s are now able to get a jab, according to the New York Times.\nMr Biden urged Americans in the meantime to adhere to guidelines on social distancing and face coverings.\n\"Fight to the finish,\" he said. \"Don't let up now.\""

      "text": "The first vaccination has been delivered after the SSE Arena in Belfast opened as a mass vaccination centre on Monday.\nUp to 1,850 vaccines are due to be administered at the venue on Monday.\nCentre vaccine manager Tanya Daly said seeing the centre in operation was \"an amazing sight\".\nUp to 40,000 people could be vaccinated each week at the arena, where the AstraZeneca jab will be used.\nPatricia Donnelly, the head of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, told BBC Newsline \"it was like waiting for Christmas\" and was a \"momentous day for everyone concerned\".\n\"We have got a very steady supply of AstraZeneca which is going to be used in this centre (SSE Arena) and also Pfizer which is used in other centres,\" she added.\n\"That steady supply has not let us down at any stage.\"\nMs Donnelly said that at the SSE Arena there was the capacity for 40,000 people to be vaccinated a week, but it would start with 10,000 a week.\n\"We build up over time, as we get more vaccine,\" she said.\nA Covid-19 vaccination scheme at community pharmacies in Northern Ireland was also launched on Monday.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said this would speed up the existing vaccination programme and ease access for people who may struggle to travel to a mass vaccination centre.\nSpeaking from the SSE Arena, where 16 vaccinators are working a 12-hour shift, Ms Daly told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme: \"We are delighted that it is working so well.\n\"It's a fantastic team.\"\nMs Daly said the SSE Arena was not the clinical environment that staff were used to at the Ulster Hospital but that everything had been replicated to the same standards on a larger scale.\nStringent controls and procedures are in place and all staff have received rigorous theoretical and practical training, she said.\n\"We want people to have a good experience, but we want it to be safe,\" she said. \n\"We want to be sure that our vaccinators are not put under pressure; that the right questions are being asked and that everybody gets the vaccine that's appropriate.\"\nHealth officials plan to operate the vaccination service at the SSE Arena up to 14 hours a day, seven days a week.\nFree car parking and shuttle bus services are being offered to people travelling to the arena for their jab.\nGary Davidson, 55, from east Belfast, received the first jab after 08:00 BST.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the opening of the centre was a \"significant milestone\" in the rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme.\nShe said the number of people vaccinated would \"rise significantly in the coming weeks\".\nMaggie Magowan, lead nurse at the South Eastern Trust vaccination centre, said it was a \"monumental day\".\n\"I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get booked in to help protect themselves, their families and our community,\" she said.\nChief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene said pharmacies were \"delighted to be playing their part\" in the vaccination programme and their inclusion showed the \"major progress\" that is being made.\nAbout 343 pharmacies in Northern Ireland are currently taking part.\nIn Northern Ireland, vaccines are available to people aged 50 or over.\nThose who are eligible can book an appointment online, by phone on 0300 200 7813 or they may be contacted by their GP.\nExceptional times require exceptional responses and transforming one of Belfast's best-known entertainment venues into a mass vaccination centre in six weeks is one of them.\nThe achievement is down to the hard work and organisational skills of ordinary people.\nSome people have likened fighting coronavirus to a war - once again we have seen a massive rallying of the troops in order to set up the vaccination of potentially thousands of people every day.\nAs the statistics demonstrate, vaccines are slowly breaking the chain from positive case to hospitalisation to severe disease and death.\nAnd the opening of the SSE Arena offers a massive opportunity to step up the vaccination programme even further.\nIt also marks a significant step for the health service, allowing hospitals and GPs' surgeries to get back to what they should be doing.\nAt the same time, the Stormont executive has a challenge of Herculean proportions to keep the public on board - without a doubt there is significant feeling of emotional fatigue as a result of the pandemic.\nSome good news on the horizon about the easing of some restrictions might just be the ticket.\nThe public transport options for travel to the SSE Arena include:\nAs of Monday, 730,471 people in Northern Ireland had received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\nSome 125,017 people had received their second dose, meaning a total of 855,488 jabs have been administered in Northern Ireland."

Vaccines provide a safe way to develop antibodies without risking getting ill. \nThe tests used in the ONS study give a yes/no result based on whether the amount of antibodies in your blood cross a certain threshold.\nBut people can be protected by lower levels of antibodies. \nAnd there are other element of your immune system like T-cells which are not being measured here. \nThere is some evidence to suggest protective T-cells might be detectable for longer than antibodies.\nIt's possible some of the decline is from infections in the first wave, as we know antibodies from infection drop off over time. \nThe study is conducted by taking blood from a representative sample of people around the UK to estimate what proportion of the whole population has antibodies. \nBy 14 March, an estimated 55% of people in England had antibodies, 51% in Wales, 49% in Northern Ireland and 43% in Scotland. \nBut among the over-65s, who are most likely to have been vaccinated, roughly 90% had antibodies. \nThe figures mark a rapid rise in people in the population having protection against Covid - up from roughly a third of people testing positive when levels were measured at the start of March.\nOther data published today shows the number of deaths seen across the UK has remained below what is expected at this time of year, having dipped under average last week. \nThere were 11,666 deaths registered in the week ending 19 March - 8% below the five-year average for this week."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "All eyes are on Minnesota this week as the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin gets underway.\nMr Chauvin faces two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May in Minneapolis.\nProtesters crowded the streets in Mr Floyd's name in cities across the US and around the world over the summer.\nAn African-American political hopeful, a Minnesota resident and a retired police veteran shared their thoughts on Day One of the trial.\nA community activist, an entrepreneur and a father of two, Curtis went viral last year for his impassioned message about the generational injustices African Americans have suffered. He is now running for city council in his hometown of Charlotte.\nTell me how you're feeling as you watch this trial.\nHaving to watch the details of what happened, having to watch the video over, having to relive the moment - it was hurtful. I'm still in awe and I can't believe it happened. \nIt pisses me off. We have some of the most horrific mass murderers of our time in custody without a scratch, but this black man who allegedly uses counterfeit $20 bill loses his life and loses it tragically. \nThey've got to convict the [former police officer]. If they don't convict him, it's going to be a problem.\nWhat did you make of the opening arguments from the two legal teams?\nThe prosecution presented very good evidence. He was very detailed and said some things that I think will be really critical to the case. He reminded us of an officer's oath and said, despite all his training, this officer sat on someone's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds.\nAs for the defence, they're trying to make it seem like George Floyd was a drug addict and the opioids took his life. \nWe already know they [the county medical examiner's officer] deemed this a homicide. And we know that police officers are supposed to care for who is in their custody and they did not do that. They had no regard for George Floyd's life. Did he need to lose his life? \nThe officer came to a situation where he should have de-escalated and given out a ticket in the worst case scenario.\nWhat impact do you think this trial will have?\nI'm watching the case closely because I want to see what the outcome is going to be. Are we going to hold this officer accountable for his actions? \nThis is a chance for America to show exactly what they represent: giving everybody liberty and justice for all. \nIf you don't convict him of all three charges, you're simply telling black America and minority Americans that we do not care for you. This is a white America and you're going to get down or lay down. Now people are fighting for equality, but soon they'll be fighting for revenge. \nMelissa is a mixed-race resident of the Minneapolis-St Paul area and a mother of two. With the trial unfolding 'in her backyard', she is keeping a close eye on it and hopes to see some accountability\nTell me how you're feeling as you watch this trial. \nThis trial is in our backyard, so I'm cautiously optimistic there will be some justice here. \nThere was rioting in St Paul [last year]. Buildings burned down. Businesses we frequented were permanently closed down. Our neighbourhood Trader Joe's [grocery store] was raided. That was all very concerning, but my current concern is a fair trial.\nI think there needs to be some level of accountability for Chauvin. I have a lot of respect for the police but I do think some officers - although rare - take advantage of their authority and go too far. \nWhat did you make of the opening statements from the two legal teams?\nThe defence is trying to make the case that the officer was just following his training. They are also saying there's no evidence of asphyxiation and that the actual cause of death was related to heart issues and drugs in his system. \nHe had pre-existing conditions that he lived with just fine until he was down on the ground with people on his back and neck for nine minutes, so I'm not sure it was those pre-existing conditions - and not the actions of the officers - that took his life. \nWhat impact do you think this trial will have?\nThe United States as a country is much more aware of racial injustice and inequality for people of colour. We're much more \"woke\" than last year. That's been a big change and I think it's a permanent change in our culture. \nI'm a bit concerned because we've been here before and I don't think things have gotten better in terms of the treatment of African Americans in the judicial system. I don't understand the nuances of the three different charges, but I hope Chauvin is found guilty of something because he needs to be held accountable for what he did.\nA retired police lieutenant who spent 34 years on the force in two states, Randy trained law enforcement for over three decades and founded The Wounded Blue, a national organisation that assists injured and disabled officers.\nTell me how you're feeling as you watch this trial\nIf this was a normal trial - that is, there wasn't so much politics and emotion involved - I'd much rather be sitting at the defence's table than the prosecutor's table. The fact they charged Chauvin with three charges indicates that they are not confident in a conviction. They're throwing it against the wall and hoping that one will succeed in a conviction. \nThe issue is that there are so many sociological factors at play here and, whether or not you can get an entire jury to agree on a conviction is going to be a very large burden for the prosecution.\nThis is a watershed moment for law enforcement because of the actions that took place as a result of the death of George Floyd. We've already seen how this has affected law enforcement in so many ways, from the political environment to the violence towards police. \nThis is a highly charged and emotional case, so that is a huge hurdle for the defence. No use of force looks good. It is always ugly and controversial, but that doesn't mean it's not reasonable.\nWhat did you make of the opening arguments from the two legal teams?\nI found the opening arguments very interesting. The prosecution has signalled their strategy very clearly and that is to work on the emotions of the jurors. They did that by the initial playing of the video. Now the prosecution has the heavy burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there was intent involved with his death. \nThe defence was prepared, coherent and easily understandable. There was no flashiness or flamboyance. It was meat and potatoes defence work. This was about explaining to laypeople the very complicated issue of the reasonableness of Chauvin's actions because that is going to be the linchpin of this case. \nWhat took place on that day could have happened to any police officer in the country. \nThis all comes down to whether the actions of Chauvin were reasonable.\nWhat impact do you think this trial will have?\nThis has already affected law enforcement in ways that will ripple through for decades. The entire parameters of use of force are being re-examined. The pullback of resources. The defunding aspects. The training aspects. \nThere is a crisis in law enforcement and it is barrelling towards us like a freight train. And that is de-policing, a lack of qualified applicants willing to enter the profession and the lack of retention of officers. You're seeing them quit and retire, and there's a huge learning curve in the confidence levels of law enforcement. "

It's up to them to make sure best standards are upheld.\"\nBut Mr Kwarteng said he could not \"act as judge and jury in this case\", as he was not \"fully cognisant\" of what had happened.\n\"I don't know what the actual facts are,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"There are lots of allegations.\"\nThe Committee on Standards In Public Life has said it does not investigate individual cases, but it is looking more widely at issues of lobbying and transparency.\nIt was recently reported that Mr Cameron had unsuccessfully lobbied Chancellor Rishi Sunak on behalf of Greensill Capital to increase the firm's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to companies struggling in the pandemic.\nMr Kwarteng said: \"He was an employee of the company and there was nothing wrong with that... There is nothing particularly exceptional about that.\"\nAnd he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"no suggestion\" the former prime minister \"could not pursue another career after politics\".\nHe added that the government was \"always reviewing the rules\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"obvious gaps\" in the regulations had been \"exposed\", adding: \"What's happening with Greensill gets murkier by the day, and I think it's obvious that there's got to be an inquiry. There are too many unanswered questions.\"\nAnd Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, called for a \"tightening of the rules\" on lobbying, adding that current Prime Minister Boris Johnson was \"rather casual on this standards issue at the moment\".\nA spokesperson for the government said it had \"significantly increased transparency on the workings of government\" since 2010.\n\"The government will be going further to review and improve business appointment rules, and increase transparency in procurement, to ensure we maintain the highest standards in public life,\" they added. \nGreensill Capital - the main backer of the firm Liberty Steel, which employs 5,000 people in the UK - went bust recently.\nThe government says it is looking at \"all options\" for keeping Liberty Steel going and saving jobs.\nMr Cameron was cleared last week by a lobbying watchdog, which looked at whether he should have declared himself on the register of consultant lobbyists over work he had done for the firm since leaving Downing Street.\nA government spokesman said Mr Greensill had previously acted as a supply-chain finance adviser and Crown representative - adding the appointment had been unpaid and approved in the normal manner."

      "tags": "Schools,Sexual harassment,Highgate",
      "text": "Students at private schools have said allegations of sexual abuse by fellow pupils have been ignored because staff wish to protect the reputation of the school - and the income associated with its prestige.\nOne girl, who says she was raped by a boy at school, said her teachers handed her allegation to the police before \"washing their hands of it to protect their image\".\nThe debate about how our schools are run has escalated recently after a website was set up for victims to post anonymous accounts of abuse they had suffered. There are even calls for a public inquiry.\nThe number of allegations made by pupils on the Everyone's Invited website now number in their thousands, with children as young as nine posting testimonies claiming assault, harassment and rape.\nMany of the claims are made by young women about the young men who are at school or college or university with them, or part of the same social groups.\nSpeaking anonymously, an 18-year-old girl told the BBC she was raped by a boy who was \"one of the brightest students\" at her school, the name of which she did not disclose. \n\"So therefore it was his needs above mine, they didn't want him to be removed,\" she said. \"They didn't want him to have his prefect badge taken away because it would affect his future. \n\"And they want to be able to say, oh, yeah, we taught this child and they were so bright, so they didn't do anything. He didn't get any sanctions. They just didn't want to get in his way.\n\"I've been on anti-depressants for a year and almost went on anti-anxiety tablets to help with my sleeping because obviously that's been affected\". \nThe girl's mother believes \"there was a fear of what other people, families, parents might think.\n\"And if you think about a private school, they need people to be coming to pay their bills. They need the next intake,\" she said.\n\"And if they are embroiled in a scandal, that's going to have an impact on them\". \nHighgate School in north London is among the private schools caught up in the claims.\nA former student of the school says when she took her claims to staff, she was ignored: \"A friend raped me at a party in Year 13 [upper sixth]. \n\"I reported the rape to the school eight days afterwards - and so began their massive failure to support me.\n\"In a meeting with my parents, a senior member of staff said 'alcohol was involved', suggesting that this made my situation less legitimate. \n\"I was told that it was merely my word against his.\"\nBBC Newsnight has seen a several-page dossier containing hundreds of testimonies saying similar things. \nThe school said it is launching an \"immediate external review of the sexual abuse and harassment allegations\" and is \"working on an anti-sexism plan\". \nPrivate schools partly rely on private financing through their fees - some of those listed on the Everyone's Invited website charge more than \u00a320,000 a year. \nStudents from these schools often go to the best universities, so the fees are seen as a good investment and a guarantee of a good education.\nBut there are calls for less focus on academia and more focus on behaviour and attitudes.\nSir Anthony Seldon, the former head of the independent Wellington College, called the emerging scandal \"a horror\".\n\"We need to have a revitalised education system that really does the best for every child... instead of just giving them all the educational advantages but also the development of their holistic character, their creativity, their ability to be able to perform well in work and in society, knowing how to manage their mental health. \n\"I mean, goodness, school is about so much more than just tests and exams\".\nThe Department for Education has reiterated it is working with the police to provide support and protection to those reporting abuse.  \nThe alleged victims are hoping that shining a very public light onto their claims can lead to change - but some fear when that spotlight is switched off, these changing attitudes could fade."

      "tags": "Computer hacking,Cyber-security",
      "text": "Cyber-security companies are warning about the rise of so-called 'extortionware' where hackers embarrass victims into paying a ransom.\nExperts say the trend towards ransoming sensitive private information could affect companies not just operationally but through reputation damage.\nIt comes as hackers bragged after discovering an IT Director's secret porn collection.\nThe targeted US firm has not publicly acknowledged that it was hacked.\nIn its darknet blog post about the hack last month, the cyber-criminal gang named the IT director whose work computer allegedly contained the files.\nIt also posted a screen grab of the computer's file library which included more than a dozen folders catalogued under the names of porn stars and porn websites.\nThe infamous hacker group wrote: \"Thanks God for [named IT Director]. While he was [masturbating] we downloaded several hundred gigabytes of private information about his company's customers. God bless his hairy palms, Amen!\"\nThe blog post has been deleted in the last couple of weeks, which experts say usually implies that the extortion attempt worked and the hackers have been paid to restore data, and not publish any more details.\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe same hacker group is also currently trying to pressure another US utility company into paying a ransom, by posting an employee's username and password for a members-only porn website.\nAnother ransomware group which also has a darknet website shows the use of similar tactics.\nThe relatively new gang has published private emails and pictures, and is calling directly for the mayor of a hacked municipality in the US to negotiate its ransom.\nIn another case, hackers claim to have found an email trail showing evidence of insurance fraud at a Canadian agriculture company.\nBrett Callow, a threat analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, says the trend points to an evolution of ransomware hacking.\n\"This is the new norm. Hackers are now actually searching the data for information that can be weaponised. If they find anything that is incriminating or embarrassing, they'll use it to leverage a larger pay-out. These incidents are no longer simply cyber-attacks about data, they are full-out extortion attempts.\"\nAnother example of this was seen in December 2020, when the cosmetic surgery chain The Hospital Group was held to ransom with the threat of publication of 'before and after' images of patients.\nRansomware has evolved considerably since it first appeared decades ago.\nCriminals used to operate alone, or in small teams, targeting individual internet users at random by booby-trapping websites and emails.\nIn the last few years, they've become more sophisticated, organised and ambitious.\nCriminal gangs are estimated to be making tens of millions of dollars a year, by spending time and resources targeting and attacking large companies or public bodies for huge pay-outs, sometimes totalling millions of dollars.\nBrett Callow has been following ransomware tactics for years, and says he saw another shift in methods in late 2019.\n\"It used to be the case that the data was just encrypted to disrupt a company, but then we started seeing it downloaded by the hackers themselves.\n\"It meant they could charge victims even more because the threat of selling the data on to others was strong.\"\nThis latest trend of threatening to publicly damage an organisation or individual has particularly concerned experts because it is hard to defend against.\nKeeping good backups of company data helps businesses to recover from crippling ransomware attacks, but that is not enough when the hackers use extortionware tactics.\nCyber-security consultant Lisa Ventura said: \"Employees should not be storing anything that could harm a firm reputationally on company servers. Training around this should be provided by organisations to all their staff.\n\"It's a troubling shift in angle for the hackers because ransomware attacks are not only getting more frequent, they are also getting more sophisticated.\n\"By identifying factors such as reputational damage, it offers far more leverage to extort money from victims.\"\nA lack of victim reporting and a culture of cover-up makes estimating the overall financial cost of ransomware difficult.\nExperts at Emsisoft estimate that ransomware incidents in 2020 cost as much as $170bn (\u00a3123bn) in ransom payments, downtime and disruption."

      "tags": "China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "China has passed sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral rules which will tighten its control over the city.\nThe number of directly elected seats in parliament has been cut almost by half, and prospective MPs will first be vetted by a pro-Beijing committee to ensure their loyalty to the mainland. \nThe aim is to ensure only \"patriotic\" figures can run for positions of power. \nCritics warn it will mean the end of democracy, fearing it will remove all opposition from the city parliament.\nBut Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, said there is not a \"one-size-fits-all\" way of doing democracy, adding the vetting committee will not screen people out based on their political views, but rather weed out any \"non-patriots\".\nMrs Lam said as long as the candidates can show allegiance to Hong Kong, uphold the Basic Law and pass national security checks, they will be permitted to run for election.\n\"For people who hold different political beliefs, who are more inclined towards more democracy, or who are more conservative, who belong to the left or belong to the right, as long as they meet this very fundamental and basic requirement, I don't see why they could not run for election,\" she said on Tuesday.\nThe first vote under the changes, which will elect members to Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), will be held in December.\nBeijing's rubber-stamp parliament first approved the plan during the National People's Congress (NPC) meetings earlier in March. \nOn Tuesday, Chinese state media reported that the country's top decision-making body, the NPC Standing Committee, voted unanimously to pass it. This amends the annexes of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law. \nOpposition figures say the changes are designed to keep anyone who is not aligned with Beijing's rule out of parliament.\n\"This whole new system is really degrading and very oppressive,\" Emily Lau, a pro-democracy former lawmaker told AFP, adding that she thought political unrest could explode on Hong Kong's streets again.\n\"If you have so many people who are very unhappy inside, all you need is a little trigger and that would spark a lot of people.\"\n\"Giving a police force the power to oversee who can stand for elections is not seen in systems usually deemed democratic in a meaningful sense,\" said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of politics at the National University of Singapore.\nBy Jeff Li, BBC Chinese, Hong Kong\nHong Kong has seen this change coming for some time. \nEver since China's top legislature decided in the middle of March to reform the city's electoral system, rumours have been going around about what the reforms will look like. \nAnd the pro-democracy camp finds none of them to its liking. \nAs the reforms became reality, pro-Beijing supporters celebrated. But the mood is very different on the other side, as the pro-democrats face an uncertain political future despite their popular support among voters.  \nChief Executive Carrie Lam says Beijing is not ruling out pro-democracy candidates, and that some of them \"are also patriots\".  \nBut the head of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party wasn't so sure. When asked whether his party would consider running under the reformed electoral process, Lo Kin-hei stopped short of giving a direct answer - and only called on the city's residents to \"strive on and keep faith\".\nState news outlet Xinhua has reported a list of reforms which, among other things, impact the way Hong Kong's parliamentary Legislative Council is formed, effectively making it easier to bar politicians deemed critical of Beijing.\nThe number of directly elected LegCo members falls from 35 to 20, while LegCo's size is increased from 70 to 90 seats - thus diluting the influence of democratically elected politicians.\nAll prospective LegCo candidates will now have to go through two rounds of vetting before they can run, by the powerful pro-Beijing Election Committee as well as by a new screening committee. Carrie Lam said that will include background checks by the police and national security department.\nThe changes come months after several opposition lawmakers were disqualified, which led to the entire opposition in LegCo resigning. \nIf a future veto keeps critics out of LegCo, such public embarrassments would be much less likely. \nThe legal amendments will take effect on Wednesday, and Hong Kong will change its local laws to reflect them in coming weeks. Several local elections are coming up in 2021.\nBritain handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the Basic Law was created under the handover agreement under the \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThis essentially gives Hong Kong more freedoms than the mainland, freedoms which are supposed to remain intact until 2047.\nBut in recent years Beijing has gradually stepped up its influence on Hong Kong.\nAfter years of pro-democracy protests, fresh demonstrations in 2019 escalated into waves of violence between activists and police - and major gains for the opposition in local elections. \nIn 2020 Beijing passed a controversial national security law, also adding it to a Basic Law annex, which essentially reduced Hong Kong's judicial autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators.\nSince then, a string of critics have been arrested under the law, which carries life in prison as a maximum sentence.\nCritics, including the UK government, allege that with these moves to assert more control over Hong Kong, China is undermining the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which Beijing denies.\nFor example, there is controversy over whether the \"patriot\" electoral reforms change the Basic Law and therefore violate the handover agreement.\nWhile Hong Kong's pro-Beijing camp says the changes do not have an impact on the mini-constitution, as only its annexes are being amended, the pro-democracy side insists they do.\n\"Technically, it's not a change to the Basic Law,\" Prof Chong told the BBC. \n\"But in terms of [affecting] the spirit of having competitive elections and moving towards universal suffrage, it would be.\""

      "text": "Sir Lenny Henry has written an open letter urging black Britons to take the Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe comedian and actor said people should \"trust the facts\" and guard against misinformation.\nThe letter has been signed by high-profile figures such as actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, YouTube star KSI and actress Thandie Newton.\nVaccination rates among black Britons are considerably lower than among white Britons.\nAccording to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, vaccination rates for people in England identifying as having black African heritage stand at 58.8%, the lowest among all ethnic minority groups, and 68.7% within the black Caribbean community.\nBy contrast, for people identifying as white British, there is an estimated take-up rate of 91.3%.\nThe disparity exists despite a widespread study suggesting black people are twice as likely as white people to catch the coronavirus.\nAsked why there was caution in the black community about having the vaccine, Sir Lenny blamed an \"element of mistrust\" in the system.\nHe said people felt \"certain institutions and authorities haven't particularly done right by the black community in the past\" so asked \"why should they do something for us now? Why are they doing us all a big favour?\"\nSir Lenny's letter, addressed to \"mums, dads, grandparents, uncles, aunties, brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, daughters, sons and cousins\", recognises these historic \"legitimate worries and concerns\".\nBut it adds: \"We're asking you to trust the facts about the vaccine from our own professors, doctors, scientists involved in the vaccine's development, GPs, not just in the UK but across the world, including the Caribbean and Africa.\"\nThe appeal, which is backed by the NHS, has also been turned into a short film directed by Bafta-winning filmmaker Amma Asante.\nAsante told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The most important thing for us was to put across a message that for all the divisions that exist, we deserve to be protected and our loved ones deserve to be protected. We don't want to widen divisions and equalities that exist.\"\nThe film will be aired on Sky, BT Sport, Viacom, Discovery, A&E and ROK and Channel 5 on Tuesday 30 March from 20:00 BST. \nSir Lenny told BBC Breakfast: \"It came together really quickly - within a couple of weeks we were making the film. People were all over the place. We all managed to make this little film with Amma directing us remotely.\"\nHe described the film, which has a personal feel with the focus on family and friends, as \"very moving\".\nOther signatories include author Malorie Blackman, DJ Trevor Nelson, historian David Olusoga and actors Adrian Lester, Naomi Ackie and David Harewood.\n\"The vaccine's been tested for all ethnicities. It's safe, it's our way out of the pandemic,\" Sir Lenny said. \"If you're in any way hesitant, talk to a medical professional\u2026 trust the experts, don't trust your mate down the pub or conspiracies online. This is serious now. Don't be misinformed.\n\"Perhaps after there'll be an opportunity to rebuild our trust in authority and institutions but for now\u2026 take the jab.\"\nThe comedian also spoke about his own experience of getting the jab.\n\"I did find it emotional,\" he said. \"Because of lockdown, I've not been out very often, I talked to this poor doctor there [for ages] - they were like, 'The jab happened 10 minutes ago, can you leave now!'\"\nHe added: \"The staff are so brilliant, they explain things, they want you to feel comfortable, they're really good people. Any trepidation is misinformed. It's over so quickly, it doesn't hurt, it's a cool thing to do.\"\nThe Comic Relief co-founder also used the launch of the letter to address government intervention.\nAsked if the UK government had done enough to build up the trust of the black community, Sir Lenny told the Press Association: \"They waited and that's why we're in this terrible situation, so it's a bit ironic to accuse the black community of hesitating. \n\"There are mitigating circumstances to the trust and the lack of take-up and those things need to be mended before people can move forward, and we're doing our bit to do that and perhaps the government needs to do the same too.\n\"My thing is, we're all in this together. Black, white, Asian, whatever, we're all in it together. We all want our families and our loved ones to survive.\"\nEarlier this year, British Asian celebrities including comedians Romesh Ranganathan, Meera Syal and cricketer Moeen Ali made a video urging people to get the Covid vaccine.\nFake news about the vaccine, particularly in the South Asian community, has led to concerns about uptake.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Open water swimming,Human spaceflight,Astronauts,International Space Station",
      "text": "Spending very long periods of time in space has something in common with extreme endurance swimming: both can cause the heart to shrink.\nThat's the conclusion of a study that compared the effects of astronaut Scott Kelly's year in space with a marathon swim by athlete Beno\u00eet Lecomte.\nBoth remove the loads on the heart that are usually applied by gravity, causing the organ to atrophy.\nExercise wasn't enough in either case to counteract the changes to the heart.\nThe study was led by Dr Benjamin Levine, professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and is published in the journal Circulation.\nThe research has implications for very long-duration journeys in space - such as the expeditions to Mars which Nasa plans to mount in coming decades.\n\"One of the things we've learned over many years of study, is that the heart is remarkably plastic. So the heart adapts to the load that's placed on it,\" Professor Levine, who is also director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, a collaboration between UT Southwestern and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, told BBC News.\n\"In spaceflight, one of the things that happens, is you no longer have to pump blood uphill, because you're not pumping against gravity.\"\nScott Kelly spent 340 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to allow scientists to study the effects of long-duration flights on the human body.\nOn 5 June 2018, Beno\u00eet Lecomte embarked on an effort to swim the Pacific Ocean, having previously traversed the Atlantic.\nHe swam 2,821km over 159 days, eventually abandoning the attempt.\nSwimming for very long periods also changes the loads placed on the heart by gravity because the person is in a horizontal position rather than vertical.\nLecomte swam an average of 5.8 hours per day, sleeping for around eight hours each night. This meant that he was spending between nine and 17 hours each day in a prone state.\nScientists sometimes use bed rest studies to simulate spaceflight because lying down eliminates the head-to-foot gradient that places a load on the heart. But Prof Levine said water immersion for long periods in a horizontal position is an even better model for time spent in orbit.\n\"Now you take away the head-to-foot gradient and then you put the person in the water, so you adjust that gradient too. It's just about like being in space,\" said Prof Levine.\nBecause both men were no longer pumping blood uphill, as Prof Levine puts it, their hearts began to lose mass.\n\"When we look at the left ventricle [of the heart] we see about a 20-25% loss in total mass over the four or five months that Mr Lecomte was swimming,\" said co-author Dr James MacNamara, also from the UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\"We saw specifically 19% and 27% of mass lost for Captain Kelly over the year.\"\nExercise, however, counteracts the process of mass loss. Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) are already subjected to an intense exercise regime to mitigate the muscle and bone wastage that also occurs in orbit.\nEven so, this exercise regime wasn't enough to prevent the heart atrophy seen in Captain Kelly.\nAt the start of the study, researchers had wondered whether the amount of physical exercise Mr Lecomte was doing in the water might be enough to prevent the heart tissue wasting.\n\"I absolutely thought that Ben's heart would not atrophy. That's one of the nice things about science - you learn the most when you find things you didn't expect,\" said Prof Levine.\n\"It turns out when you swim for that many hours a day, it's not like Michael Phelps, he's not swimming as hard as he can.\"\nInstead, Mr Lecomte kicked his legs relatively lightly throughout. \"It's just not that much activity. Low levels of physical activity do not protect the heart from adapting to the absence of gravity,\" said Prof Levine.\nThe heart adaptations, however, aren't long-term - both men's hearts returned to normal once they were back on terra firma.\nBut chambers in the heart known as the atria expand in space, in part because of changes in the way fluid passes through. This might lead to a condition called atrial fibrillation, where the heart beats fast and in an irregular manner. It can impair exercise, but may also increase the risk of stroke.\nThere's also another risk to this vital organ from space travel. The higher radiation levels in space might accelerate coronary heart disease. Astronauts are screened for atherosclerosis, but they are generally middle-aged when they go into space and scientists know this is a problem that builds with age. \nThis is important because suffering a heart attack in space could be catastrophic.\nProf Levine is part of a Nasa programme called Cipher that will send another 10 astronauts into space for long-duration missions. The researchers will subject the crew members' hearts to a number of different tests and high-tech scanning methods for a more detailed picture of heart function in space.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "Wednesday marks the last day that about four million of the most clinically vulnerable people in England and Wales are advised to shield at home.\nLetters have been sent out to the group in the last few weeks. \nThey are still being advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people.\nThe change comes amid falling Covid cases and hospital admissions.\nAccording to NHS Digital, there are 3.8 million shielded patients in England and 130,000 in Wales.\nScotland and Northern Ireland are expected to lift their restrictions later in April.\nPeople identified as being clinically extremely vulnerable were advised to take extra care to avoid contracting Covid-19 because they are considered more at risk of needing hospital treatment.\nThey include people who have had stem cell transplants or are having chemotherapy treatment for cancer, and adults with chronic kidney disease.\nIn February, another 1.7 million people in England were added to the list, based on the clinical judgement of their GP or hospital doctor.\nAnyone shielding has been entitled to priority access to a Covid vaccination before the general population.\nPeople affected by shielding included Rob Smith, from Hull, who has muscular dystrophy.\nShielding for more than a year has been a \"nightmare\", he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"Where I was able to go out, I didn't feel I wanted to. I didn't feel confident to face people again,\" he said.\n\"I've always been sociable.... It's had a massive impact.\"\nMr Smith now says he feels anxious about the future and believes for many people who have been shielding, it will \"take time to get used to being out there again\".\nHe is also wary of the risk of mixing with others again.\n\"I have had the first jab - knowing I'm going to be out there mixing potentially with people who could be carrying the virus - it is still an anxious time,\" he said.\nFor Katherine Taylor in Essex, who has a rare neurological disorder and hyper-mobility, the last year has been a \"real mixture of emotions\".\nHer employer, a local college, has \"been really brilliant and supportive\" and allowed her to do her job as an event planner from home. She will continue to work from home in the next few months.\nBut she said: \"The isolation of not actually being able to see and do the things you'd normally do has been really, really difficult - particularly not being able to see my parents.\"\nIt has also been hard for Mrs Taylor not to attend in-person physiotherapy sessions and to have hospital appointments put off.\nShe said it would be a \"relief to get back to some sort of normal again\" - go shopping with her daughter and eventually take a holiday break with her family in the camper van her husband has been fixing-up over lockdown.\n\"I'm feeling really good now about the future,\" she said, adding she was excited to \"see friends, spend more time with my family, so many things\".\n\"Just such simple things we took for granted.\" \nTuesday's daily coronavirus figures showed deaths and hospital admissions continuing to fall.\nThere were 56 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 289 patients admitted to hospital, with the seven-day averages for each down by 35% and 22.1% respectively. \nA further 4,040 cases were recorded, with the seven-day average down by 7.9%. \nThe figures also showed 30,680,948 people have now received a first dose of the vaccine, while 3,838,010 have had two doses.  \nOn Monday, restrictions in England were eased, allowing groups to meet outdoors. \nOutdoor sport facilities, including swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses, have reopened, while weddings are also on again.\nSpeaking on Monday at a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson it was not clear \"exactly how strong\" the UK's defences would be against another wave of Covid, despite the \"impressive\" vaccine rollout.\nBut he also said he could not \"see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the road map\" of easing further restrictions.\nFrom 12 April, shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality will reopen in England, if strict conditions are met.

If it gets approval by the regulator - expected in the coming weeks - supplies could be available in June.\nRoger Connor, president of GSK vaccines, said: \"GSK is delighted to support Novavax and the UK Vaccines Taskforce with this manufacturing arrangement for the UK and our Barnard Castle facility is now undertaking the rapid preparation work required to manufacture up to 60 million doses of this vaccine.\n\"We have ensured that we can deliver these volumes without impacting supply of our other vital medicines and vaccines, and without disruption to the other Covid-19 collaborations GSK is engaged in globally.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

This was 106 deaths (14.6%) fewer than the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nThis is the largest weekly difference across nations and regions in England and Wales.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 40,075 from all causes, 7,764 mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 6,017 deaths above the five-year average.\nWhen deaths occurring up to 19 March but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,779.\nThe second wave peak occurred on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths."

      "text": "The decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to recommend any prosecutions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey has divided opinion across the political spectrum.\nMr Storey, a senior republican figure, died in June last year when Covid restrictions were in place.\nHis funeral attracted more than 2,000 mourners - including Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill - causing a political furore.\nHere are some of the reactions to the PPS decision not to prosecute.\nSinn F\u00e9in President Mary Lou McDonald said it was good the process had \"reached a conclusion\".\nThe decision not to prosecute \"is the decision arrived at independently by those who are charged to make these decisions,\" she told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9.\n\"I understand at the time of that funeral, that there was alarm and some hurt at the number of people that were out to pay their respects. \n\"Certainly for our part, for my part, I regret that that hurt was felt,\" she added.\nWhile DUP leader Arlene Foster has called on PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to step down over the PPS' decision not to prosecute, some of her party colleagues went further.\nEast Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said he was \"flabbergasted\" by the outcome.\nHe said the outcome had done \"untold damage\" to the police and the PPS.\nStormont's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, whose father died last spring, tweeted that he was \"disgusted\" with the decision.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership must be held accountable.\n\"We should be clear, a decision not to prosecute is not a determination that no law was broken and it is not a verdict on the actions of those who took part,\" said the Foyle MP.\n\"Public rules that were communicated with the weight of law, and respected with that burden by so many families and circles of friendship, were egregiously breached by people who had a full hand in setting those regulations. That demands accountability\".\nThe SDLP is seeking to bring back MLAs early from Easter recess through a recall petition to discuss the decision by the PPS not to prosecute.A recall petition needs the signatures of 30 MLAs to be successful.SDLP sources said they were confident of reaching that figure.However it would be up to the assembly speaker to decide when any recall would happen.\nThe PPS decision was \"regrettable\", said UUP leader Steve Aiken.\n\"That in the height of the Covid pandemic Sinn F\u00e9in saw fit to very publicly and visibly flout the rules and guidelines that applied to everyone else in Northern Ireland should be of concern to us all.\n\"Sinn F\u00e9in have clearly been allowed to get away with something that no other organisation or citizen would have been allowed to do and that has very serious implications.  \n\"Rules and the law must apply equally to everyone, or else they might as well not exist.\n\"That there is now a very distinct perception that there is two-tier policing in Northern Ireland is a matter that must be addressed\".\nAlliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"The onus lies with Sinn F\u00e9in to belatedly take responsibility for their actions,\" he said.\n\"It undermined the entire messaging of the executive and others last year - Michelle O'Neill needs to issue an unreserved, unambiguous public apology on the matter, and now show some leadership.\"\nHowever, Mr Farry said he did not think PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign.\n\"There is obviously a major emotional reaction to what happened and the lack of accountability to what transpired last summer - I think the police are the wrong target in that regard.\n\"I think the focus has to be on Sinn F\u00e9in and holding them to account and demanding that they do far better in terms of recognising the hurt and damage that has been done\".\nTUV leader Jim Allister said the decision not to prosecute was \"wholly perverse\".\n\"Fear of offending, once again, republicans and favour towards the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership who are apparently above the law, the very law that they made,\" he said.\nGreen Party leader Clare Bailey said there had been a failure of political leadership \"at a time when people needed it the most\".\n\"Apologies to date have been reserved and fall short of acknowledging the standards required from those in senior public office,\" she said.\nMs Bailey added: \"People have sacrificed so much as we enter into the second year of the pandemic. This in spite of the lack of leadership from people who knew better but chose to act otherwise.\""

      "text": "A retired judge has widened the scope of an inquest into the death of a woman who came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok to allow scrutiny of the role played by the Russian state. \nDawn Sturgess, 44, died in hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire, in July 2018.\nBaroness Hallett said the inquest would be \"fair, fearless and thorough\".\nMs Sturgess' death followed the attempted poisoning of former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.\nLady Hallett said she would examine:\nHer decision is preliminary and will depend on the disclosure of evidence.   \nMs Sturgess collapsed at her partner Charlie Rowley's home in Amesbury, eight miles from Salisbury, on 30 June 2018 when she came into contact with a perfume bottle containing Novichok.\nThe mother-of-three died in hospital on 8 July. Mr Rowley, who also came into contact with the substance, was seriously ill but recovered.\nThe family of Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley both supported the widening of the investigation.  \nLady Hallett was told at a pre-inquest review earlier that an inquest might not be able to consider top secret information from the security services.\nShe is considering whether to convert it into a full public inquiry, which would be able to hold closed hearings with full access to intelligence documents. \nShe was warned by counsel for the Home Secretary that it could take two years to gather all the evidence available, because of the need to divert security services and military staff from day-to-day work against \"hostile actors\".\nLady Hallett said the family and friends of Ms Sturgess had \"lost not only a loved one but in circumstances that attracted national and international attention\".\nShe said they and all those in the county of Wiltshire \"have my assurance I will conduct a thorough investigation\".\nThe former appeal court judge said she would also \"address public fears and suspicion\" relating to the circumstances of the death.\nMr Skripal and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury four months before Ms Sturgess' death. Both survived the poisoning.\nLady Hallett was appointed to hear the inquest after High Court judges ordered the Wiltshire coroner David Ridley to reconsider its parameters in July.\nMr Ridley initially stated the inquest would not consider the actions of other Russians or the Russian state, nor would it consider where the nerve agent came from.  \nHowever, lawyers for the family successfully argued Mr Ridley was wrong to limit the scope of the inquest.\nIndependent investigator, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, has confirmed the chemical that killed Ms Sturgess was the same type of nerve agent that had been used to poison the Skripals.\nPolice said following the attack there was sufficient evidence to charge the Russians referred to as Mr Petrov and Mr Boshirov with offences including conspiracy to murder.\nThe men denied any involvement and claimed they were only in Salisbury for a sightseeing tour of the cathedral.\nRussia has also repeatedly denied its involvement and President Vladimir Putin asserted the suspects were merely civilians, and not military officers.\nThe poisonings further increased tension between Westminster and the Kremlin.\nAndrew O'Connor QC, counsel to the inquest, said efforts had been made to engage with Mr Petrov and Mr Boshirov in recent years, but their requests had gone unanswered.\nOn that basis he said they should not be considered \"interested parties\" in the inquest, meaning they will not be able to ask questions during the hearing.\nThe coroner agreed and said their previously granted interested-party status would be removed due to their previous lack of co-operation with the investigation.\nThe hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice continues."

      "text": "The first vaccination has been delivered after the SSE Arena in Belfast opened as a mass vaccination centre on Monday.\nUp to 1,850 vaccines are due to be administered at the venue on Monday.\nCentre vaccine manager Tanya Daly said seeing the centre in operation was \"an amazing sight\".\nUp to 40,000 people could be vaccinated each week at the arena, where the AstraZeneca jab will be used.\nPatricia Donnelly, the head of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, told BBC Newsline \"it was like waiting for Christmas\" and was a \"momentous day for everyone concerned\".\n\"We have got a very steady supply of AstraZeneca which is going to be used in this centre (SSE Arena) and also Pfizer which is used in other centres,\" she added.\n\"That steady supply has not let us down at any stage.\"\nMs Donnelly said that at the SSE Arena there was the capacity for 40,000 people to be vaccinated a week, but it would start with 10,000 a week.\n\"We build up over time, as we get more vaccine,\" she said.\nA Covid-19 vaccination scheme at community pharmacies in Northern Ireland was also launched on Monday.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said this would speed up the existing vaccination programme and ease access for people who may struggle to travel to a mass vaccination centre.\nSpeaking from the SSE Arena, where 16 vaccinators are working a 12-hour shift, Ms Daly told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme: \"We are delighted that it is working so well.\n\"It's a fantastic team.\"\nMs Daly said the SSE Arena was not the clinical environment that staff were used to at the Ulster Hospital but that everything had been replicated to the same standards on a larger scale.\nStringent controls and procedures are in place and all staff have received rigorous theoretical and practical training, she said.\n\"We want people to have a good experience, but we want it to be safe,\" she said. \n\"We want to be sure that our vaccinators are not put under pressure; that the right questions are being asked and that everybody gets the vaccine that's appropriate.\"\nHealth officials plan to operate the vaccination service at the SSE Arena up to 14 hours a day, seven days a week.\nFree car parking and shuttle bus services are being offered to people travelling to the arena for their jab.\nGary Davidson, 55, from east Belfast, received the first jab after 08:00 BST.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the opening of the centre was a \"significant milestone\" in the rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme.\nShe said the number of people vaccinated would \"rise significantly in the coming weeks\".\nMaggie Magowan, lead nurse at the South Eastern Trust vaccination centre, said it was a \"monumental day\".\n\"I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get booked in to help protect themselves, their families and our community,\" she said.\nChief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene said pharmacies were \"delighted to be playing their part\" in the vaccination programme and their inclusion showed the \"major progress\" that is being made.\nAbout 343 pharmacies in Northern Ireland are currently taking part.\nIn Northern Ireland, vaccines are available to people aged 50 or over.\nThose who are eligible can book an appointment online, by phone on 0300 200 7813 or they may be contacted by their GP.\nExceptional times require exceptional responses and transforming one of Belfast's best-known entertainment venues into a mass vaccination centre in six weeks is one of them.\nThe achievement is down to the hard work and organisational skills of ordinary people.\nSome people have likened fighting coronavirus to a war - once again we have seen a massive rallying of the troops in order to set up the vaccination of potentially thousands of people every day.\nAs the statistics demonstrate, vaccines are slowly breaking the chain from positive case to hospitalisation to severe disease and death.\nAnd the opening of the SSE Arena offers a massive opportunity to step up the vaccination programme even further.\nIt also marks a significant step for the health service, allowing hospitals and GPs' surgeries to get back to what they should be doing.\nAt the same time, the Stormont executive has a challenge of Herculean proportions to keep the public on board - without a doubt there is significant feeling of emotional fatigue as a result of the pandemic.\nSome good news on the horizon about the easing of some restrictions might just be the ticket.\nThe public transport options for travel to the SSE Arena include:\nAs of Monday, 730,471 people in Northern Ireland had received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\nSome 125,017 people had received their second dose, meaning a total of 855,488 jabs have been administered in Northern Ireland."

      "text": "Labour says it has obtained an old business card that described financier Lex Greensill as a \"senior adviser\" in David Cameron's office.\nThe card includes a Downing Street email address, and what appears to be a direct line landline telephone number.\nThe party said it raised \"further serious questions\" about Mr Greensill's influence under the ex-PM.\nThe government has said Mr Greensill's role was unpaid and \"approved in the normal manner\". \nThe Sunday Times has reported that he was given \"privileged access\" to Whitehall when he worked as an unpaid adviser under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government.\nNeither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron has commented on the matter.\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC News Channel that unpaid advisers offered Whitehall departments \"fantastic expertise and experience, completely free of charge\".\nHe added that, if Mr Greensill had had a government business card showing an official email account, these would have been \"signed off by civil servants at the time\".\nLabour says the business card was handed to a figure in industry in the summer of 2012 by Mr Greensill, after he started the advisory role on business financing. \nThe Sunday Times reported that during his time in the role, he had promoted a government-backed loans scheme to speed up payments to pharmacists.\nThe company he founded, Greensill Capital, later went on to provide funds for the scheme.\nIn 2018 - two years after he had stood down as prime minister - Mr Cameron became an adviser to the firm.\nLabour has called for an urgent inquiry in to the matter and it wants the Committee on Standards In Public Life to look into the extent of the access to government offered to Mr Greensill under the coalition.\nShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: \"The public have a right to know what happened here . We need a full, transparent and thorough investigation\".\nThe committee has said it does not investigate individual cases, but it is looking more widely at issues of lobbying and transparency.\nLabour has also asked the committee to examine Mr Cameron's reported role in lobbying the government on behalf of Greensill Capital after the firm employed him as an adviser.\nThe Financial Times has previously reported that Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to increase the firm's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to Covid-hit companies.\nGreensill was accredited to supply lending under the government's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, before it filed for insolvency earlier this month.\nLast week, Mr Cameron was cleared by a lobbying watchdog, after it concluded his work for the company did not require declaration on the register of consultant lobbyists.\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"Lex Greensill acted as a Supply Chain Finance Adviser from 2012 to 2015 and as a Crown Representative for three years from 2013.\n\"His appointment was approved in the normal manner and he was not paid for either role.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Department for Education,Sexual harassment",
      "text": "Allegations of sexual abuse made by school pupils on a website are \"shocking and abhorrent\", Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.\nNo school should be a place \"where young people feel unsafe\" or where abuse could take place, he added.\nMr Williamson pledged to take \"appropriate action\", and urged victims to tell someone they trusted.\nThe website Everyone's Invited has recorded 8,000 testimonies of sexual abuse from pupils.\nIt was set up last year as a place where victims can post anonymous accounts of abuse they have suffered.\nMany of the accounts describe allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence carried out against young women by young men who are at school or college or university with them, or part of the same social groups.\nIndependent schools such as Highgate School and Dulwich College are among those that have said they will take action following the online allegations, but the site's founder Soma Sara said \"rape culture\" was a problem for all schools.\nMr Williamson said on Twitter: \"No school - whether an independent school or state school - should ever be an environment where young people feel unsafe, let alone somewhere that sexual abuse can take place.\n\"The allegations that I have heard in recent days are shocking and abhorrent.\nHe said any victim of \"these sickening acts\" should raise their concerns with someone they trusted, such as a teacher, family member or the police. \"We will take appropriate action,\" he said.\nThe government has said it is very concerned by the \"significant\" number of allegations.\nMost schools, colleges and universities took safeguarding responsibilities seriously, but it was \"particularly shocking\" to hear these allegations made about places of education \"where everyone should feel secure and be protected\", a government spokesman said.\nThe Department for Education, the Home Office and the National Police Chiefs' Council were in touch with the Everyone's Invited website to provide support, protection and advice, he added.\nPolice and the government have also said a helpline will be set up to allow victims to access support.\nRobert Halfon, who chairs the House of Commons education select committee, said the Everyone's Invited website was \"pretty grim\" reading and he called for an investigation. \n\"Your heart goes out to all the people who have suffered the abuse, the sexual harassment, the threats, the abuse online,\" said Mr Halfon.\n\"I do think there is a Lord of the Flies culture in some of our schools across our country, and what needs to happen is an urgent inquiry to overhaul safeguarding procedures because they are not fit for purpose.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"There's got to be an inquiry and it has got to get going very fast, this is serious.\"\nHe also called for \"cultural change in terms of behaviour in our schools and in our young people, but also in the respect that is shown particularly for women and girls\".\nJess Phillips, Labour's shadow minister for safeguarding, said ministers had failed to act on \"most\" recommendations put forward following a 2016 inquiry into sexual harassment in violence and schools.\n\"We need a better inspection regime, we need to have a proper inquiry, we need the government to actually be collecting the data - they're not actually currently collecting this data anywhere,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\n\"Whilst I don't think that we should be criminalising every single person who makes an inappropriate joke to a woman, I do think it should be part of every single school's disciplinary proceedings,\" she added.\nMs Sara told the BBC that allegations on the site included \"sexual harassment, groping at a Christmas party, image-based abuse, revenge porn, non-consensual sharing of intimate photos - and just general sexism and misogyny\".\n\"These are stories of rape culture - so where behaviour that's not normal is normalised,\" she said.\nAnonymous testimonies listed on the site do not reveal the identity of the pupils or their attackers, but many schools are named.\nHighgate School, among the private schools caught up in the claims, says it is launching an \"immediate external review of the sexual abuse and harassment allegations\" and is \"working on an anti-sexism plan\".\nDulwich College's head teacher Joe Spence said: \"The behaviour described is distressing and entirely unacceptable\" and \"we are meeting with victims to listen to their experiences and their concerns, and we will act on them\".\nThe website initially drew attention to private schools, particularly in London, but Ms Sara, who is now 22, said that was a consequence of her own background - and that the range of testimonies, from state and private schools, showed this was a much wider issue.\nMany of the incidents recounted took place outside school or university premises, however. \nPaul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said school leaders had to \"ask ourselves what more we can all do to prevent sexual harassment and violence\" - but he said \"this is a problem that reaches far beyond the school gates\".\nNorfolk Chief Constable Simon Bailey blamed the \"volume of pornographic material that's being consumed\".\n\"There's an erosion of an understanding of what normal sexual relationships look like,\" said the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on child protection."

      "text": "British stars will be able to take part in this year's Oscars from a venue in London if they can't get to LA, after organisers said Zoom wasn't an option. \nEight of this year's 20 acting nominees are Brits, including Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan and Riz Ahmed.\nAfter the nominations were announced, those in the running were asked to attend the event in person on 25 April.\nLos Angeles is the main location, but organisers have now added the London hub after concerns about travel.\nInternational nominees will also be able to appear from other satellite link locations. Show producers are still hoping not to use Zoom, but may relax their stance if anyone can't get to the broadcast locations.\nMost guests will be at LA's main railway hub, Union Station, which will become a venue for the 93rd Academy Awards. Part of the show will also take place at the ceremony's normal home, the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\nDaniel Kaluuya, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Olivia Colman, Vanessa Kirby and Gary Oldman will also carry British hopes for the acting awards.\nOther UK hopefuls include director and writer Emerald Fennell; singer Celeste, who is nominated for best song; and Aardman Animations' A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.\nDetails of the new location in London - where it will be the early hours of 26 April when the ceremony takes place - have not yet been revealed.\nDanish director Thomas Vinterberg, Bulgarian Borat star Maria Bakalova and South Korean actress Youn Yuh-Jung are among this year's other international nominees.\nA letter sent to nominees earlier this month said no alternative arrangements would be made for anyone unable to attend in person \"because of scheduling or continued uneasiness about travelling\" during the pandemic.\n\"We are going to great lengths to provide a safe and enjoyable evening for all of you in person, as well as for all the millions of film fans around the world, and we feel the virtual thing will diminish those efforts,\" show producers Steven Soderbergh, Stacey Sher and Jesse Collins wrote.\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the body which oversees the Oscars, has previously promised an \"intimate\" ceremony carried out under strict Covid-19 precautions.\nProducers have said the event would include on-site safety teams, with testing capability.\nThis year's logistical headaches come at the same time as growing questions over the appeal of award ceremonies in modern-day culture, with TV viewing figures falling to an all-time low for last year's Oscars ceremony.\nThe pandemic has also shifted their relevance for some. On Monday, best supporting actor nominee LaKeith Stanfield reportedly responded to the speculation about the ceremony by writing in a now deleted Instagram post: \"No one cares lmao. Real stuff is happening. Who cares about awards.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Companies,Clothing industry,Copyright,Lil Nas X,Retailing,United States,Fashion,Nike, Inc.",
      "text": "Nike is suing Brooklyn art collective MSCHF over a controversial pair of \"Satan Shoes\" that contain a drop of real human blood in the soles.\nThe $1,018 (\u00a3740) trainers, which feature an inverted cross, a pentagram and the words \"Luke 10:18\", were made using modified Nike Air Max 97s.\nMSCHF released 666 pairs of the shoes on Monday in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X and says they sold out in less than a minute.\nNike claims trademark infringement.\nIt has asked the court to stop MSCHF from selling the shoes and prevent them from using its famous Swoosh design mark.\n\"MSCHF and its unauthorised Satan Shoes are likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association between MSCHF's products and Nike,\" the sports shoe giant says in the lawsuit.\nMSCHF \"dropped\" the black and red shoes on Monday, coinciding with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which debuted on YouTube last Friday.\nThe song sees the rapper, who came out in 2019, celebrating his sexuality while rejecting society's attempts to shame him. \nIn the heavily stylised video, he slides down a stripper pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snapping his neck and stealing his horns.\nThe imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - \"So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'.\"\nEach shoe also features a signature Nike air bubble cushioning sole, containing 60 cubic centimetres (2.03 fluid ounces) of red ink and a single drop of human blood, donated by members of the MSCHF art collective. \nIn its filing with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Nike said it did not approve or authorise the customised Satan Shoes.\n\"There is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF's Satan Shoes, based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorised or approved this product,\" it said.\nThe lawsuit cites a tweet by popular shoe influencer @Saint from last Friday, which teased the upcoming release of the shoes and drummed up publicity over the weekend on social media and in the media in the US.\nSome conservatives, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and some religious followers, took offence at the controversial design of the shoes and criticised Lil Nas X and MSCHF on Twitter. \nLil Nas X hit back at the governor and other critics on Twitter, and on Monday was tweeting several memes on his profile in response to news of the Nike lawsuit.\nJoseph Rasch of Tennessee, who paid $1,080 for the trainers, says he is worried the conflict means his money will be lost.\n\"I'm hoping I'll receive them since I paid for them,\" he told BBC OS on World Service radio, adding that he made the purchase not because he definitely planned to wear them but as a political statement.\n\"I wanted to support a black gay man who is attempting to show a different narrative in a majority Christian country that currently is dealing with a lot of issues with black people. So what better way to do that than to buy shoes that this person has collaborated with?\" he said.\nBuyer McKenzi Norris of South Carolina, a longtime follower of the MSCHF art collective, said Nike's lawsuit had disrupted his plans to resell the trainers for $2,500 on eBay, which removed his listing.\n\"In general I think Nike's lawsuit and their intervention is pretty ridiculous considering how much damage it can cause to everyday people like me who just like to customise and resell their products legally,\" he said."

      "tags": "Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "\"Missing: Please Help Our dear friend Sarah Everard,\" read the posters that went up on south London streets and local social media forums in the days after the 33-year-old disappeared on her walk home in early March.\nIt was concerning but such appeals are not exactly a rare sight, and the hope was that she would soon turn up safe and sound. \nBut in the days that followed, as police put out a CCTV image of Sarah and gave details of her last known movements, concern grew to alarm, then dread, then fear, shock and sadness.\nSarah Everard's journey from Clapham Common to Brixton had taken her through some of the capital's most populated, brightly-lit, and well-walked parts. Hundreds of people - many of them young women - tread those pavements every day and consider the streets in and around them home.\nAs the police investigation ramped up, local women were warned to be careful about venturing out alone. When a police officer was arrested - and subsequently charged with Sarah's murder - the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick acknowledged that women in London and beyond \"will be worried and may well be feeling scared\", although she said for a woman to be abducted off the street was an \"incredibly rare\" event.\nBut the case had touched a nerve, particularly as walking is one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown.\nWomen across the country took to social media to discuss their own experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they went to to feel safe. Out poured stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed to. \nHelena Wadia was one of those. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she wanted to highlight how common it was for women to feel unsafe.\n\"The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old,\" she said. \n\"I have been self-policing since then. We moderate everything - our clothing, our drinking. We get taxis where maybe we can't afford it. We hold keys between our fingers. We don't wear headphones when we're jogging. We stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting.\"\nOne tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces was liked more than 120,000 times.\nPeople even began sharing tips on what apps were out there to help women stay safe.\nAnna Birley is one of many people in recent days to have underlined that the narrative around women's safety must change.\n\"What's so upsetting is it shouldn't be our problem,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's not our fault. Women aren't the reason women get attacked.\"\nA vigil she helped plan at Clapham Common - one of several around the country - as a way of \"reclaiming our public spaces and coming together to feel a level of solidarity\" in itself became controversial when it resulted in clashes with police and women were seen being physically restrained.\nSeveral hundred people had turned up despite being told it had to be cancelled because it breached lockdown restrictions. The organisers had criticised the police for failing to \"constructively engage\" with them on efforts to make the event Covid-safe, instead of urging mourners to hold candle-lit vigils at home. \nThe Metropolitan Police defended their actions at the Clapham vigil. They said they \"were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people's safety\", but have faced intense criticism from across the political spectrum.\nOn International Women's Day every year, British MP Jess Phillips reads out the names of all the women and girls killed over the previous 12 months, where a man has been convicted or charged as the main perpetrator.\nThis year it fell on the day remains were found in the hunt for Sarah Everard, and she read out 118 names. \"Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,\" Ms Phillips told Parliament. \"Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common.\"\nIn a separate debate in the Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, Baroness Jenny Jones of Moulescoomb called for an 18:00 curfew for men on the streets.\nShe later told Sky News that while she hadn't been \"entirely serious\", she wanted to make the point that \"when the police victim-blame by asking women to stay home, we don't react. We just think it's normal.\"\nSo what has been the response of men?\nAs women took to social media to tell their stories, Stuart Edwards, who lives five minutes away from where Sarah went missing, tweeted: \"Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor?\" The tweet received 27,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets.\nAmong those who joined the conversation was food critic Jay Rayner, who also lives in south London. \"If I find myself walking behind a single woman on a quiet street I always cross the road to the other side and ideally accelerate away as quickly as possible. I am a big man and absolutely aware what my silhouette looks like in the darkness,\" he tweeted.\nSome however have been keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen.\nBut the issue of violence against women is not one for the UK alone.\nThe World Health Organization this week published a report saying one in three women globally, around 736 million, had been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes.\nWHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said violence against women was \"endemic in every country and culture\", and had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Unlike Covid-19, violence against women cannot be stopped with a vaccine,\" he said, as the WHO called for more investment in services to help vulnerable women."

      "tags": "Minnesota,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.\nGeorge Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFootage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.\nMr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.\nTranscripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers. \nThe key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far. \nIt began with a report of a fake $20 (\u00a316.20) bill.\nA report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.\nBelieving the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police. \nMr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic. \nMr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC. \nBut Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.\nIn a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but \"he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that\", according to a transcript released by authorities.\nThe employee said the man appeared \"drunk\" and \"not in control of himself\", the transcript says.  \nShortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.\nAfter approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.\nMr Lane, prosecutors said, \"put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car\". Then Mr Floyd \"actively resisted being handcuffed\".\nOnce handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for \"passing counterfeit currency\". \nCourt transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car.\nMr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle.\nIt was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued. \nAt about 20:14, Mr Floyd \"stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic\", according to the report. \nMr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.\nDuring this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said. \nHe lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.\nThat's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.\nMr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.\nFor more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time.  \nThe transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\nAt one point, Mr Floyd gasps: \"You're going to kill me, man.\"\nOfficer Chauvin replies: \"Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\"\nMr Floyd says: \"Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\"\nA female bystander told the police: \"His nose is bleeding, come on now.\"\nAbout six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.\nOfficer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but \"couldn't find one\". Yet the other officers did not move. \nAt 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance. \nHe was pronounced dead about an hour later.\nOn the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.\nForgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.\n\"The way he died was senseless,\" Harris said. \"He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\""

      "text": "Roughly half of people in the UK now have antibodies against Covid, either through infection or vaccination, tests conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. \nMost of this will be through vaccination - with 30 million people having received at least one dose.\nAntibodies are proteins in the blood which recognise specific infections and fight them off.\nAmong the oldest who are most at risk, levels are even higher.\nBut there has been a small decline in detectable antibodies in that group since the peak of infections in January.\nThe ONS speculates this might be people who received the vaccine earliest having had their first dose but not their second - but they stress this is not evidence that these people have less immunity.\nOnce someone has had an infection, antibodies help your body to be ready if it encounters it again. Vaccines provide a safe way to develop antibodies without risking getting ill. \nThe tests used in the ONS study give a yes/no result based on whether the amount of antibodies in your blood cross a certain threshold.\nBut people can be protected by lower levels of antibodies. \nAnd there are other element of your immune system like T-cells which are not being measured here. \nThere is some evidence to suggest protective T-cells might be detectable for longer than antibodies.\nIt's possible some of the decline is from infections in the first wave, as we know antibodies from infection drop off over time. \nThe study is conducted by taking blood from a representative sample of people around the UK to estimate what proportion of the whole population has antibodies. \nBy 14 March, an estimated 55% of people in England had antibodies, 51% in Wales, 49% in Northern Ireland and 43% in Scotland. \nBut among the over-65s, who are most likely to have been vaccinated, roughly 90% had antibodies. \nThe figures mark a rapid rise in people in the population having protection against Covid - up from roughly a third of people testing positive when levels were measured at the start of March.\nOther data published today shows the number of deaths seen across the UK has remained below what is expected at this time of year, having dipped under average last week. \nThere were 11,666 deaths registered in the week ending 19 March - 8% below the five-year average for this week."

As the UK's independent regulator has said, when people are called forward, they should get the jab. \n\"Over 30 million people have already received their first dose of a vaccine, and we are on track to offer jabs to all over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July.\"\nAstraZeneca's product is one of the most widely used coronavirus vaccines in the West, and is meant to be supplied on a not-for-profit basis to the developing world.\nThe EU's rollout of its vaccination programme has been dogged by delays because of delivery and production problems, and Germany is among several states now fearing a third wave of infections.\nOn Tuesday, Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi and his wife, who are both 73, received their first doses of AstraZeneca in a display of confidence in the vaccine.\nIf you give a vaccine to millions of people you will of course see some cases of people falling seriously ill or even dying shortly afterwards. It does not mean the vaccine has caused the problem - it could have occurred naturally. What authorities have to work out is whether it is cause or coincidence.\nThey do this by monitoring adverse events after vaccination and see if they are above what you would normally expect. The type of blood clot that has been seen is very rare and so it is hard to know exactly how many cases you would normally expect to see. We do know it is more common in women and taking the pill increases the risk of it happening. \nThere is no evidence yet to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine increases the chances of these clots. But, even if it does, the next thing you have to take into account is whether Covid presents more of a danger. \nRegulators in Europe and the UK are clear - given the current evidence - that use of the vaccine should continue in all ages.\nHealth Minister Jens Spahn and the 16 state health ministers decided to suspend routine use for the under-60s at an emergency meeting on Tuesday.\nPeople under 60 can still receive the jab but only \"at the discretion of doctors, and after individual risk analysis and thorough explanation\", according to a document seen by dpa news agency.\nThe decision was reached on the advice of the German vaccine committee (Stiko) which said: \"After several consultations, Stiko, with the help of external experts, decided by a majority to recommend the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine only for persons aged 60 years and older on the basis of available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects.\"\nAdditional advice about booster shots would be issued by the end of April for younger persons who had already received a first dose of AstraZeneca, Stiko said.\nChancellor Angela Merkel said there must be no doubts about the safety of any drug being administered in Germany: \"We have to be able to trust the vaccines... This also includes the subsequent ongoing testing of their effectiveness and safety, and the permanent weighing of risks and benefits. Confidence arises from the knowledge that every suspicion is counted in every individual case.\"\nThe 66-year-old added that she was open to being vaccinated with AstraZeneca when her turn came.\nAhead of  announcement, the German cities of Berlin and Munich, and the region of Brandenburg, halted use of the vaccine for people below the age of 60.\nGermany was one of the European states which briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab earlier this month pending an EMA review into the possible link to blood clots. \nWhen the EMA declared the vaccine \"safe and effective\", Germany and others resumed its use but investigations continued.\nThe German medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, has found 31 cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) among people who received AstraZeneca in Germany.\nAlmost all the cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women.\nFrance already limits use of AstraZeneca to those aged over 55.\nOn Monday, Canada recommended immediately suspending the use of AstraZeneca in people aged below 55 following the reports of rare but potentially fatal blood clots in Europe, CBC reports.\nThere have been no reports of blood clots related to the jab in Canada itself, where 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca jabs have now been administered.\nIn the UK, five cases of CSVT - one of them fatal - have been recorded among 11 million people who received the vaccine.\nIn another development, Austria confirmed it was in talks with Russia to buy a million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine, which has yet to be approved by the EMA.\nChancellor Sebastian Kurz is under pressure from opposition parties for his government's failure to buy its full share of vaccines under the EU's collective purchasing scheme.\n\"There must be no geopolitical blinkers regarding vaccines,\" Mr Kurz said in a statement issued by his office. \"The only thing that must count is whether the vaccine is effective and safe.\"\nDespite the lack of EMA approval, Sputnik is already being used by fellow EU state Hungary.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed possible co-operation on vaccines with Mrs Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron when they held a video conference on Tuesday, Mr Macron's office said in a statement.

      "tags": "Egypt,Shipping industry,Suez canal,Freight transport",
      "text": "Ships have started sailing through Egypt's Suez Canal again, a day after a giant container vessel blocking the vital trade route was freed. \nThirty-seven ships that were struck at the midway point cleared the waterway overnight, while 70 others are due to travel its entire length on Tuesday.\nThe canal authorities hope to clear the traffic jam of some 300 vessels waiting to use it within three-and-a-half days.\nMeanwhile, the freed ship will be inspected for seaworthiness by experts.\nThe 400m-long (1,312ft), 200,000-tonne Ever Given became wedged diagonally across the canal a week ago after running aground amid high winds.\nIt was refloated on Monday afternoon after a salvage operation involving a flotilla of powerful tug boats and dredging vessels that shifted 30,000 cubic metres (1,059,000 cubic ft) of mud and sand.\nAbout 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.\nAt a news conference on Monday night, the head of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, declared that it would be running at full capacity to clear the backlog as soon as possible.\n\"We won't sleep. This is a new challenge we are working on,\" he said. \"We will work around the clock until we get through the ships. We have faith in this.\"\nCanal services provider Leth Agencies said 306 vessels were waiting as of Tuesday morning - 163 at Suez in the Red Sea, 137 at Port Said in the Mediterranean, and six at the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water that marks the midway point.\nForty-five ships are currently sailing southwards in two convoys, one of which will rendezvous with the six vessels in the lake, while 25 vessels are moving northwards from Suez. The average transit time is between 11 and 12 hours.\nThe ship is anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, where it is undergoing \"an inspection of its seaworthiness\", according to its operator Evergreen Marine.\n\"The outcome of that inspection will determine whether the ship can resume its scheduled service,\" the Taiwanese company said on Monday. \nThe Ever Given's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), said there had been no reports of pollution or cargo damage.\nIt added that initial investigations suggested the vessel ran aground due to strong wind. They also ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause.\nAuthorities have left open the possibility of a technical or human error by the ship's crew or the two Egyptian canal pilots who were on board at the time.\nMr Rabie said the incident was not simply the result of the weather, noting that many ships had passed through the waterway in worse conditions.\n\"The Suez Canal has never been closed because of bad weather,\" he stressed.\nHe also denied size was a factor, saying larger ships had used the waterway. \nThe blockage held up an estimated $9.6bn (\u00a37bn) of goods each day, according to data from Lloyd's List.\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann, an analyst at the shipping journal, told the BBC that the delays would not disappear quickly.\n\"It will take a couple of weeks to clear the backlog. And then, of course, you have the issue, especially with container ships, [of the vessels] all arriving at once at European ports, causing widespread congestion and delays that will trickle all the way down throughout the container shipping sector,\" said. \n\"It will delay empty boxes getting back to China and to Asia to load goods, and then there will be congestion at those ports.\"\nWith cargo vessels reaching their destinations much later than planned, future sailing schedules will also have been thrown into disarray, says BBC business correspondent Theo Leggett.\nExperts say the cost of shipping goods to Europe is likely to rise as a result. \nAll of this comes at a time when delicately balanced supply chains are already struggling to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nFurther disruption simply raises the risk of delays, higher prices or even shortages for businesses and consumers, our correspondent adds."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Jair Bolsonaro,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the heads of the army, navy and air force all quit and the country recorded its highest daily Covid-19 death toll.\nThe unprecedented resignation of the defence chiefs is being seen as a protest at attempts by Mr Bolsonaro to exert undue control over the military.\nMr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to Covid-19.\nNearly 314,000 people have died, with a new daily record of 3,780 on Tuesday.\nWorldwide, Brazil has the second highest number of total confirmed Covid cases with more than 12.6m. Only the United States has more.\nIt is also the country with the second highest number of Covid-related deaths since the pandemic began and its daily deaths currently account for about a quarter of all coronavirus fatalities in the entire world. \nThe high number of cases has brought the health system to the verge of collapse. \nIn 18 of Brazil's 26 states and in the capital, Brasilia, the occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is above 90%, according to Brazilian public health institute Fiocruz. In two states, Amap\u00e1 and Mato Grosso do Sul, ICU are completely full.\nThe latest surge in cases and deaths has been attributed to the spread of a highly contagious variant of the virus which was first detected in Japan in travellers from the city of Manaus, in Brazil's Amazon state. \nPreliminary data suggests the new variant could be up to twice as transmittable as the original version of the virus. \nNeighbouring countries are extremely worried the new variant. Bolivia, which shares a 3,400km-long (2,100 miles) border with Brazil, announced that it would focus its Covid immunisation programme on the border areas.\nBrazil's own vaccine programme has been beset by delays. So far, only 8% of its 211-million-strong population have received a first dose. \nAccording to a poll published by Datafolha in mid-March, 43% of Brazilians blame President Bolsonaro for the poor handling of the pandemic.\nThe far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to \"stop whining\" about the situation.\nWhile his stance made him popular with anti-lockdown protesters, his popularity is falling. In a poll conducted in mid-March, 54% of respondents said his management of the Covid crisis was \"bad\" or \"very bad\", up from 48% in January. \nMr Bolsonaro was a divisive figure even before the pandemic hit and the rapid spread of Covid seems to have further hardened opinions.\nThe Datafolha poll suggests that while the percentage of those who said they \"never trusted\" the president's words rose from 41% to 45% between January and March, those who say they \"always trust\" what has only dropped slightly from 19% to 18% in that same timeframe. \nHowever in recent days, his government has been furthered weakened by a deep political crisis.\nSince the pandemic began, Brazil has had no fewer than four health ministers. The latest is Marcelo Queiroga, a cardiologist, who replaced an army officer with no medical training on 16 March.\nBut while changes in the health ministry have become almost par for the course, this week also saw the foreign minister and five other cabinet ministers leave. \nForeign Minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo had fallen foul of Congress, some of whose members accused him of mishandling relations with China, India and the US, which they said in turn led to Brazil not getting enough Covid vaccines from those countries.  \nBut it was Mr Bolsonaro's sacking of the defence minister, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, which caused the biggest storm so far. \nMr Bolsonaro and his minister had clashed over the issue of the armed forces' loyalty, which the defence minister said should be directed to upholding the constitution rather than supporting the president personally.\nIn a first in Brazilian history, on Tuesday the heads of the army, navy and air force all resigned together in a move signalling their opposition to the president and his sudden sacking of the defence minister's sacking.\nThe role of the armed forces in Brazilian politics has been a contentious issue since the country's return to democracy in 1985 after 21 years of military rule.\nPresident Bolsonaro, a former army captain, caused outrage in 2019 when he organised a commemoration of the 1964 coup which brought the military to power. \nHe also appointed active duty and retired generals to key positions in his cabinet, including the health ministry and the vice-presidency. \nBut in recent weeks, top members of the military seem to have increasingly distanced themselves from the president, culminating in the resignation of the armed forces heads on Tuesday. \nMr Bolsonaro's newly appointed minister of defence, Gen Walter Braga Netto, seems to be more closely aligned with the president. In one of his first statements he said that the 1964 coup had \"pacified the country\" and should be celebrated. \nMarking the coup's anniversary on 31 March, the general said that there had been a \"very real threat to peace and democracy\" and that the armed forces had confronted that threat in 1964."

      "text": "Scotland's political leaders are to face each other in the first TV debate of the Holyrood election campaign.\nThe SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Tory Douglas Ross, Labour's Anas Sarwar, Green Lorna Slater and Lib Dem Willie Rennie will all take part in the BBC programme.\nThey will seek to set out their key policy pledges and arguments ahead of the Scottish Parliament vote on 6 May.\nA further debate is to take place towards the end of the campaign.\nTuesday's programme will be on BBC One Scotland, starting at 19:50. It will run for an hour and 10 minutes and be moderated by the BBC's Scotland Editor Sarah Smith.\nIt can also be viewed on the BBC's News Channel and the iPlayer. It will be streamed live, with added analysis, on the BBC Scotland news website\nNicola Sturgeon - SNP leader - She set out the core principles of the SNP's platform in a campaign conference speech on Monday, saying the poll on 6 May was \"perhaps the most important election in our country's history\". The first minister said she could provide \"strong, experienced leadership that the country needs at this time of crisis\". And she said independence was central to her plans to rebuild Scotland post-pandemic.\nDouglas Ross - Scottish Conservatives leader - He is putting opposition to independence at the heart of their campaign, saying that a new referendum would jeopardise the recovery from Covid-19. Mr Ross has said his party would set out a \"positive plan for Scotland's recovery\" - including the recruitment of more teachers and investment in infrastructure and economic growth - but said none of it could happen if the country was gripped by a fresh constitutional debate.\nAnas Sarwar - Scottish Labour leader - Scottish Labour launched its campaign on Monday, with new leader Anas Sarwar saying the next term of parliament should be focused on recovery - with the health services first in line. Mr Sarwar unveiled plans for \"life-saving\" mental health workers in every GP practice in Scotland. \nLorna Slater - co-leader of the Scottish Greens - The Scottish Greens are basing their campaign on support for independence and a \"green recovery from the pandemic\". Ms Slater has said the party's manifesto will include plans for \u00a37.5bn of investment in public transport, warm homes and renewable energy, creating 100,000 jobs.\nWillie Rennie - Scottish Liberal Democrat leader -  The Scottish Lib Dems say they would \"put recovery first\", arguing there should not be a fresh referendum \"in the wake of a terrible pandemic\". Mr Rennie said his plans included \"cutting waits for mental health, delivering a bounce back plan for education, more jobs and action on the climate\".\nThe BBC considers a number of factors when deciding who takes part in its TV election debates.  One of those factors is based on previous and current electoral support. For example, the parties featuring in Tuesday's broadcast had MSPs elected to Holyrood in 2016. They also have elected representation in other chambers, such as local councils and at Westminster.\nAhead of an election the BBC issues a set of guidelines, which can be found here. They are general rules outlining how the broadcaster will cover things like day-to-day campaigning and debates. Although the leaders of smaller parties will not appear in this live television event there will be impartial and proportionate coverage of their campaigns in the coming weeks. \nNicola Sturgeon and Willie Rennie go into tonight's debate as the most experienced performers.\nMr Rennie has fronted Scottish Liberal Democrat campaigns for a decade, while Nicola Sturgeon has been SNP leader since 2014. Their challenge is to appear fresh when they are so familiar. \nThe others are appearing in this format for the first time.\nAnas Sarwar has only had a month in charge. The Scottish Conservatives appointed Douglas Ross last summer.\nWhile both have questioned Nicola Sturgeon at Holyrood, they have not yet been tested against her or each other on live TV.\nLike the other newcomer - Lorna Slater - they have a big opportunity here to make an impact and energise their campaigns.\nThere is also danger for everyone in the line up. A low key performance or a gaffe could set back their election efforts.\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, voters in Scotland will elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of daily life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and benefits. Defence, foreign and immigration policies are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nQuestions will come from members of the public who represent a range of different political opinions and demographics. However, because of Covid-19 restrictions they will attend virtually.\nThe audience is designed to reflect the broad range of political opinions on many of the issues affecting Scotland. That could be based on voting history, views on big issues like independence, as well as diversity of age, gender, social demographics and geographical location.\nThe production team ask audience members to submit questions and then choose the best and most representative of these - they'll ensure there is a range of political opinions among the questioners. The first time the panel hears each question is when the audience member asks it.\nThroughout the programme, audience members are also given the opportunity to put further points to the panel."

It had an initial worldwide print run of a million copies.\nThe Captain Underpants series includes 12 novels and numerous spin-offs. They are hugely popular with young readers, with more than 80 million copies sold around the world, but are often among the American Library Association's most complained-about books because of their violent imagery.\nScholastic said it had halted publication of the book in question on 22 March with Pilkey's \"full support\".\n\"Together, we recognise that this book perpetuates passive racism,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are deeply sorry for this serious mistake.\"\nPilkey said he would donate the advance and royalties he received for the book to charities that provide books to children in underserved communities, promote diversity in children's book, and fight anti-Asian prejudice.\nThe move comes amid an examination of anti-Asian sentiment in the US following a rise in harassment and hate crimes, and in light of the murders of six Asian women in a shooting in Atlanta earlier this month.\nIt also comes as some children's books and characters are being reassessed. In early March, the company that preserves the legacy of author Dr Seuss said six of his books would no longer be published because of racially insensitive imagery."

His offspring is yet to be named. \nNaturalist and television presenter Iolo Williams welcomed the pair to the reserve near Machynlleth and said it was a \"big day\".\n\"They [beavers] used to be here, they should be here and I would like to see them back on Welsh rivers,\" he added.\n\"They can help tackle important issues like flooding, creation of new habitats - they're an important part of that as environmental engineers.\"\nThere are plans to introduce the rest of the family unit from Scotland in the coming weeks. \n\"This is just the first half of the family with the mother coming shortly,\" said Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer of the Scottish Beaver Trial.\n\"They had all their health screening before they came. You could see on release they were very relaxed and really enjoying their new environment so we are very happy.\"\nIn a separate project, North Wales Wildlife hopes to release 10 pairs of free-roaming beavers into the River Dyfi.\nAlicia Leow-Dyke of the Welsh Beaver Project hoped the mammals would bring a \"tourism boost\" to mid Wales. \nShe said: \"There is a lot of interest around beavers and tourism and we've already had people asking when they can come and see them. \n\"We have seen it with other projects in Scotland and England, there was huge tourism interest that coincided with that work.\""

Although the leaders of smaller parties will not appear in this live television event there will be impartial and proportionate coverage of their campaigns in the coming weeks. \nNicola Sturgeon and Willie Rennie go into tonight's debate as the most experienced performers.\nMr Rennie has fronted Scottish Liberal Democrat campaigns for a decade, while Nicola Sturgeon has been SNP leader since 2014. Their challenge is to appear fresh when they are so familiar. \nThe others are appearing in this format for the first time.\nAnas Sarwar has only had a month in charge. The Scottish Conservatives appointed Douglas Ross last summer.\nWhile both have questioned Nicola Sturgeon at Holyrood, they have not yet been tested against her or each other on live TV.\nLike the other newcomer - Lorna Slater - they have a big opportunity here to make an impact and energise their campaigns.\nThere is also danger for everyone in the line up. A low key performance or a gaffe could set back their election efforts.\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, voters in Scotland will elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of daily life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and benefits. Defence, foreign and immigration policies are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nQuestions will come from members of the public who represent a range of different political opinions and demographics. However, because of Covid-19 restrictions they will attend virtually.\nThe audience is designed to reflect the broad range of political opinions on many of the issues affecting Scotland. That could be based on voting history, views on big issues like independence, as well as diversity of age, gender, social demographics and geographical location.\nThe production team ask audience members to submit questions and then choose the best and most representative of these - they'll ensure there is a range of political opinions among the questioners. The first time the panel hears each question is when the audience member asks it.\nThroughout the programme, audience members are also given the opportunity to put further points to the panel."

We're not angry, we just want to know you're ok'.\"\nMr Okorogheye was last seen boarding the 23 bus southbound in Ladbroke Grove at about 20:45 GMT on 22 March.\nCCTV footage showed he was wearing black clothing and was carrying a black satchel with a white Adidas logo.\nIt is unknown where he got off the bus and police have asked anyone who may have been around Ladbroke Grove at the time to get in touch.\nMs Joel described her son as \"a very civilised boy, he's very focused, intelligent, loved by everyone\". \nShe said: \"We feel he has been taken away - he went to a friend and something happened there.\n\"If anybody has seen Richard, please tell Richard to come home. \n\"Please, tell him to come home.

Everyone says I should be proud of myself but I constantly worry I might mess something up.\"\nHe started smoking cannabis in primary school and, as an adult, said he would take \"anything and everything\" and he \"couldn't cope with life\".\n\"It was a coping mechanism to help me hide and bury my head in the sand.\"\nNow he has his own flat and has given up drugs.\nKirk grew up in care and \"bounced around children's homes in England\" before running away at 16.\nHe ended up sleeping rough in Devon. \nAbout five years ago, he had surgery to remove an abscess on his brain and said his life \"had to change drastically\". \n\"Estranged family brought me back to Cardiff and tried to take care of me, but due to my lifestyle and addiction, I went back to the streets.\"\nOn telling the council he was homeless, he was advised he would have to wait three years for help, despite being born in the city.\nSo he slept in doorways, under bridges and in hostels until lockdown began and he was moved to the Youth Hostel Association (YHA) hostel.\n\"I was thinking I wasn't going to stay, that I'd do what they say and then I'm gone. But I was surprised, I had three meals a day and the staff were brilliant and treated us as equals.\"\nKirk stayed longer in the YHA than any other hostel he had lived in and got help to give up drugs, has started learning Spanish and begun work on his driving theory.\nBeing in his flat is \"scary\" as he said he was looked after at the YHA.\n\"If I had lived with my mum that's what I think it would have been like. But I'm learning. I used an oven for the first time and I can cook omelettes and make fried egg sandwiches.\n\"The next thing I want to make is spaghetti bolognese.\"\nHe has been in touch with his family and hopes to get a job and make his daughter proud.\nKirk was one of 187 rough sleepers Cardiff council has helped into accommodation since March 2020.\nIt said work with not-for-profit groups meant they could offer support for homeless people.\nGareth Edwards is in a team that helps homeless people become more independent and re-engage with society.\n\"We're able to intervene [immediately] and people are able to have a choice of support that's given to them,\" he said.\n\"Some feel they're ready to abstain from substances and there's a substance misuse worker and a counsellor to help them.\n\"If you've got mental health issues there's a community psychiatric nurse on hand. There's always someone there to help them.\"\nNurse Donna-Marie Thomas supports homeless people in south Wales through an organisation she founded, Homeless Hope.\nAged nine, she fled an abusive family and slept rough in London.\n\"People are still running away from abuse and they're still running away from bereavement,\" she said.\n\"I think a lot has been done in a lot of different places and I'd like to see the support continue to help people off the street.\"\nHomeless Hope has not been providing care to people on the streets because of Covid-19 restrictions, but still gets calls for help.\n\"People who haven't got anywhere to go or someone's relative has passed away and now they're out on the street because the council want them out,\" Ms Thomas said.\n\"There are still gaps in what's being provided and there are still people out there.\"\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said: \"We will change the way services and community partners work together so they can help people to cope long before they end up on the street.\n\"Where we can't prevent homelessness, we will ensure that people are supported into a suitable and secure home as soon as possible.\"\nPlaid Cymru's housing spokeswoman, Delyth Jewell, said the party would enshrine \"the right to housing\" in law. \nShe added: \"By the end of the first Senedd term, we will abolish the priority need system, deliver 50,000 social and affordable homes and ensure fair rents for the future.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said the party would \"introduce a 'housing first' model for supporting homeless people, appoint a homelessness commissioner, ideally someone who has experienced homelessness, to work with stakeholders to tackle rough sleeping and its causes in Wales, and immediately bring 150 empty social housing properties back into use specifically for people who are at risk of homelessness.\"\nWelsh Labour said the Welsh government had a \"proud\" record of tackling homelessness and had put more than 7,000 people into temporary accommodation since the start of of the pandemic.\nA spokesman added: \"We will build on the temporary measures we've put in place, grasping this unique opportunity to harness the creativity, innovation, collaboration and willingness to work differently to make a long term, sustainable and fundamental change to homelessness services in Wales.\""

      "text": "The problem of sexual violence and abuse is not just an issue for schools to tackle, say head teachers.\nSocial media companies, parents and the criminal justice system all have a role to play, says the school leaders' union, ASCL.\nASCL boss Geoff Barton says schools work very hard in this area and take these matters extremely seriously. \nHis comments come as the website Everyone's Invited records over 10,000 testimonies of abuse from youngsters.\nThe website was set up last year as a place where victims can post anonymous accounts of abuse they have suffered.\nMany of the accounts describe allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence carried out against young women by young men who are at school, college or university with them, or part of the same social groups.\nEngland's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has described the allegations on the website as \"shocking and abhorrent\" and has pledged to take \"appropriate action\".\nAnd children's charities are calling for the government to issue better guidance to schools and colleges to tackle the problem.\nBut school leaders warn that the problem of sexual violence is a societal issue and cannot solely be left to schools and teachers to address.\n\"Media reporting of these testimonies has focused on the role of schools,\" says Mr Barton.\n\"In fact, these testimonies involve young people, in schools and universities, in a wide variety of circumstances, often outside school premises in settings such as parties.\n\"This is not to minimise the vital responsibility of schools in tackling sexual violence and sexual harassment, and instilling good values in young people and respect for one another.\"\nBut this is \"a wider issue than what happens in schools\", he warns.\n\"Parents have a responsibility to talk to their children about how they behave towards others. Social media companies have a responsibility to take more care about how their platforms are used. The criminal justice system has a responsibility to show young people that it can be trusted to prosecute and bring to justice sexual offenders.\"\nMr Barton also urged young people who had reported sexual offences against them on Everyone's Invited to tell the police.  \nHowever, the Children's Society says schools are not doing enough and calls on ministers to educate school staff, parents, pupils and support services on how better to address abuse in schools.\nPolicy manager Iryna Pona said: \"Young people consistently raise with us the issue of sexual harassment at school and that schools are often not doing enough to tackle it or support victims.\n\"Where young people are acting in sexually harmful ways it's vital that this behaviour is addressed early through specialist support to prevent it escalating into crimes. \n\"Yet all too often no action is taken by schools or social services until a serious offence, such as rape, is committed.\"\nBarnardo's is calling for a review of the existing guidance for schools and colleges on how to address routine sexual harassment and abuse.\nChief executive Javed Khan said he was \"deeply concerned\" at recent reports, saying they were \"just the tip of the iceberg\".\n\"We know that at least a third of identified sexual abuse against under-18s is committed by other children and young people. We also know that much of this abuse goes unreported.\"\nAccording to Chief Constable Simon Bailey, who oversees child protection for the National Police Chiefs' Council, the problem has been partly fuelled by \"easy access to pornography\".\n\"There's an erosion of an understanding of what normal sexual relationships look like,\" he said and urged parents and schools to speak to children about pornography, and tell them it's \"not real\".\nHis view is backed by Dr Elena Martellozzo, associate professor of criminology at Middlesex University, who says children as young as 11 are exposed to porn.\nDr Martellozzo told BBC Radio 4 that pornography was \"very much accessible\" on the internet.\n\"They can come across porn through pop-ups as much as actively seeking it or being shown it,\" she said. \n\"I would say it's harder to avoid online pornography than to seek it. This is not the start of a healthy sexual relationship.\"\nThe government had planned to introduce age checks to stop anyone under 18 accessing pornography, but the plans were eventually dropped over concerns about their effectiveness.\nMargot James, who was digital minister when the plans were being drawn up, said that while the checks could never be completely effective, they were designed to \"deter and reduce access to pornography among young people\".\nShe said internet platforms should be regulated more broadly.\n\"There's a lot more we should be doing,\" she said."

      "text": "Guidance for people in England identified as being \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing?\nFormal advice telling them to take extra care, or \"shield\", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. \nMost coronavirus restrictions are being lifted in England on 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else.\nHowever, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to \"think particularly carefully\" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including:\nThere is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlthough Scotland moves to Covid protection level zero on 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said keeping the mandatory use of face coverings past then would give \"added protection and assurance\" to people who were particularly vulnerable.\nFrom 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace.\nHowever, companies still have legally binding health and safety responsibilities - and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. \nSome firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) is available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. \nYou may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons.\nRead the updated government advice.\nAlthough the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it \"expects and recommends\" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport.\nYou should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. \nThe NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to offer support.\nData shows Covid vaccines are highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection.\nBeing double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. \nYou should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not, book through the NHS website or call 119.\nThe most vulnerable people are likely to be offered booster jabs from September, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. \nYou are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.\nThe pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The government recommends several support websites.\nIf you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on the NHS Shielded Patient List. \nA combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk, including: \nHigh risk categories include people: "

Shops will be allowed to resume click and collect services.\nIn addition, outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds can start again and college students will be able to return to in-person teaching for practical subjects.\nIt is expected that all school pupils will return full-time after the Easter holidays. Those in secondary schools are currently operating under a blended learning system.\nFrom 26 April, all remaining shops should be able to reopen, and indoor gyms and swimming pools will be allowed to open for individual exercise.\nPubs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants will be able to serve people outdoors, and there will be a partial resumption of indoor hospitality.\nNon-essential work in people's homes will resume, as can driving lessons and tests.\nTravel restrictions in Scotland will be lifted entirely and tourist accommodation, museums, galleries and libraries will be able to open.\nThe latest figures reported on Tuesday showed there had been 411 new positive coronavirus cases, 2.8% of all tests, and that a further 12 deaths linked to Covid-19 had been registered.\nA total of 2,436,398 people have now received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, up 26,572 from Monday, and 338,443 have received their second dose. \nMs Sturgeon said the average number of cases had fallen by three quarters since early January, and the number of deaths were down by more than 80% in the last two months.\nScotland's chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said there had been an uptick in cases among the 25 to 44 age group.\nHe said the virus could still have a \"profound effect\" on younger adults and urged people of all age groups to follow government advice."

If not, please telephone or email us to rearrange or cancel at the earliest opportunity,\" she said.\nAt one vaccination centre in Bangor, staff reported more than 100 patients failed to attend their slot over the weekend, with a further 90 not turning up on Monday.\nIn a post on social media, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said the no-shows at Ysbyty Enfys meant many vaccination slots were wasted, and others had to be filled at short notice.\nIn a statement the board said no-shows put a lot of pressure on GP surgeries and the health board, and the vaccination programme needed to be completed as \"swiftly as possible\". \nCwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, responsible for caring for people in some of the communities worst hit by Covid-19, said it was asking those aged 40 to 49 to join a reserve list so \"no vaccine was wasted\" due to missed appointments.\nThe health board's director of planning and performance, Clare Williams, said: \"We have seen over the past couple of weeks, a small number of people fail to show for their appointments which is something we want to address.\n\"No vaccine has been wasted because of this, but the reserve list will make sure we continue to use every single dose available.\"\nThe Hywel Dda University Health Board also said the number of \"did not attend\" (DNA) incidents had increased in recent weeks.\nRos Jervis, director of public health at the board, said: \"As we move through the priority groups, DNA rates have increased a little and vary significantly between mass vaccination centres.\n\"To ensure that no vaccine is ever wasted we currently operate a reserve list for care home, health and social care staff in priority groups 1 and 2 who, for any reason, missed their initial opportunities for vaccination (including new staff).\nIn Powys, the health board has also set up a reserve list for people aged 40 to 49 willing to be called at short notice for an appointment at a mass vaccination centre.\nThe Welsh government said it was looking into why so many people were not attending vaccine appointments, and people needed to ensure their GPs had their correct address.\n\"We recognise the importance of wasting as little of the vaccines as possible,\" a spokesman said.\n\"All health boards have arrangements in place to give others, in the priority groups, the vaccine in the event of no-shows or cancellations. \n\"This has ensured the number of doses unable to be used has been very low, under 1%, significantly below the anticipated levels.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "A group of big names in fashion and retail are campaigning for the government to provide more support for small independent shops.\nThey want the chancellor to offer a \"Shop Out to Help Out\" scheme to get consumers spending again when non-essential shops reopen on 12 April.\nIt would cover 50% of a shopper's costs, up to \u00a310, on Monday to Wednesdays for a month. \nAnd it would only apply at physical stores with fewer than 10 staff. \nThe \"Save The Street\" campaign says independent retailers won't survive without it. The Treasury did not comment on whether it would pursue the idea, but said it had protected \"millions\" of retail jobs during the pandemic.\nThe proposed scheme - which would work like the Eat Out to Help Out restaurant discounts last year - is backed by the likes of beauty entrepreneur Charlotte Tilbury, fashion designer Henry Holland and retail consultant Mary Portas. \n\"We would be kidding ourselves to think that everything will be fine for independent retailers once they reopen on 12 April,\" says Ross Bailey, the entrepreneur leading the campaign.\n\"Now it is the government's responsibility to support these businesses and ensure they are given a fighting chance to bounce back - the government needs to show that all businesses matter, not just big businesses.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium estimates that non-essential retail stores lost around \u00a322bn in sales in 2020 due to lockdown measures, as footfall declined by 40%.\nIndependent shops - many of which lack a strong online presence - were hit particularly hard as they faced prolonged closures and restrictions. \nYet this hasn't stopped people from trying to start businesses. Latest data from Cornerstone Tax, which gives advice on property stamp duty, shows 13% of consumers have started, or intend to start, their own business in 2021.\nThe firm's research also shows more than half of consumers want to support smaller firms over retail giants. \nClare Oakey is the co-founder of Frippery Lifestyle Boutique, an independent fashion and homeware retailer in Colchester. \nShe and her business partner Kim will spend up to \u00a31,000 on reopening promotional activities, including printing a hundred 10%-off discount vouchers for the local barber to give away, putting flower arrangements and sweets in the shop, and offering customers who make a purchase goodie bags.\nMs Oakey says that five retail chain outlets on the same high street will not be reopening on 12 April, along with a number of independent stores. So even though people in Colchester generally like supporting small retailers, more needs to be done to get the public spending on the High Street again.\n\"We've prioritised keeping our business open by paying invoices to suppliers to keep the company running long term, but the honest truth is that it's been financially tough on a very personal level for me and my business partner,\" Clare tells the BBC.\n\"We really badly need the support - any form of help to let us catch up and break even, in terms of a scheme that incentivises the customers. We're nothing without customers.\"\nThe only nice thing, she says, is that local independent businesses have come together to help each other out.  \nFor example, while the Frippery has been closed in the most recent lockdown, a nearby artisan coffee shop, Sir Isaacs Coffee House, has offered a click-and-collect service on its behalf. \nIt meant the Frippery could continue serving its customers online, while the coffee shop got more exposure and hopefully sold a few extra coffees.\nRetail analysts are also seriously concerned about the situation facing Britain's independent shops.\n\"Independent retailers have had a tumultuous year and immediate action is needed to avoid a high street apocalypse,\" says Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail.\nA Shop Out to Help Out Scheme would encourage consumers to \"ditch their screens\" and support their local shops, she says.\n\"This is a unique opportunity to redefine our high streets, but without government support we'll be bracing for a retail bloodbath.\"\nRetail expert Kate Hardcastle agrees, pointing out that independent retailers were the ones who \"really demonstrated their worth\" in the early days of the pandemic in coming to their communities' aid when other retailers didn't have their online shopping offerings ready.\nShe is concerned that everyone will forget about them now.\n\"Just telling people to shop small as has been previous campaigns might serve as a reminder, not an action,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"Just as the case was with Eat Out to Help Out, we need to see our government support small businesses longer term.\n\"I'd love to see initiatives to make it easier for small businesses to open up on the High Street and rejuvenate.\"\nShe says the collaborative approach used by the Frippery and its neighbours is the right one: \"The future of small businesses has to be one of collaboration and not feeling they have to justify their worth to consumers all the time, but being able to focus on a brilliant offer because they can afford to survive.\"\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"We've supported retailers across the UK though out the outbreak, protecting millions of jobs - and will continue to do so in the months ahead. \n\"Shops won't pay any business rates until July, can continue to furlough staff until September, and are receiving Restart Grants of up to \u00a36,000.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson joins more than 20 world leaders in calling for a new global settlement to help the world prepare for future pandemics. In an article for newspapers around the world, leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France and German Chancellor Angela Merkel say Covid has posed the biggest challenge since World War Two. Another pandemic or health crisis is a matter of \"not if, but when\", they say. And the pandemic has shown that \"nobody is safe until everyone is safe\". \nA senior scientist warns the US faces \"impending doom\" as coronavirus cases and hospital admissions rise across the country. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the US public health agency - the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said: \"I'm going to reflect on the reoccurring feeling I have of impending doom,\" adding \"we have so much reason for hope, but right now I'm scared\". She was speaking at a White House briefing when she said she was going to go \"off script\". New Covid cases have reached about 60,000 a day in the past week, a rise of about 7%, according to the CDC. President Joe Biden urged state politicians once again to make mask-wearing obligatory in public places and also promised that by mid-April 90% of American adults would be able to receive a vaccine.\nSir Lenny Henry writes an open letter urging black Britons to get the Covid-19 vaccine and hopes it will help to stop \"disproportionate\" ethnic minority death rates. He says people should \"trust the facts\" and guard against misinformation but blames an \"element of mistrust\" in the system for why the black community is cautious about getting vaccinated. Sir Lenny's letter comes as vaccination rates among black British ethnic groups are considerably lower than among white Britons. The disparity exists despite a widespread study suggesting black people are twice as likely as white people to catch the coronavirus. His appeal has been backed by other high-profile figures, such as actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, musician KSI and actress Thandie Newton, and the NHS.\nReece caught coronavirus during the first wave of the pandemic in March 2020, but like many 20-somethings, he wasn't hospitalised overnight. What he thought would be a mild illness became a protracted nightmare with his partner Alice becoming his carer. Months after his initial infection, he was diagnosed with CFS/ME (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis) by his GP and referred to a specialist. His consultant later confirmed his symptoms were a form of \"long Covid\" and referred him to a long Covid clinic.\nWith restrictions on international flights in place due to Covid-19, many people who normally travel for business have had to come up with alternative ways to have meetings and get deals done. A new facility for business travel has now opened in Singapore - where people fly in, conduct their business meetings in a glass \"bubble\", sign their deals and then fly back home.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has joined more than 20 world leaders in calling for a new global settlement to help the world prepare for future pandemics. \nIn a newspaper article the leaders, including the German chancellor and French president, said Covid posed the biggest challenge since World War Two.\nThe pandemic has shown \"nobody is safe until everyone is safe\", they said.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the UK would need a surplus of vaccines before it could export supplies.\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph and publications such as Le Monde in France and El Pais in Spain, the 24 leaders argue that a treaty similar to that reached in the wake of World War Two is needed to build cross-border cooperation.\nThe signatories, who include the head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: \"At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. \n\"The aims were clear: To bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism, and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation - namely peace, prosperity, health and security.\"\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the other leaders said that in the same spirit, countries must now \"be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion\". \nA new treaty would help to establish better systems for alerting people about potential pandemics, they said, while also improving the sharing of data and distribution of vaccines and personal protective equipment.\n\"There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone. The question is not if, but when. \n\"The Covid-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.\"\nThe letter added: \"At a time when Covid-19 has exploited our weaknesses and divisions, we must seize this opportunity and come together as a global community for peaceful co-operation that extends beyond this crisis.\"\nDr David Nabarro, a special envoy on Covid-19 for the WHO, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that without \"some kind of special action, the world as a whole will not be vaccinated until well into 2022\".\n\"During that time all sorts of problems with variants will emerge, and so all that leaders are saying is 'this problem is so huge we've got to work together to deal with it',\" he added.\nWhile the concept of an international vaccine treaty suggests cosy cooperation, elsewhere there is quite the battle going on between the signatories of this letter over the issue of the blueprints to the new vaccines.\nSouth Africa and India are leading dozens of mainly developing countries seeking a temporary pandemic waiver to global rules protecting the technology and recipes for Covid vaccines. \nWithout these rules, they say they have the capacity to manufacture more vaccine doses.\nOver the past few months, wealthier countries including the UK, the US and the EU have repeatedly blocked a waiver. \nThe argument is that the pharmaceutical companies have performed well in getting a vaccine into arms within a year, and need to be able to have the incentive of making money out of this innovation in years to come.\nThe drugs companies say the bottleneck is not the patents, but the ability to manufacture globally. \nThe big unknown factors here are suggestions that the Biden administration might be about to change sides in this battle for vaccines.\nThat would mark a stunning change, and leave the UK and the EU under pressure to change tack, or at least to put more flesh on the bones of the goal of this treaty - that the pandemic will not be over until it is over for everyone.\nMr Kwarteng told the programme that making vaccines available to other counties \"can happen once we have a surplus of vaccines here in the UK\".\n\"There's still a way to go. We've got to make sure we do everything we can deal with the pandemic and coronavirus in this country,\" he said.\n\"But obviously we want to work in the spirit of co-operation as well, and when we do have surpluses we'll be looking to export those, I'm sure.\"\nThe joint article comes in the wake of disagreement between the UK and the EU over vaccines, after the bloc introduced tougher export controls on jabs produced there.\nThe UK and the World Health Organization warned against blockades, while the EU blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering promised doses. \nAstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract.\nAt a Downing Street briefing on Monday, Mr Johnson announced that tens of millions of doses of the Novavax vaccine would now be produced and packaged in north-east England.\nThe prime minister said a deal had been agreed with GlaxoSmithKline to bottle 60 million doses at its facility in Barnard Castle.\nThe original plan was for the \"fill and finish\" process - by which vaccines are packaged up in vials - to be done in Europe.\nNovavax is currently being assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.\nAlso at the briefing, the PM said the UK did not know \"exactly how strong\" its defences against another wave of Covid would be despite its \"impressive\" vaccine rollout. \nHe was speaking as the stay-at-home rule came to an end in England, allowing groups to meet outdoors. Outdoor sport facilities, including swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses, have reopened, while weddings are also on again.\nMr Johnson warned more deaths, infections and hospitalisations were inevitable as the UK comes out of lockdown.\nBut he also said he could not \"see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the road map\" of easing further restrictions.\nFrom 12 April, shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality will reopen in England, if strict conditions are met.\nA further 4,654 Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Monday, compared with 5,342 cases a week ago. \nThere were another 23 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive test, compared with 17 on the same day last week.\nThe latest figures show 293,542 UK adults received a first dose of the vaccine on Sunday, taking the overall number to 30,444,829 - with 146,785 having their second dose, bringing that total to 3,674,266."

      "text": "A cage fighter has been convicted of murdering his teacher ex-partner after blackmailing her about an unlawful relationship she was having with a 15-year-old boy.\nPaul Robson inflicted fatal head injuries on Caroline Kayll, 47, during a sustained attack on her and the boy at her Northumberland home in November.\nThe boy suffered multiple injuries.\nRobson, 50, of Stanley Street, Wallsend, was also found guilty of attempting to murder the teenager. \nNewcastle Crown Court heard the \"cruel and calculating\" cage fighting coach and former MMA fighter had 21 convictions for 92 offences over more than 30 years.\nHe claimed to have first met Mrs Kayll in 2005 while he was an inmate at a prison where she worked as an education officer.\nAt that point they began a clandestine affair which resumed years later when he was jailed again in 2014 for drug and firearms offences.\nAfter Mrs Kayll left her prison officer husband, Robson moved into her home in Linton, near Ashington, on his release.\nThey split up weeks before the murder when he discovered she was in an illicit sexual relationship with the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons.\nRobson threatened to \"ruin her\" by exposing the relationship and in exchange for his silence, over 10 days in November, Ms Kayll paid him \u00a329,000 and took out a \u00a310,500 loan.\nHowever, on 15 November, Robson drove three hours from Glasgow to Linton, having bought a locksmith's bar, a GPS car tracker, screwdrivers, pliers, a wrench and ammonia.\nThe ex-convict was later caught on CCTV \"prowling\" outside Ms Kyall's house.\nThe court heard that during the \"vicious\" assault Robson kicked his former partner in the head, possibly strangled her, slashed her with a blade, cut off clumps of her hair and cut up her clothes.\nHe also used a variety of knives to attack the boy, sprayed both his victims with ammonia and stole their phones so they could not call for help.\nRobson then fled to Glasgow and remained at large while police made appeals to trace him. Ms Kayll was placed on life support at hospital in Newcastle but died days later.\nHe later blamed her murder on the boy, whom he claimed had attacked him and he injured in self-defence. \nFollowing the conviction, Det Insp Graeme Barr of Northumbria Police described the case as \"one of the most violent offences\" he had ever investigated.\nHe said: \"His attack on Caroline and his teenage victim was pre-meditated and demonstrated horrendous levels of violence.\n\"There is no doubt he wanted to kill or permanently disfigure both of his victims.\n\"He succeeded in killing his former partner and has left his teenage victim scarred for life.\n\"Not only that, but he spent the days that followed trying to avoid police before attempting to pin Caroline's murder on a vulnerable, teenage boy.\n\"There is a very real chance he will never experience freedom again and I hope that can bring some justice to his victims.\"\nRobson will be sentenced on Wednesday.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

It seems like a real joke when people are still struggling.\n\"Staying late, leaving all this rubbish. Every single element of it is completely selfish.\"\nMature student Thomas Scott, who was in the Aboretum on Monday evening, said: \"I felt it was utterly disrespectful.\n\"There were probably 800 to 1,200 people. When they got kicked out everyone left their rubbish on site.\"\nPat Robinson, of the Arboretum Residents' Association, said the main culprits were students. \nShe said: \"We are living on a student campus, and they treat the area appallingly. \n\"I saw so many drunken students, climbing over the railings of the Arboretum, screaming and shouting. There were signs saying no alcohol, but no-one was enforcing it.\"\nThe University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University have both been approached for comment. \nNottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he was working with \"partners\" at Nottingham's universities because \"we think that a good number of the people there [on Monday] were students\".\nHe added: \"Monday was the first day that people could go and meet with more than one other person. \n\"To see that exploited and people behaving in such an unruly fashion is just so disappointing, and it's dangerous to our community.\" \nAs a result of the scenes on Monday, officers were seen stopping people at the Arboretum gates checking bags for alcohol, which is prohibited under a public spaces protection order. \nThe most recent figures show Nottingham had a coronavirus infection rate of 72.7 per 100,000 people in the week up to 26 March - higher than the national average of 54.7.\nFor a period in October, the city also had the highest infection rate in the UK.\nEarlier this month Nottinghamshire Police brought in dispersal orders in Lenton and the Arboretum to prevent further flouting of lockdown rules after reports of anti-social behaviour and house parties.\nAssistant Chief Constable Steve Cooper said: \"While we can of course understand people's desire to want to be out in the sun and enjoying these mild temperatures we are currently experiencing, the government and our health colleagues remain extremely cautious and advise that people continue to minimise social contact.\n\"We would like to remind people that we are still only partly out of lockdown measures.\n\"We are aware of a number of residents choosing to be out in the Arboretum. The behaviour yesterday was unacceptable and we are disappointed people decided to behave in this selfish way. That is why we have now taken the decision to put a dispersal order in place.\n\"It is up to us all to keep to the measures so we can continue on the roadmap out of lockdown, by keeping the virus at bay.\"\nMr Mellen added: \"Over 600 local people have died due to the virus.\n\"We have had discussions with senior police officers and there will be increased presence in our parks.\n\"Drinking alcohol in public spaces is not permitted in Nottingham and will be seized on entry to our parks today.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Rural life,Pubs,Broadband,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Irish pubs could be turned into remote working hubs under a post-pandemic plan to give rural villages a new lease on life. \nThe Irish government scheme is part of a five year rural development policy, released on Monday.\nUnder the plan, a fifth of public servants would shift to remote or home working by the end of the year.\nThe government says it is an invitation to remote workers to live in rural Ireland. \nIt will also introduce legislation this year to give employees the right to request to work remotely.\nThe Irish government's Our Rural Future strategy proposes a national network of 400 remote working hubs, including ones specifically for the public sector. \nIt is the first European country to come up with such a plan. \nRural and Community Development Minister Heather Humphreys said it was \"the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural Ireland in decades\".\n\"As we emerge from Covid-19, the new policy is about maximising a recovery for all parts of the country and giving a better quality of life to people who live and work in rural areas.\"\nConcern about the pre-eminence of Dublin and the need for decentralisation of civil service jobs is a perennial theme in Irish political discourse.\nA previous attempt to move government departments outside of the capital was a failure.\nCivil servants who had bought homes and had children at school in the city were very reluctant to sell-up to move to areas where they may have had no connections.\nBut this time the government is hoping it will be different because the focus will be more on individuals than on civil service departments.\nAnd the pandemic experience of working from home has proved there is such an appetite.\nBut to work broadband speeds in rural areas will need to improve from all too often very slow to superfast - just one of the many challenges the government faces as it looks to a future beyond the pandemic.\nThe report commits to \"explore the potential to develop a pilot scheme to support the use of rural pubs as community spaces and hubs for local services\".\nThe minister likened it to the UK's \"the hub in the pub\" concept. \n\"We are teasing out how, maybe, pubs can be used for different purposes during the day,\" she said. \n\"It could be working spaces. It could be community spaces. It could be many different things and we can look at having high-speed broadband there.\"\nCork South West TD (Irish MP) Michael Collins said such a plan would need high-speed, reliable broadband - which his constituents did not always have, Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported. \nAs part of the new strategy, the government has proposed investing up to \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) in the roll-out of the national broadband plan.\n\"There are huge issues. Many people have come back from the cities to work in rural communities and the broadband is shocking. \n\"I have hundreds and hundreds of people in west Cork pulling their hair out of their heads because they can't get broadband in their homes.\"\nNorthern Ireland's civil service is currently developing an \"enduring\" remote-working policy with trade unions. \nIn February, the Department of Finance announced 10 regional hubs for public sector workers.\nThe Cross Border Workers Coalition welcomed the commitment of ministers \"north and south\" to remote working. \nHowever \"restrictive\" cross border tax rules continued to leave rural communities behind, the organisation's co-chair Aidan O'Kane said.\n\"Under current legislation, cross border workers who live in the Republic of Ireland and work for an Northern Ireland-based company can face a 'double tax' on their income if they work remotely. \n\"Employees should be able to live in towns across the island regardless of where their job is based.\"\nThe Irish government has included a tax review for remote workers and employers as part of its strategy.

      "tags": "Police Service of Northern Ireland",
      "text": "Simon Byrne was appointed as the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in May 2019, but his tenure to date has been notable for a number of setbacks and controversies. \nHe arrived with 36 years of policing behind him - a third of it at high rank, with most of his career having been spent at Merseyside Police.\nMr Byrne held senior positions there - and then the Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police - before his appointment as chief constable of Cheshire in 2014.\nThat job ended in 2017 in controversial circumstances, after he was accused of bullying and humiliating staff.\nHe was cleared of 74 misconduct allegations with a tribunal finding much of what was claimed was either exaggerated or probably did not happen. \nWhen he officially took over from his predecessor Sir George Hamilton on 1 July 2019 - the beginning of a five-year contract - Mr Byrne became the fifth chief constable in the PSNI's history.\nHere's a look at the notable events of his time as chief constable so far: \nSimon Byrne is appointed the PSNI's new chief constable, replacing the outgoing Sir George Hamilton.\nThe other candidates for the top policing job were Steve Martin and Mark Hamilton, both PSNI officers, and Jon Boutcher, the head of Bedfordshire Police.\nThe head of the Policing Board says that Mr Byrne \"brings a wealth of strategic and operational experience to the post\".\nAlthough not a contractual requirement, Mr Byrne decides to move to Northern Ireland from England, tweeting that he looked forward to living \"full-time in Northern Ireland as an active member of the community\".\nMr Byrne is criticised for suggesting the children of paramilitaries could be taken into care.\nHe clarifies his remarks afterwards saying he was \"not suggesting children can be used as weapons in the fight against paramilitary crime\".\nThe chief constable first made the comments at a conference on the use of stop and search powers.\nHe said his message to paramilitaries was: \"You carry on doing this and we will have your house, if you keep going we will have your car, we will have your kids, we will have your benefits and we will put you in jail.\"\nMr Byrne says he was happy to withdraw \"the interpretation that children are pawns, if that's what's been heard\", adding it was not his intention.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Kelly calls the original remarks \"unacceptable\" and says the comments had caused \"deep worry\". \nMr Byrne apologises after tweeting a photo of himself with officers holding rifles outside a PSNI station in Crossmaglen on Christmas Day.\nSome nationalist politicians criticise him, saying the image is offensive to the local community.\nIn a statement in January 2020, Mr Byrne says his message was \"never meant as a comment on the community of Crossmaglen and South Armagh\".\n\"I am sorry for any offence that has been caused,\" he adds.\nThe PSNI launches a new recruitment campaign, backed by First Minister Arlene Foster, and notably, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nMr Byrne says the attendance of Ms O'Neill at its launch got it off to \"the best possible start\".\nIt came amid continued concerns over the PSNI's ability to increase its numbers of Catholic officers.\nSinn F\u00e9in has historically been critical of the role of the police in Northern Ireland, both with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which replaced it in 2001.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says her attendance at the recruitment campaign launch \"speaks volumes\".\n\"We need a PSNI that is reflective in terms of the community in which it serves,\" she said.\nThe PSNI saw numbers rise from 6,900 to 7,100.\nHowever, the Northern Ireland Executive soon found itself swamped by other financial priorities as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\nSimon Byrne is forced to backtrack on a proposal to \"tinker\" with the force's badge on uniforms, admitting the idea was \"a non-starter\".\nAs part of a branding refresh, he had publicly floated the idea of a modified emblem.\nIt would have removed the words Police Service Northern Ireland from the badge used on signs, vehicles and uniforms.\nUnionist parties and the Police Federation strongly opposed the idea.\nFollowing the death of George Floyd in the US, Black Lives Matter protests take place in Londonderry and Belfast on 6 June.\nBetween 60 and 70 fines are issued to those attending the anti-racism demonstrations, provoking accusations of inconsistency in the PSNI's approach to Covid-19 regulations.\nCovid-19 lockdown measures in place at the time banned people gathering in groups.\n\"On any other day, this police service would be standing right beside the organisers to facilitate their protest and their right to have their voices heard about the unjustifiable and unnecessary death of George Floyd,\" says Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd.\nOrganisers say efforts were made to maintain social distancing between those in attendance at the protests, which took place at Belfast's Custom House Square and the Guildhall in Derry.\nThe funeral of IRA man Bobby Storey takes place in west Belfast on 30 June, with images of huge numbers lining the streets in a period of strict Covid-19 regulations. \nFootage of the funeral causes huge controversy.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill is among the mourners and her attendance leads to the biggest crisis in NI politics since devolution was restored in January 2020. \nMs O'Neill was part of the funeral cortege, which Sinn F\u00e9in said included no more than 30 people,\nCritics suggest social distancing was not maintained among the crowds which lined the streets as the hearse drove by, nor by the large groups of people who walked behind the hearse at a greater distance.\nLockdown regulations at the time stated a maximum of 30 people were allowed to gather together outdoors. \nNo arrests are made by the PSNI for breaches of coronavirus regulations, but police begin an investigation.\nA number of arrests are made in Operation Arbacia, a MI5-PSNI counter-terrorism operation targeting the alleged leadership of the New IRA.\nTo date, nearly 50 charges have been brought against 10 individuals who have been remanded in custody. \nThe New IRA formed in 2012 and is said to have about 500 supporters and fewer than 100 prepared to plan and carry out attacks, principally against the police.\nIn 2019, it murdered journalist Lyra McKee during disorder in Londonderry.\nA PSNI investigation into potential Covid-19 breaches at Mr Storey's funeral is completed, with a file submitted to public prosecutors. \nTwenty-four people are interviewed as part of the investigation, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nDeputy chief constable of Cumbria, Mark Webster, is brought in by the PSNI to oversee and direct inquiries. \nUnionists are critical of the pace of the investigation.\nSimon Byrne apologises after the Police Ombudsman found justification in claims the handling of the Black Lives Matter protests was unfair and discriminatory.\nA report by Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson states it was \"not intentional and not based on race or ethnicity\".\nHowever, confidence in policing among some in minority communities has been \"severely damaged\", it says.\nMr Byrne says: \"The time is right to show some humility and say sorry.\"\nSimon Byrne apologises over the PSNI's handling of a commemoration event to mark the anniversary of a gun attack, in which five people were murdered by loyalists.\nAn officer was suspended and another redeployed after a man was arrested at the event.\nSimon Byrne acknowledged questions over his future at a news conference but said he would not quit.\n\"Clearly that's the question on everybody's lips, but I'm not a quitter.\"\nThe Public Prosecution Service announces it has not recommended prosecution for anyone concerned in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey.\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over the attendances at the funeral.\nHe added that the \"lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police\" would \"pose an insurmountable difficulty\" if prosecutions were brought.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster calls for Mr Byrne to resign, arguing that his position was now \"untenable\".\nSpeaking to the press later, Mr Byrne says he would not resign."

      "text": "A French drug maker has been found guilty of aggravated deceit and involuntary manslaughter over a weight loss pill at the centre of a major health scandal.\nThe drug Mediator was developed for use in overweight diabetics and was on the market for 33 years.\nIt was eventually withdrawn in 2009 over concerns it could cause serious heart problems.\nHundreds of people are believed to have died as a result of the drug.\nAround five million people were prescribed the medicine over the course of three decades, despite various warnings over its side effects.\nThousands of plaintiffs were involved in the trial, which began in 2019.\nDrug maker Servier had denied any knowledge of Mediator's side effects but a court on Monday issued it with a fine of  \u20ac2.7m (\u00a32.3m, $3.2m).\n\"Although they knew about the risks for many years... they never took the necessary measures,\" judge Sylvie Daunis said.\nThe company's former deputy chairman, Jean-Philippe Seta, was also given a four-year suspended prison sentence.\nFrance's medical regulator, meanwhile, was fined more than \u20ac300,000 for its role in the scandal. The judge found the body had \"seriously failed\" in its duties, according to the AFP news agency.\nAhead of Monday's verdict, French pulmonologist Dr Ir\u00e8ne Frachon, who is credited with exposing the drug's side effects, told AFP that she hoped the ruling would \"give us the tools to understand how such deceit could have gone on for so long\".\nA number of other European countries, including Italy and Spain, banned Mediator in the early 2000s.\nIn France, however, it continued to be offered to diabetics and other patients as an appetite suppressant.\nOne study concluded that 500 deaths could be linked to Mediator between 1976 and 2009. A second one put the figure at 2,000."

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "text": "\u2018Fake' accounts claiming to be Amazon workers have been praising their working conditions on Twitter.\nVotes are currently being counted in Alabama to decide whether Amazon warehouse workers will form a union.\nBut last night, a series of anti-union tweets were sent from accounts claiming to be staff.\nTwitter has now suspended many of the accounts, and Amazon has confirmed at least one is fake.\nMost of the accounts were made just a few days ago, often with only a few tweets, all related to Amazon.\n\u201cWhat bothers me most about unions is there\u2019s no ability to opt out of dues,\u201d one user under the handle @AmazonFCDarla tweeted, despite a state law in Alabama which prevents this.\n\u201cAmazon takes great care of me,\u201d she added.\nAnother account - which later changed its profile picture after it was revealed to be fake - said: \u201cUnions are good for some companies, but I don\u2019t want to have to shell out hundreds a month just for lawyers!\u201d\nMany of the accounts involved used the handle @AmazonFC followed by a first name.\nAmazon has previously used this handle for its so-called Amazon Ambassadors  - real employees who are paid by the firm to promote and defend it on Twitter.\nAn Amazon spokesperson told the BBC that Darla was not an official Ambassador, but has not responded to the BBC\u2019s request for clarification on several other accounts.\n\u201cIt appears that this is a fake account that violates Twitter\u2019s terms,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked Twitter to investigate and take appropriate action.\u201d\nSeveral of the high-profile accounts have been suspended by Twitter. It told the BBC that Amazon Ambassadors are subject to Twitter's rules on spam and platform manipulation.\nAccounts which impersonate or falsely claim to be affiliated with a company, can be temporarily suspended or removed.\nAny parody account should have a disclaimer in its Twitter bio, the company added.\nIt is unclear whether the accounts are real employees, bots or trolls pretending to be Amazon Ambassadors.\nAmazon\u2019s executives and its official accounts have been tweeting in defence of the company in recent days, after negative reports of poor working conditions, including staff having to urinate in bottles.\nThe official Amazon News account tweeted: \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. \n\u201cThe truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one.\u201d\nIn response to a tweet by US Democrat senator Elizabeth Warren, which accused Amazon of \u201cexploiting loopholes and tax havens\u201d, the account said:\n\u201cYou make the tax laws, we just follow them. If you don\u2019t like the laws you\u2019ve created, by all means change them. \n\u201cHere are the facts: Amazon has paid billions of dollars in corporate taxes over the past few years alone.\u201d"

      "text": "Chief Constable Simon Byrne has said \"widespread violence and disorder\" would have followed any attempt to disperse large crowds attending the funeral of senior IRA figure Bobby Storey.\nMr Byrne defended how it was handled and said the investigation into potential breaches of health regulations was \"in its end stages\".\nHe also acknowledged \"hurt\" had been caused by the policing of Black Lives Matter protests.\nHowever Mr Byrne declined to apologise.\nThere have been lingering criticisms of how the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) dealt with the events, which occurred in June amid curbs on large gatherings.\nLast month, a report by the Policing Board found police actions at the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Belfast and Londonderry may have been unlawful in preventing legitimate protest.\nIn an interview with BBC News NI, Mr Byrne said he was not prepared to apologise at this stage.\nReferring to a continuing Police Ombudsman investigation, he said: \"If in the fullness of time we have got things wrong I will come out and say so.\n\"The time to do apologies is when we have got the total picture.\"\nHe has announced a new community relations task force, which will work to build a better bond with ethnic minorities.\nAbout 1,800 people attended Mr Storey's funeral in west Belfast.\nPolice largely stayed away, leaving Sinn F\u00e9in stewards in charge of mourners, who included several of its ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, one of 24 people under investigation, later admitted the public health message had been undermined.\nMr Byrne said the PSNI had not abdicated its responsibilities.\n\"We are in nobody's pocket, we do not collude with anybody, we just have to use discretion which is at the heart of our policing style.\"\nHe said it was \"not appropriate\" to comment on what the police and Sinn F\u00e9in had discussed in advance of the funeral.\nSinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald had previously said it had been \"meticulously\" planned with the PSNI.\nAcknowledging there was no review or investigation into police actions that he was aware of, Mr Byrne said: \"I am limited about what I can say at the moment.\n\"I do not want to be drawn about who said what, to who and when, just at this point in time.\n\"It is absolutely right to ask the question, but it would be best answered in a few weeks.\"\nMeanwhile, the Sinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Kelly said it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest that widespread violence would have followed any police action to disperse mourners at the funeral. \nThe North Belfast assembly member said remarks by Mr Byrne had caused hurt to Mr Storey's family.\nBoth the DUP and Ulster Unionists have said Mr Byrne must reveal more about what discussions police had with Sinn F\u00e9in in advance of June's funeral, \n\"You just do get a sense that they're pandering towards Sinn F\u00e9in in some way,\" Ulster Unionist assembly member Doug Beattie said. \n\"This business that if it was broken up there'd be a threat of violence - the threat of violence from who? From the people, organised violence? Spontaneous violence?\"\nDUP MP Carla Lockhart said: \"The chief constable has openly admitted that the threat of public violence and disorder dictated the policing response to the Storey funeral. \n\"It is humiliating that the enforcers of law and order in Northern Ireland should bow to such a threat.\"  \nThis story was amended on 28 January 2021 to remove the phrase 'IRA veteran'"
