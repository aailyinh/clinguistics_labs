      "text": "People who took part in trials of Covid vaccines which haven't been approved yet will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say.\nThis means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad.\nAn eight-week gap is needed between the third and fourth doses.\nThe NHS Covid app will also be altered to permit travel after the extra two doses.\nThe move, announced by the Department of Health in England, has been developed with the help of the UK's vaccine committee and investigators who worked on the clinical trials.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland health teams are expected to follow suit in their regions.\nAlthough people who signed up to Covid vaccine trials are recognised as fully-vaccinated in the UK - even if the vaccine has not been approved by the UK regulator - many other countries are not allowing them to enter.\nAnd many volunteers had complained this put them at a disadvantage through no fault of their own.\nDarren Green, aged 51 and his wife Linda, 59, who live in south Wales, were volunteers in the Novavax trial.\nLinda was given a placebo rather than the vaccine and has since received two doses of an approved Covid jab, meaning she is free to travel.\nDarren, however, is not, because he received Novavax in the trial.\nHe says it is a relief to know he can now get the travel vaccines.\n\"I felt a bit emotional when I heard the news. It's a big weight off my mind. \n\"I'll be able to go out and do what other vaccinated people can. We have a trip planned with friends. I thought I was going to have to cancel.\"\nOn the prospect of needing more doses, Darren said: \"Apart from feeling a bit like a pin cushion, I'm absolutely delighted.\"\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said when volunteers started taking part in vaccine trials, the UK had no idea which vaccines would succeed or that vaccines would be needed for travel abroad.\nHe said the UK wanted to support them, given \"the sacrifice they made to help others\".\nHe said they must be able to travel \"for deeply personal and important reasons\".\n\"We hope it will be a solution for triallists - as they so richly deserve,\" he said.\nVaccine trial volunteers, starting with those who had Novavax, will be offered one-to-one counselling before they decide whether to have further doses of an approved Covid vaccine. Novavax volunteers will be offered two doses of Pfizer, eight weeks apart.\nBut they can decide to wait for the vaccine they've already had to be approved in the coming months, if they don't have a travel deadline.\nLike others in the UK, people in the trials will be offered a booster jab, if eligible.\nTrials on the safety of administering four doses of different Covid vaccines have not been carried out, but vaccine experts say they do \"not expect any major safety concerns\".\nIn January, UK trials of the Novovax vaccine showed it was nearly 90% effective but the company has not yet applied for approval.\nThe UK has ordered 60 million doses of the vaccine which were set to be made in north-east England.\nThe government said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the vaccine taskforce were working with vaccine companies to ensure their vaccines were authorised as soon as possible if they met the required safety and quality standards.\nAround 52,000 people are taking part in clinical trials across the UK, with 21,000 given a vaccine not yet approved for widespread use. Novavax and Valneva vaccine trial volunteers make up the majority of people in this group.\nThe UK's contract with French firm Valneva was recently cancelled by the UK government."

      "text": "Job vacancies are nearing an all-time high and Scotland has seen a surge in employment, despite warnings that the number of candidates has \"plummeted\".\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland's report on jobs recorded the third-sharpest growth of new appointments on record.\nBut the survey of businesses in September found the second-fastest decline of applicants for permanent jobs since records began in 2008.\nFirms cited Brexit and pandemic uncertainty as the key factors.\nCandidates for temporary jobs decreased for the seventh consecutive month, although the decline slowed from the substantial drop in August, according to the bank's report.\nStarting salaries for people in new jobs and the hourly rate for temporary workers both rose once again, although so did the rate of inflation.\nThe industries with the highest rate of vacancies were the IT and computing sectors, followed by engineering and construction, and then the accountancy and financial sectors.\nMeanwhile, the hotel and catering industries had the fastest rise in demand for temporary staff, followed by IT and computing.\nScottish government External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson told BBC Good Morning Scotland that Brexit was to blame for much of the challenges in the labour market.\nHe said: \"It's part of the more general population challenge that we have in Scotland, it's that Brexit has turned off the tap, seen a significant number of people return to the European continent, and there are simply not enough people living here to fill important roles in our economy.\n\"The UK government is pretending that this is not a serious problem and is certainly denying that Brexit has a significant role in it.\"\nMr Robertson met immigration minister Kevin Foster this week, but said he refused to agree to any of the \"top level\" requests from the Scottish government, including a 24-month worker visa programme.\nBoris Johnson has previously said he is \"not worried\" about the current jobs gap and rising prices in the UK, saying supply chains will sort themselves out \"rapidly\".\nThe prime minister has said the economy was facing the \"stresses and strains\" of a post-Covid recovery.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland said labour shortages were likely to become more pronounced over the coming months, possibly posing \"significant challenges\" for companies hoping to fill roles and expand their operations.\nThe bank's chief economist Sebastian Burnside, said: \"Scotland saw a further rapid uplift in hiring activity during September, with the rates of increase in both permanent placements and temp billings easing only slightly from the all-time records seen in August.\n\"This rounded off a third quarter of unprecedented hiring activity as the Scottish labour market continues to rebound.\n\"Meanwhile, vacancies for both short-term and permanent staff rose at near-record rates during September, but recruiters widely reported skills shortages as the supply of candidates continued to plummet.\""

      "text": "Journalists Maria Ressa, from the Philippines, and Dmitry Muratov, from Russia, have won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their \"efforts to safeguard freedom of expression\".\nWhy are the organisation's prizes so prestigious, and who are some of the previous winners?\nFormer US President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, for \"his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples\".\nPresident Obama said he was \"surprised and deeply humbled\" and would use it as a \"call to action\". However, there was criticism of his award, especially as he had only been in office for 12 days before the nomination deadline.\nOther notable winners include former US President Jimmy Carter (2002); child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the European Union (2012); the United Nations and its then-general-secretary, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001); and Saint Teresa of Calcutta (1979).\nAlbert Einstein (physics 1921),Marie Curie (physics 1903 and chemistry 1911), and Harold Pinter (literature 2005) have also received Nobel prizes.\nTwo people - author and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1964 and Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho in 1973 - rejected the prize, and four others were forced to decline by their countries.\nIn 2016, there was uncertainty over whether singer Bob Dylan would accept the literature award before he finally delivered his lecture for the prize in June 2017.\nThe Nobel prizes are a series of annual awards given in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace.\nThey are awarded to people \"who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind\" in the previous 12 months.\nThe quote is from the will of Swedish businessman - and inventor of dynamite - Alfred Nobel. He left most of his fortune in a fund to launch the awards, which were first presented in 1901.\nIn 1968, an economic sciences prize was added by Sweden's central bank, although it does not count as a Nobel prize.\nDifferent organisations award the prize in each category every year. Five of the six are chosen in Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is selected in Norway. \nAcademics, university professors, scientists, previous winners and others all submit nominations. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, the shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years. \nPrize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece.\nMore than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize.\nThere have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars.\nAnd Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year.\nThe recipient of each prize receives three things:\nThe prizes are presented at ceremonies on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, in Stockholm and Oslo.\nMarie and Pierre Curie used their physics prize money in 1903 for further scientific research, and 2006 physics winner John Mather donated his cash to his foundation.\nIn 1993, British biochemist Richard Roberts spent his medicine winnings on a croquet lawn, while fellow 1993 laureate Phillip Sharp bought a 100-year-old Federal-style house. The 2001 medicine winner, Sir Paul Nurse, bought himself a high-end motorbike.\nMeanwhile, 2006 literature laureate Orhan Pamuk established a museum in Istanbul."

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPeople are being urged to get a flu vaccine - available free to 40 million across the UK - with the head of the UK Health Security Agency warning immunity levels are likely to be lower this year, given social distancing and lockdown meant so little of the virus circulated last year. \"This is the first winter where we will have seasonal flu and Covid co-circulating,\" says Dr Jenny Harries. Research shows those infected with both are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone.\nAirlines are reporting a surge in bookings since 47 countries, including South Africa, Mexico and Thailand, were removed from the UK's red list of overseas destinations requiring hotel quarantine on return. But industry body Abta wants the government to implement plans to replace costly PCR Covid tests in time for half-term - something the Welsh government is cautioning against.\nFootballer Marcus Rashford says receiving an honorary doctorate for campaigning around child poverty was \"bittersweet\", coming as the \u00a320 top-up to universal credit ended. Accepting the award from the University of Manchester, the England forward said removing the temporary increase \"could see child poverty rise to one-in-three children\". No 10 says the top-up was designed to help in the pandemic's toughest times.\nThe number of patients waiting indefinitely for NHS surgery in Scotland is becoming a \"human tragedy\", an Edinburgh Royal Infirmary doctor says. With health boards having cancelled routine operations to make space for Covid patients and the seriously ill, Dr Caroline Whitworth says bed occupancy is consistently at 100%, with \"thousands\" in pain awaiting procedures.\nIn their bids to become UK City of Culture 2025, applicants had to explain how the opportunity could help their areas recover from the impact of Covid.

      "text": "Adele says her new album was recorded to help her eight-year-old son understand why she and his father got divorced.\n\"I wanted to explain to him through this record, when he's in his twenties or thirties, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,\" the star told Vogue.\n\"It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal,\" she added.\nThe 33-year-old pop superstar has given separate interviews to Vogue's British and American editions - her first for five years - as she prepares to release her highly anticipated fourth album.\nIt will be titled 30 - which is the age at which she married her long-term partner Simon Konecki, and then left him.\n\"My entire life fell apart and I had no warning of it,\" said the singer, acknowledging that she had \"bit off a grenade\" and threw it into her marriage.\nOn Tuesday, she released a short snippet of her forthcoming single, titled Easy On Me, which will be released in full on Friday, 15 October.\nExplaining the lyrics, in which she sings \"Go easy on me...\", Adele said: \"It's not like anyone's having a go at me, but it's like, I left the marriage. Be kind to me as well.\n\"It was the first song I wrote for the album and then I didn't write anything else for six months after because I was like, 'OK, well, I've said it all.\"\nAs she worked on the rest of the album, the music became a method of explaining things to their son Angelo when he's older, she said.\nOne song, described by Vogue as \"an absolute belter of a relationship takedown\", is \"obviously about stuff that happened,\" Adele said, \"but I wanted to put it on the album to show Angelo what I expect him to treat his partner like, whether it be a woman or a man or whatever. \n\"After going through a divorce, my requirements are sky-high. There's a very big pair of shoes to fill.\"\nDespite previous reports that the often-secretive singer had married Konecki in 2016, she told the magazine they did not tie the knot until 2018.\n\"The timeline the press have of my relationship, my marriage, is actually completely wrong,\" she said. \"We got married when I was 30\u2026 and then I left.\"\nShe didn't reveal how long it was until they separated, but said: \"It wasn't very long.\" She filed for divorce in 2019.\n\"It just wasn't right for me any more,\" she explained. \"I didn't want to end up like a lot of other people I knew. I wasn't miserable miserable, but I would have been miserable had I not put myself first. But, yeah, nothing bad happened or anything like that.\"\nKonecki now lives across the road from his ex-wife, and the pair share custody of Angelo.\nThe singer told the US magazine: \"If I can reach the reason why I left, which was the pursuit of my own happiness, even though it made Angelo really unhappy - if I can find that happiness and he sees me in that happiness, then maybe I'll be able to forgive myself for it.\"\nIn the interviews, the pop superstar also addressed her weight loss, after Instagram photos of her slim figure became a talking point.\n\"My body's been objectified my entire career. It's not just now,\" she said. \"I understand why it's a shock. I understand why some women especially were hurt. Visually I represented a lot of women. But I'm still the same person.\"\nShe added: \"The most brutal conversations were being had by other women about my body. I was very... disappointed with that. That hurt my feelings.\"\nThe star also addressed the occasion where she was accused of cultural appropriation, by sharing a photo of her wearing a traditional African hairstyle to mark what would have been the Notting Hill Carnival in 2020.\n\"I could see comments being like, 'The nerve to not take it down,' which I totally get,\" she said. \"But if I take it down, it's me acting like it never happened. And it did. I totally get why people felt like it was appropriating.\nShe said her thought process at the time had been: \"If you don't go dressed to celebrate the Jamaican culture - and in so many ways we're so entwined in that part of London - then it's a little bit like, 'What you coming for, then?'\"\nBut with hindsight she admitted: \"I didn't read the... room.\" "

      "tags": "Companies,Steel industry,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "The government has failed to find solutions to halt soaring energy prices, UK Steel boss Gareth Stace has said.\nHe was speaking after leaders of energy-intensive industries met with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.\n\"We can't wait until Christmas and beyond. Or even a few weeks. We need action now, it needs to be swift, decisive action,\" Mr Stace said.\nThe government said it was exploring ways to manage high energy costs.\nGas prices have risen 250% since January, pushing up costs dramatically.\nMr Stace told the BBC that Mr Kwarteng had listened but had provided \"no immediate solutions or guarantees\".\nThe UK Steel director general said he was \"baffled\" because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry, although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK.\nRepresentatives from energy-intensive sectors including paper, glass, cement, lime, ceramics, chemicals and steel were at Friday's talks with the business secretary.\nThe Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) said it hoped the government would find ways to support those sectors.\nMr Kwarteng told the business representatives he would continue to work with them to tackle the problem. \nHis department said the government would assess the options put forward by the industry, with his spokesperson saying: \"We recognise the recent increase in global gas prices will be a cause of concern for businesses in the UK.\n\"We are in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of rising global prices.\"\nMr Kwarteng also stressed government confidence in the security of gas supplies this winter.\nAfter the meeting, EIUG chair Richard Leese said the government had made \"positive first steps to develop practical solutions\".\n\"EIUG will work with government to avoid threats both to the production of essential domestic and industrial products, as well an enormous range of supply chains critical to our economy,\" he said.\nAndrew Large, director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, said there were \"serious\" risks factories could stop operating as a result of the gas prices being too high.\nThere have already been stoppages at fertiliser and steel plants due to high energy costs.\nHowever, he said the business secretary appeared to share industry's desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption.\nOn Thursday Mr Kwarteng said the government's strategy to shift to \"clean\" power sources by 2035, including wind, solar and nuclear, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n\"The volatility of the gas price has shown we do need to plan strategically and net zero helps us do that,\" he said.\nSpeaking before the meeting, Mr Stace had said if the government failed to act it could \"strangle steel production\" in the UK.\nA crisis in steel production as a result of high energy prices would affect the wider economy, he added, saying the government should consider taking additional action in the short term.\n\"We're pausing production already in terms of some steel producers in the UK.... and it's going to happen more often unless something is done, or the energy market corrects itself and I don't think that will happen any time soon.\"\nHe said the government should address the disparity in energy costs for UK steel makers who he said were paying 50-80% more for electricity than German producers.\nOther countries, such as Italy and Portugal, had \"committed billions of euros\" to address the rising cost of gas, he added. \n\"If the government does nothing then tomorrow, there'll be a steel crisis, and given in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel is, but for the UK economy as a whole,\" he said.\nThe price of wholesale gas has soared since the start of the year. And the UK has lower levels of gas stored than other European countries, which could help cushion price volatility.\nDomestic customers' bills are partly protected from these sharp rises by a price cap, managed by the regulator Ofgem, which limits how far and how fast bills can rise.\nNevertheless, UK households have felt the impact after the price cap was raised at the start of October.\nCustomers will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, regulator Ofgem has warned.\nThe cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April.\nIt applies to households in England, Scotland and Wales this month.\nHouseholds in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain."

      "text": "Manchester United star Marcus Rashford said receiving an honorary doctorate for his work to tackle child poverty was \"bittersweet\" as it came as the \u00a320 top-up to universal credit ended.\nAccepting the award from the University of Manchester, he said removing the temporary increase \"could see child poverty rise to one-in-three children\".\nMr Rashford called for an end to what he said was a \"child hunger pandemic\".\nNo 10 said the top-up was designed to help in the pandemic's toughest times.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised Mr Rashford's \"very, very powerful\" comments and said the government was now \"effectively turning on the poorest\".\nHe promised a Labour government would retain the \u00a320 uplift pending an overhaul of the benefits system, including the abolition of universal credit.\n\"It would stay, we wouldn't make the cut, we would then replace it with something better,\" he said.\nMr Rashford, 23, became the university's youngest recipient of an honorary award at a special ceremony at his club's Old Trafford stadium on Thursday.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, he said the situation many now found themselves in \"reminds me of... when I was younger\".\nThe England forward added: \"You've got to decide between - are you going to eat or are you going to be warm in the house? \n\"These are decisions that you don't want people to go through, never mind children. \n\"And there's other stuff, the price of fuel and electricity and there's actually a shortage of food at the moment... as some of the food banks I work with are experiencing.\n\"So there's other things that people are worrying about and, if we can take one less stress off them, it's important.\"\nMr Rashford said receiving the honorary doctorate was \"bittersweet\" since it came as \"millions of families across the UK lost a lifeline and a means of staying afloat\".\nThe \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit, which was brought in to support those on low incomes during the pandemic, was withdrawn on Tuesday. \nMr Rashford urged MPs to meet those who had been receiving the increased benefit.\n\"It's time that representatives got out into communities like mine,\" he said. \"It's time they saw first-hand the true measure of struggle. \n\"Covid-19 can no longer be used as an excuse.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"If you want to carry on with that uplift you need to find \u00a36bn from somewhere.\n\"Inevitably that means taxing people on their PAYE, maybe putting the cost of fuel up even more, even though it's at record levels or something else.\n\"Nothing is free when you're making these decisions.\"\nIn June 2020, Mr Rashford called on the government to reverse a decision not to provide free school meal vouchers, saying that \"the system isn't built for families like mine to succeed\".\nHe was later made an MBE for services to vulnerable children.\nIn September, it was announced pupils starting media studies GCSEs would study the impact of his campaigning.\nAuthor and broadcaster Lemn Sissay, the university's chancellor, said Mr Rashford being honoured was a \"highlight\" of his tenure. \nManchester United's former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who was previously honoured by the university, joined Mr Rashford's family and friends at the ceremony.\nThe striker said \"to be in the presence of a great such as Sir Alex\", and the people who had \"played a huge role in my journey\" was \"special\".\nManchester United's chief operating officer Collette Roche said the club was \"so proud\".\n\"He is a young man who embodies everything which this club stands for,\" she said.\n\"He is humble, he is passionate and he is driven to succeed in everything he does.\"\nA Downing Street spokesperson said the universal credit top-up was always a \"temporary measure, designed to help claimants through the toughest stages of the pandemic\".\n\"But we are now seeing our economy starting to bounce back so our focus is rightly on helping people back into high-quality, well-paid jobs,\" they said.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Companies,Tax,OECD,Tax avoidance,Income tax",
      "text": "Most of the world's nations have signed up to a historic deal to ensure big companies pay a fairer share of tax. \nA hundred and thirty six countries agreed to enforce a corporate tax rate of at least 15% and a fairer system of taxing profits where they are earned.\nIt follows concern that multinational companies are re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions.\nCountries including Ireland had opposed the deal but have now agreed to the policy. \nUK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the deal would \"upgrade the global tax system for the modern age\".\n\"We now have a clear path to a fairer tax system, where large global players pay their fair share wherever they do business,\" he said.\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organisation, has led talks on a minimum rate for a decade.\nIt said the deal could bring in an extra $150bn (\u00a3108bn) of tax a year, bolstering economies as they recover from Covid. \nYet it also said it did not seek to \"eliminate\" tax competition between countries, only to limit it. \nThe floor under corporate tax will come in from 2023. Countries will also have more scope to tax multinational companies operating within their borders, even if they don't have a physical presence there. \nThe move - which is expected to hit digital giants like Amazon and Facebook - will affect firms with global sales above 20 billion euros (\u00a317bn) and profit margins above 10%.\nA quarter of any profits they make above the 10% threshold will be reallocated to the countries where they were earned and taxed there.\n\"[This] is a far-reaching agreement which ensures our international tax system is fit for purpose in a digitalised and globalised world economy,\" said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. \n\"We must now work swiftly and diligently to ensure the effective implementation of this major reform.\" \nThis deal marks a sweeping change in approach when it comes to taxing big global companies.\nIn the past, countries would frequently compete with one another to offer an attractive deal to multinationals. It made sense when those companies might come in, set up a factory and create jobs. They were, you could say, giving something back.\nBut the new digital era giants have become adept at simply moving profits around, from the regions where they do business to those where they will pay the lowest taxes. Good news for tax havens, bad news for everyone else.\nThe new system is meant to minimise opportunities for profit shifting, and ensure that the largest businesses pay at least some of their taxes where they do business, rather than where they choose to have their headquarters.  \nSome 136 countries have signed up - an achievement in itself. But inevitably there will be losers as well as winners. \nIreland, Hungary and Estonia - all of which have corporate tax rates below 15% - at first resisted the plan but are now on board. \nIreland currently has a rate of 12.5%, which has helped it attract large amounts of foreign investment and become a base for big US firms such as Apple. But after securing a compromise on the wording of the agreement, Finance Minister Pascal Donohoe said he was \"absolutely certain\" Ireland's interests were served by being part of the deal.\nHowever, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have not yet signed up to the plan. \nThe pact resolves a spat between the US and countries such as the UK and France, which had threatened a digital tax on big mainly American tech firms. \nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: \"As of this morning, virtually the entire global economy has decided to end the race to the bottom on corporate taxation. \n\"Rather than competing on our ability to offer low corporate rates, America will now compete on the skills of our workers and our capacity to innovate, which is a race we can win.\"\nFacebook welcomed the deal, saying it has long called for reform of global tax rules.\n\"We recognise this could mean paying more tax, and in different places,\" said Nick Clegg, its vice president for global affairs. \"The tax system needs to command public confidence, while giving certainty and stability to businesses. We are pleased to see an emerging international consensus.\"\nBut Argentine economy minister Martin Guzman said the proposals would do little to help developing countries. Despite agreeing to the pact, he had argued for a tax rate of at least 21%. \nOxfam also said the 15% rate was too low and would \"let big offenders... off the hook\". The corporate tax rate in industrialised countries averages at 23.5%, well above the agreed 15% floor.\nOxfam's tax policy lead Susana Ruiz said: \"The world is experiencing the largest increase in poverty in decades and a massive explosion in inequality but this deal will do little or nothing to halt either. Instead, it is already being seen by some wealthy nations as an excuse to cut domestic corporate tax rates, risking a new race to the bottom.\""

      "tags": "Press freedom,Rodrigo Duterte,Indonesia,Philippines",
      "text": "Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their fights to defend freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia. \nBoth are known for investigations that have angered their countries' rulers and both have faced threats as a result of this. \nHere, BBC journalists who have worked with the pair share their experiences. \nBy Olga Prosvirova, BBC Russian\nDmitry Muratov is a complex and at times contradictory personality. Over the years of working together, I have seen him bitterly argue with his best correspondents one day, and the next rescue them from an extremely dangerous situation while they were covering a story. \nDmitry's contribution to the development of journalism in Russia cannot be underestimated. He created a unique team of journalists at an organisation that has been considered the main independent media in Russia for some time. \nNovaya Gazeta participated in the Panama Papers investigation, found evidence of the presence of the Russian military in Donbas, and investigated extrajudicial executions in Chechnya. \nJournalists were persecuted, kidnapped, and sometimes killed. \nI have heard journalists from other media organisations ask Dmitry: \"Why haven't you been shut down yet?\" \nTo this he has replied: \"It's not me you have to ask.\" \nDmitry is an editor who knows how to strike a balance for his newspaper - between telling hard-hitting stories and not crossing the line of aggravating Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration. This balance is delicate and hard to maintain, but this skill has allowed his journalists to make a big impact over the years. \nNovaya Gazeta was never a place to earn the big bucks - salaries there have been lower than in many other media outlets on the market. Yet many journalists have remained there for years, and in some cases decades. \nTheir dedication is due to Dmitry's ability to turn the team into a family. I recall people staying late at the office and when we would see each other the following morning we wouldn't say hello, because it felt like we hadn't parted and were sharing a home. \nDmitry was always generating bright and radical ideas. I remember we'd be in the office, each working on a story, and he would dash into the room and say: \"Let's start gathering signatures against the Dima Yakovlev Law (a law that limited the rights of those in the West to adopt children in Russia)!\" We would drop everything and start gathering signatures and testimonies and in the space of a day collect a box of documents to take to the presidential administration to challenge this law.\nHe would always help with any personal problems or issues. If anyone's family member got sick, he'd help find the best doctors or a place at a good hospital. \nAnyone leaving the paper was a painful moment for him. He would treat it as a family member abandoning a home and would struggle to accept it. \nBy Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent\nMaria Ressa has been subjected to a distressing and almost certainly co-ordinated campaign of online abuse, to a pile-on of criminal lawsuits that human rights groups believe amount to state-backed harassment, and the open hostility of the Philippines' Duterte administration. \nThe president's followers have demonised her, as they have other journalists critical of him, as \"presstitutes\". \nHer Nobel Peace Prize puts President Duterte and his officials in a quandary; how do they respond to this, the first Filipino to win the prestigious award?\nWhen Aung San Suu Kyi won the prize in 1991, a similar question might have been asked of the generals who ruled Myanmar. But they were so isolated from the world no-one really expected any response. \nThe Philippines, on the other hand, is a global nation, with large parts of the population living overseas. Its people do care how they are perceived, and will not easily dismiss a Nobel Peace Prize, even if they are not sympathetic to Ms Ressa. \nRecall the awkward spot the government found itself in as recently as July when the country's first ever Olympic gold medal was won by weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, who had also been attacked by Duterte's supporters.\nMaria and I were both based as reporters in Jakarta in 1996 when the Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Ximenes Belo for their campaign against human rights abuses by the Indonesian security forces in East Timor. \nBishop Belo was, in the eyes of the Jakarta government, a citizen of Indonesia, and so, like Maria, the first Nobel prize-winner in his country. \nOn a visit to the occupied territory shortly after the award, President Suharto chose to pretend it had never happened - he shook hands with Bishop Belo but did not mention the prize. But it had a galvanizing effect. Within less than three years Indonesia abandoned East Timor, which became an independent nation, something few thought possible in 1996. \nBoth of us covered the fall of the authoritarian Suharto regime in 1998, Maria for CNN, me for the BBC. The internet was in its infancy then, and the role the media played in publicising the yearning for change felt by many Indonesians could be challenged by the authorities only with the crudest methods - usually simply barring us access to places where events embarrassing to the government had taken place. Those were innocent days indeed, before the advent of organised disinformation on social media.\nMaria's decision to found online news-site Rappler in 2012, when she was already a senior journalist in what was then the top Philippines television station ABS-CBN, was driven by her understanding of the way technology would transform the news business in South East Asia, where changes in the media were lagging behind those seen in Europe and the US. Rappler did not set out to confront the Duterte administration; its reporting of his election victory in 2016 was strikingly even-handed. \nBut it was Maria's recognition - and reporting - of the extraordinarily successful social media manipulation by the Duterte campaign that set her on a collision course with the president. Rappler's bold coverage of the brutal anti-drugs campaign then seemed to put the new media group firmly in the camp of the president's enemies.\nThe Nobel Committee has made some questionable decisions. But it is hard to quibble with the award to Maria Ressa, however uncomfortable it may be for President Duterte. \nNo journalist is perfect, and news reporting can and should be assessed critically, but Maria has stood by the essential principles of good journalism, against an intimidating campaign of abuse. \nThe prize she has just won just might make her life a little easier."

      "text": "The US Senate has voted to temporarily raise the nation's debt limit, avoiding a historic default that experts say would have devastated the economy. \nSenators agreed to increase the limit by $480bn (\u00a3352bn), which will cover the US until early December.\nThe bill was approved in a 50-48 vote, following weeks of partisan fighting.\nThe breakthrough came less than two weeks before the US was set to be unable to borrow money or pay off loans for the first time ever.\nThe bill now has to be approved by the House of Representatives, and will then be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.\nThe vote in the upper house of Congress came after Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell offered his support for a short-term extension.\nSenate Republicans have previously said that raising the debt limit is the \"sole responsibility\" of Democrats because they hold power in the White House and both chambers of Congress.\nThey are frustrated by new spending proposals the Democrats are trying to push through without Republican support, and Mr McConnell tweeted last month that his party would \"not facilitate another reckless, partisan taxing and spending spree\".\nSpeaking after the vote, the Democrats' Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans had \"played a dangerous and risky partisan game\". \n\"What is needed now is a long-term solution so we don't go through this risky drama every few months,\" he added.\nBut several senior Republicans attacked Mr McConnell's decision to strike a deal with Mr Schumer. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham called the move \"a complete capitulation\". \nUS lawmakers will still have to address this issue near the new December deadline to avert a default.\nIf the US defaults on debts, experts say it will severely hurt the country's credit rating, plunge the global financial system into turmoil, and possibly lead to a self-inflicted recession.\nThe US government spends more money than it collects in taxes, so it borrows to make up for the shortfall.\nBorrowing is done via the US Treasury, through the issuing of bonds. US government bonds are seen as among the world's safest and most reliable investments.\nIn 1939, Congress established an aggregate limit or \"ceiling\" on how much debt the government could accumulate.\nThe ceiling has been lifted on more than 100 occasions to allow the government to borrow more. Congress often acts on it in a bipartisan manner and it is rarely the subject of a political standoff.\nBut some Republicans have voiced frustration about new Democrat spending proposals.\nDemocrats have pointed out that raising the debt ceiling is about paying off existing obligations rather than paying for new ones, and that President Biden's policies have only contributed to 3% of existing debts."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Social distancing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The past few months have seen many Covid restrictions eased in Northern Ireland, after a long period of lockdown.\nBut Stormont ministers, who decide what to relax and when, have kept some measures in place.\nBBC News NI explains what rules remain and how Northern Ireland compares to other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\nAs one of the first measures introduced when the pandemic took hold last March, businesses and people have had to rapidly adjust to keeping their distance.\nNow, the legal requirement for social distancing outdoors no longer exists in Northern Ireland.\nIt has been removed for shops, cinemas, theatres and many other indoor settings while social distancing will no longer be required in bars, restaurants and cafes from 31 October. \nThe executive has asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test.\nBut this will be advice and not legally enforceable.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, physical distancing rules remain in place across many sectors but that is due to end by 22 October, under the government's plan to lift almost all remaining restrictions.\nAlthough face coverings are no longer mandatory in many places in England, those rules do not apply in Northern Ireland.\nInstead, people must still wear them on public transport, in shops and a number of other settings - unless they are exempt.\nScotland and Wales have also maintained the rules on face coverings.\nSince July, people going to places of worship in Northern Ireland no longer have to wear a face covering during the service, but it's still the law to wear them when entering and exiting the building.\nHealth officials in Northern Ireland are thought to be in favour of keeping the restrictions on face coverings in place.\nAny decision on their continued use will have to be agreed by the five parties in the Stormont executive, who may take different views.\nNorthern Ireland still has the lowest rate of first dose vaccination in the UK - a factor the executive will have to take into consideration when deciding whether to ease any further restrictions.\nOn Monday 16 August, the rules on self-isolation in Northern Ireland changed.\nClose contacts of those who test positive for Covid no longer have to automatically self-isolate - as long as two weeks have passed since they received their second dose of the vaccine.\nThey are still advised to take an additional PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) Covid test on day two and eight of the process.\nIf the result is positive, they need to self-isolate just like anyone else.\nHospitality had faced some of the toughest restrictions during the pandemic but in recent months those rules have been cut back.\nFor instance, there are no longer limits on the amount of people allowed to sit at a table and table service is no longer mandatory. \nNightclubs will be allowed to reopen from 31 October, a move that has already happened in Great Britain. \nWedding and civil partnership receptions no longer have to operate with limited numbers and dancing and live music is allowed. \nConcerts can take place indoors and, from 14 October, people attending performances at indoor venues will no longer have stay seated.\nRules on the number of people allowed to meet at home still remain in place in Northern Ireland, unlike in England, Scotland or Wales, although they have been eased significantly. \nFrom 14 October, the limit will move from 15 people from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households. \nIn the Republic of Ireland, people who are fully vaccinated can meet together indoors with no limit on numbers. \nPupils in Northern Ireland returned to the classroom in August. \nSchools in Northern Ireland were issued with new guidance from the Public Health Agency (PHA), based on Department of Health (DoH) policy guidance.\nThe new guidance advised that pupils and staff who are identified as close contacts of a positive case, but have no symptoms themselves, do not have to self-isolate if they have recently tested positive for the virus.\nOther close contacts, who have not received a positive test within the previous 90 days, do have to self-isolate, but they can reduce their 10-day period of self-isolation if they have a negative PCR test result.\nHowever, there have been concerns over the number of children missing class, with more than half of pupils at one school being sent home as close contacts. \nPreviously, ministers had agreed that the system of \"bubbles\", where children only mix within a fixed year or class group will be removed.\nHowever they decided to retain face coverings for post-primary students in classrooms for the first six weeks of term, subject to a review.\nIn Scotland, pupils and teachers in secondary schools will continue to wear face coverings and the 1m social distancing rule will remain for at least the first six weeks of term. \nPeople in England are no longer being asked to work from home, but in Northern Ireland advice remains to work from home where possible.\nSimilar advice remains in place in Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland.\nStormont ministers discussed the issue in August but it is understood health officials advised keeping the guidance in place. \nIn recent months, Stormont ministers have continued to urge employers to be flexible, and adhere to public health advice as much as possible.\nAfter ministers agreed to remove social distancing in indoor venues such as theatres and shops, ministers asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test.\nBut this will be advice and not legally enforceable.\nHowever, it is understood that Department of Health Department of Health will now progress work to develop a digital vaccine passport scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it.\nIt is thought the scheme could be ready by November.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she did not to have to enact a mandatory scheme, and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, proof of vaccination is now required in order to enter pubs and restaurants.\nIn Northern Ireland, a number of music and sporting events have already said people must prove they have had both vaccines, or provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test up to 48 hours before the event, in order to gain entry.\nWhen it comes to travelling abroad, at present people in Northern Ireland can also apply for vaccine certification from the Department of Health.

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

He was jailed, but before he went to prison he managed to kill Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth, and once released he killed Jack Taylor.\nFollowing a trial at the Old Bailey in 2016, Port was found guilty of all four murders and sentenced to a whole-life term.\nThe inquest at Barking Town Hall is examining whether police mistakes cost the lives of some of the victims by failing to stop Port sooner.

      "text": "A US nuclear submarine hit an \"unknown object\" while submerged in waters in the Asia-Pacific region, injuring a number of sailors, US officials say.\nIt was not clear what caused the incident on Saturday, they said. The submarine remained \"fully operational\".\nUnnamed officials told US media the collision happened in international waters in the South China Sea, and that 11 sailors had been injured.\nThe incident happened amid rising tensions in the region.\nThe US Navy said the extent of the damage was still being assessed and that the submarine's nuclear propulsion plant and spaces had not been affected.\nThe statement did not give details about where the incident took place or the number of people hurt, saying only that the injuries were not \"life threatening\".\nBut two officials quoted by the Associated Press said two of the 11 sailors that were hurt had injuries that were classified as \"moderate\". All of them were treated on board the submarine.\nThose officials said the incident took place while the submarine was conducting routine operations and that the Navy did not make the news public before Thursday in order to maintain operational security. \nAccording to AP, the officials said the object the USS Connecticut collided with was not another submarine. One of the officials quoted by the agency said it could have been a sunken vessel or container, or other uncharted object.\nAlexander Neill, a Singapore-based defence and security expert, told the BBC the number of injuries caused by the collision suggested the submarine probably \"hit something big\" and was \"going really fast\".\nThe incident, he said, was \"uncommon but not unheard of\" and had exposed how busy the area was with military activities. \n\"The South China Sea has been increasingly saturated with naval vessels from a number of different countries. While there's been a lot of show of force by surface vessels you don't see the level of activity under the surface,\" Mr Neill said. \nIn comments reported by Chinese state-run daily Global Times, a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs said China was \"seriously concerned\" about the incident, calling on the US to provide further details, including the purpose of the mission. \nThe submarine was later reported to be heading towards the US territory of Guam.\nUSNI News, a site specialised in the US Navy, said the last known incident where a submerged US submarine struck another underwater object was in 2005, when the USS San Francisco hit an underwater mountain at full speed near Guam. One sailor died in the incident.\nThe USS Connecticut was operating in one of the most contested regions in the world. China claims most of the South China Sea, but surrounding countries and the US disagree.\nThe Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam have all been disputing China's claim to almost all of the Sea for decades but tension steadily increased in recent years.\nThe US has backed many of these countries in this territorial dispute.\nThe incident comes just weeks after the US, UK and Australia agreed a historic security pact in the Asia-Pacific, in what's seen as an effort to counter China.  \nMeanwhile, the US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, told the BBC he was \"deeply concerned\" about actions that undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan and China.\nHe was speaking after China sent a record number of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for the fourth day running.

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,UK economy,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "Households will again see \"significant rises\" in energy prices next spring, regulator Ofgem has warned.\nIts chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, would go up again because of the \"unprecedented\" rise in gas prices.\nThe cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April.\nNatural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. \nAs a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it.\nLast month, nine of those companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers.\nOfgem's Mr Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but \"legitimate costs have to be passed through\".\nHe said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future.\nHowever, he added that the regulator might have to look at the formula according to which the cap was set.\nHis warning comes as domestic customers are still reeling from the latest price cap increase, which took effect for households in England, Scotland and Wales this month.\nHouseholds in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.\nThe energy crisis falls into three broad stages for UK consumers and businesses.\nFirstly, the here and now. Domestic customers have seen a rise in direct debit demands and bills from suppliers. They are, however, protected from the extreme cost of gas on the wholesale markets by the price cap. Businesses are not. Many are seeing instant and large increases in their energy bills.\nSecondly, as Ofgem confirms, significantly higher energy prices in the spring are inevitable, potentially adding hundreds of pounds to an annual household bill. That is something which customers can do nothing to stop.\nThirdly, a review by the regulator will consider the extent to which the price cap protects customers versus the extra burden it places on all bill payers picking up the cost if the cap causes suppliers to fold.\nAt any point in this process, the government can step in. Thus far, it has shown little appetite to do so. \nWhen the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills.\nThat was the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThe next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February, but will come into force in April.\nEven if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable.\nAnalysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by \u00a3400, meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay about \u00a31,660 a year.\nOn Thursday, National Energy Action, a charity, said that between 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households could be hit by fuel poverty next year.\nMeanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold talks later on Friday with representatives of industries which have the heaviest energy consumption, such as steel, cement and chemicals.  \nWhile the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices.\nThey have called for government help to control costs and keep plants open.  \nThe UK has lower levels of gas stored than many other European countries, making it more exposed to global price volatility.\nMr Kwarteng said on Twitter protecting consumers from rising global gas prices was \"his top priority\".\nHis meeting with the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) will include representative bodies UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, the Confederation of Paper Industries, the Mineral Products Association, the British Glass Manufacturers Federation, the British Ceramic Confederation, BOC, Air Products and the Major Energy Users Council.\nAhead of the meeting, the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, told the BBC that the government needed to step in to help industries cope with the rising cost of energy.\n\"If the government does nothing, then tomorrow there'll be a steel crisis, and in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel, is but for the UK economy as a whole,\" he added.\nLast month, high gas prices forced two fertiliser factories to close, cutting supplies of carbon dioxide which is widely used in food production."

      "text": "The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed.\nNightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped.\nRestrictions will be lifted from 31 October.\nA number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. \nMinisters have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings.\nIt is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. \nThe industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade.\nThe new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up.\nChanges were also announced to the UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countries to seven.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic.\n\"I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,\" he said.\nMr Givan said the sector benefitted from \"a high level of adherence\" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. \n\"We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,\" she said. \nMs O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a \"crucially important\" part of the executive's winter planning.\nUnder existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland.\nFrom Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households.\nFrom that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance.\nThe executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. \nNightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. \nIt's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. \nBut not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. \nThe executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed.\nJohn Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector \"had been waiting on for some time\".\nHe said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival.\n\"It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,\" he said. \n\"We can get back to a bit more normality.\"\nJanice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented \"significant challenges\" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again.\nShe said: \"The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. \n\"Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim.\"\nIn September, the executive agreed to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. \nThey asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test.\nBut this is advice and is not legally enforceable.\nLast week, Health Minister Robin Swann warned that a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it.\nMs O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. \nMinisters also discussed a bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey for \u00a355m in funding to mitigate the end of a \u00a320 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. \nStormont received an extra \u00a3180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed.\nThe expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending.\nMr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments \nMr Givan said the Executive had to be \"honest\" with the public about the financial position.\n\"Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,\" he said.\n\"That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London.\n\"So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.\""

It was so scary.\"\nStill unaware of how serious her condition was, Julie went home where she continued working as a data privacy officer for drinks giant Diageo. \n\"I was in a Zoom meeting the following day when my phone wouldn't stop ringing, so eventually I thought I had better answer it,\" she says.\n\"It was my doctor and she was saying I had to report immediately to the medical centre.\"\nJulie was then sent to hospital as staff said she was turning more yellow by the minute.\nShe had an ultrasound and a CT scan, which found a blockage in her bile duct.\n\"They said you have a tumour, it's probably cancer and where it is we have to operate,\" Julie says.\nJulie says: \"They told me it was a dangerous whipple operation and of the death rate on the operating table.\n\"My dad was with me, as I hadn't wanted to bother my husband at work, and he went pure white.\"\nHalf of her pancreas, the gall bladder and bile duct and some of her small intestine were removed.\nShe lost two-and-a-half stones in weight and was in hospital, including intensive care, for a month.\nHer daughter had given birth to her first grandchild, Havanah May, so she wanted to convalesce at home.\nJulie says her husband saved her life by noticing she was turning yellow.\nKeith, a forklift driver, said: \"When I noticed Julie's eyes were going awful yellow I immediately put it down to the hours she works and told her she must be dehydrated.\n\"She's working when I go to work and is still working when I return from my shift.\n\"But the next day she was even yellower, despite drinking water, and her skin was a golden colour. We didn't know what it was, it was weird what was happening to her.\n\"You hear of things like this happening to other people but you never think it's going to happen in your own household.\"\nJulie started turning yellow in March 2020. She had an operation and then several rounds of chemotherapy and could not walk without a Zimmer frame. Her husband had to wash her and took three months off work to care for her.\nSince then, Julie has undergone intervention for serious wounds after her operation.\nShe only started recovering back to full strength in the summer 2021.\nIn August, she completed a 134-mile (216km) walk of the whole John Muir Way from Helensburgh on the west coast of Scotland to Dunbar on the east coast.\nBut although she had reached full strength, she still had a lot of anxiety about what had happened.\n\"That's when I visited Maggie's Centre and they have been helping me so much. I can speak to them about everything and they don't take notes,\" Julie says.\nShe will continue to be regularly monitored at the hospital.\nLesley Howells, lead psychologist for Maggie's centre, said: \"Regardless of prognosis, life post-treatment can be hugely challenging.\n\"Friends and family might be clapping their hands and saying 'great, normal service resumed', but for the person who has been through the treatment they might feel as if their life has been turned upside down and shaken around.\"\nJulie's husband Keith says: \"It was very lucky Julie changed colour or we would never have known something was wrong as she didn't feel any different.

      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Bulb",
      "text": "Together Energy is the latest UK supplier to collapse due to rising gas prices. \nTwenty-eight energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. \nMore than three million customers have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. \nOfgem said a new supplier will be found for Together Energy's 176,000 domestic customers, whose supply will continue without interruption. \nThe other companies which have already gone out of business are: \nAmpoweruk Ltd, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy Limited, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice, Goto, Green, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy Limited, Money Plus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy Limited, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Utility Point, Zebra Power Limited and Zog Energy.  \nFirms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

      "text": "Recently sacked Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has urged the prime minister not to water down planning reforms to enable more house building.\nSources have told the BBC the changes - which would help meet a pledge to build 300,000 new homes - are being paused amid a backlash among Conservative MPs.\nMr Jenrick's successor Michael Gove is said to want to address the concerns. \nBut Mr Jenrick told the BBC's Newscast a government with a big majority must tackle difficult issues. \nThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it remained \"committed\" to meeting its housing targets.\nIn his Conservative Party conference speech on Wednesday, Boris Johnson promised to end declining property ownership among young people by constructing more houses in England.\nThe government has pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year. To achieve that, a blueprint published last summer said the current regime - where local planning officials assess applications case-by-case - should replaced with new rules based on zones.\nCouncils would have to classify all land in their area as \"protected\", for \"renewal\", or for \"growth\", which ministers argued would speed up developments.\nIn addition, each council would have to plan for a share of homes from the government's annual house building target for England.\nSeveral Conservative MPs, concerned about the size and nature of potential developments in their constituencies, have spoken out against the plans, which are also opposed by Labour. \nIn June, the Conservatives lost the previously safe seat of Chesham and Amersham to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election, in part due to concerns over more house building in the area. \nIn September, government sources told the BBC they were pausing the reforms, following the cabinet reshuffle in which Mr Jenrick was sacked.\nBut Mr Jenrick told Newscast ministers should not \"bottle\" making the changes.\n\"Housing is one of those areas where you can make a huge difference, helping people onto the housing ladder, reducing the cost of living, increasing productivity, helping small businesses,\" Mr Jenrick said.\n\"It cuts across all of the government's priorities, so I strongly, strongly urge the prime minister to stick with it.\"\nMr Jenrick also said a government with an 80-strong majority in the House of Commons was in an \"incredibly fortunate\" position and should be trying to tackle difficult questions.\nA Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: \"We remain committed to continuing our progress towards our target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.\n\"We are currently reviewing departmental programmes and we will come forward with our proposals for reform of the planning system in due course.\""

      "tags": "Agriculture,Climate change,Food,Sustainable agriculture",
      "text": "Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade, a study has shown.\nThat reduction though is not happening quickly enough to meet a key national target, according to scientists. \nThe aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our diets.\nThis goal, set by the National Food Strategy, is based on a review of the whole UK food system - from farming and production to hunger and sustainability. \nIt recommends meat consumption in the UK fall by 30% over the next 10 years.\n\"We now know we need a more substantial reduction,\" said lead researcher Cristina Stewart from the University of Oxford. \nThe new study, published in the journal the Lancet Planetary Health, revealed that while most people are eating less red and processed meat compared to a decade ago, they are eating more white meat. \nHigh consumption of red and processed meat can increase the risk of health problems including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even certain cancers. \nMeat production also has a higher environmental impact - producing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - than other types of agriculture and food production. \nThis Oxford-based research team used data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey - a detailed survey of the dietary habits of more than 15,000 people across the country.  \nThis showed that daily meat consumption had reduced by about 17g per person per day. \nWhat it did not reveal was the reason people were changing their diets. But market research in 2019 suggested that almost 40% of meat-eaters were actively trying to reduce their consumption, with many citing either health or environmental reasons. \nDr Stewart stresses that, for those who want to reduce the environmental impact of what they eat, \"any reduction in meat will have an impact\". \n\"You don't have to be vegetarian,\" she said. \"Although, in general, meat-free dishes will have a lower impact. \n\"But if you're someone that eats meat every day, reducing your meat consumption by 30% just looks like having two meat-free days per week.\" \nThere is huge variation in the environmental impact of meat; it depends on what livestock are fed and where and how the meat is produced. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\n\"Locally produced meat has a much lower impact than meat that has been imported,\" Dr Stewart pointed out.  \nShe and her colleagues have also been studying the effect of \"environmental impact labelling\" on consumer choices. They have designed experimental labels that score a product based on its greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, water-use and water pollution. \n\"When you don't have the information about environmental impact of food, it's really hard to shop with that in mind,\" she pointed out. \nHaving the support of those we eat our meals with, the Oxford researchers say, makes it easier for us to change our diets. And the availability and prominence of meat-free food options has an effect on people's food choices, too. \n\"So, for example, if you're at a restaurant, you often see a vegetarian options 'box of shame' at the bottom of the menu rather than at the top with chef's specials,\" Dr Stewart explained.\nThe team's ongoing study of what drives people to reduce their meat consumption has revealed some simple strategies that participants have found helpful, including: \n\"Hopefully this paper will help us understand the patterns and trends so we can tailor public health policies and behavioural nudges to help people choose more sustainable options,\" said Dr Stewart. \nHear Idris and Sabrina Elba discuss the impact on the planet of what we eat on the What Planet Are We On podcast on BBC Sounds\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

In Austin our factory is like five minutes from the airport, 15 minutes from downtown,\" he said.\nThe billionaire technology entrepreneur has had an fractious relationship at times with California.\nIn May, Musk had a high profile spat with local politicians in California after he was ordered to keep Tesla's Fremont plant closed. \nHe tweeted: \"Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately.\" However the move had not been confirmed until now. \nDespite moving its headquarters, Mr Musk also said that the company planned to increase output from its California and Nevada factories by 50%. \n\"This is not a matter of, sort of, Tesla leaving California,\" he said. \nTesla is not the first company to move to Texas. In 2020, tech powerhouse Oracle announced it was moving from Silicon Valley to Austin.\nTechnology firm HP and carmaker Toyota have also moved their US headquarters to Texas from California.\nCalifornia has stronger labour laws, and higher living costs and taxes than other states, while Texas is known for cheaper labour and less stringent regulation.\nMr Musk moved his home to Texas from California at the end of last year to focus on Tesla's new car manufacturing plant there.\nHis SpaceX rocket company has a launch site in the southern tip of Texas."

      "text": "Christmas this year is likely to be more normal than in 2020, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said.\nHe said if nothing unexpected happens Wales can look forward to a holiday season \"much more like the ones we are used to\".\nThe Welsh government said that all businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter.\nBut it has drawn up a \"Covid Urgent\" plan if a new variant risks overwhelming the NHS. \nIn a statement setting out Wales' autumn and winter plan, the government said such a scenario could be the emergence of a new, fast-spreading variant or if vaccine immunity levels fall, causing a rise in pandemic pressures.\nBut it is more likely the country will slowly move out of the pandemic, where coronavirus becomes a seasonal illness, and that businesses can stay open.\nMr Drakeford said Wales remains at alert level zero, with no changes likely in the next three weeks beyond those already announced.\nAt a briefing on Friday he also said it would now be easier to visit a loved one in a care home.\nIt comes as Wales' case rates dip below 500 per 100,000 for the first time since mid-September.\nMr Drakeford said in the most probable scenario \"we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level we have at the moment.\n\"That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmasses we were used to.\"\n\"If nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to.\"\nWales went into lockdown days before Christmas last year, curtailing plans to allow more mixing over the period.\nBusinesses said the news they would probably not be facing another winter lockdown was \"reassuring\".\nNeil Collier, owner of Colliers Photo Imaging in Uplands, Swansea, said he faced \"quite a hit\" last Christmas with \"panicked customers wondering if they were going to get their orders\". \n\"I think it's more security for business trade going into the winter months which is potentially our busiest period,\" he added.\nLast winter, Nicki Collier, who manages Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tycoch, also Swansea, faced having to cancel bookings and process refunds.\n\"It's really reassuring to hear some good news finally. Shutting overnight last year was a really big shock,\" she said.\n\"Fingers crossed now this is good news for this Christmas.\"\nDr Richard Stanton, a virologist at Cardiff University, said the Welsh government should stick with current restrictions to \"keep a lid on transmission rates\" ahead of the winter.\nHe said Covid-19 was now not the only concern, with other respiratory viruses such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common winter bug that can cause lung problems - likely to spread too.\n\"All those things will put pressure on the NHS and could result in further hospitalisations,\" he added.p\nMr Drakeford confirmed there would be no changes to the current regulations for the next three weeks, beyond those already announced.\nRules around care home visits will be reduced, however. Mr Drakeford said providers can now allow visitors to take lateral flow tests at home and will no longer have to socially distance in a resident's room or in a designated visiting room.\nRestrictions around gifts, including food and drink, will also be eased.\nThe first minister set out two planning scenarios for the pandemic over the winter.\nIn the first, called Covid Stable, Wales remains at alert level zero through the autumn and winter, with all businesses able to open.\nThe second, Covid Urgent, is designed to deal with any sudden changes to the situation.\nIf that happens previously drawn up \"alert levels\" - including lockdown at level four - could be used as an option of last resort.\n\"While we do not think measures under a Covid Urgent scenario will be necessary this autumn or winter, we cannot completely rule them out,\" the plan added.\nMr Drakeford told journalists that, should demand for PCR tests outstrip the ability to provide them during the winter, then some less-vulnerable groups would be offered lateral flow strips in the first instance.\nHe told journalists there was no plan to charge for PCR tests, but said after the winter Wales will begin to move into an era where \"mass testing will play a less important part in the way we manage the virus\".\n\"We will be reserving the tests for the purposes for which they are most important\", he added.\nPrior to the press conference the first minister said Wales was \"facing a challenging winter ahead - coronavirus hasn't gone away and flu is forecast to return this winter.\"\n\"Vaccination is the best defence we have against coronavirus - the more people who are fully vaccinated, the better our chances of controlling the spread of this awful virus.\"\nHe encouraged everyone who was eligible \"to have their flu jab this year\".\nHe said he believed Wales was now past the peak of the third wave, following a decline in cases over the last few days.\nIn other measures to keep Wales safe, Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introduced from Monday, following a narrow victory for the Welsh government in a knife-edge Senedd vote this week.\nThe public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test.\nMr Drakeford told the BBC's Dros Frecwast programme event organisers were responsible for checking people were carrying the correct Covid passes through a spot check system, as fines were being introduced for fake ones from Monday.\n\"When there are lots and lots of people trying to go in, for example, there will be no need to check each one,\" he said.\nAt the briefing, he said he expected the introduction of Covid passes would be \"relatively smooth,\" but admitted it would not be without \"teething trouble\".\n\"I think that the system is easy to use,\" he added.\nProfessor of epidemiology and biostatistics Mike Gravenor, of Swansea University Medical School, has been part of the team looking at the modelling of Covid-19 in Wales.\nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"We're still under a situation of uncertainty. A new variant is one factor and our understanding of how long immunity lasts for, in natural immunity and in vaccinated individuals.\"\nAll the indicators are pointing to an improving position with regards to Covid - case rates have been falling for the last nine days.\nThe spike we saw in recent weeks was driven by high numbers of under-19s, especially secondary school-age children, testing positive, ahead of vaccinations being available for this age group.\nThe character of this third wave spike was also influenced by record numbers of lateral flow tests coming back positive, so young people were being found to have Covid, even if not displaying symptoms.\nBecause so many infections have involved young people, while many older and vulnerable people have been double-vaccinated, we have not seen anything like the Covid cases in hospital beds. \nAdmissions have been higher in recent weeks than some early modelling predicted as likely, but numbers of patients with Covid are coming down. \nOn Wednesday, there were 14% fewer Covid patients in hospital beds on average than two weeks ago. \nWe have been seeing similar numbers in critical care for more than a month and those in ICU with non-Covid conditions outnumber Covid patients by more than two to one. \nBut hospital managers will still be concerned that there are more than 420 Covid patients in beds across Wales and bed occupancy is at 90% in acute hospitals, with the winter to come.\nSadly, there are still people dying of Covid and figures from the ONS this week showed 88 deaths in Wales in the latest week. But numbers are down considerably on earlier waves - and after a spike in September, they are back within the range expected by scientists."

      "tags": "Exercise,Life",
      "text": "Doctors are being warned about a dangerous pre-workout trend called dry scooping that some gym-goers are doing. \nIt involves eating powder supplements neat, rather than diluting them in water, as recommended by manufacturers, to make a drink. \nResearchers, who are giving a talk at a US medical conference, are worried young teens may try it, spurred on by a flurry of internet videos of the fad. \nThey scanned TikTok, counting the millions of likes. \nPre-workout powders typically contain lots of amino acids, vitamins and other ingredients, such as caffeine. \nThe idea is to give the body a boost before a workout to help stamina, although the science around it is patchy.\nBut there are known risks from taking on too many energy-boosting stimulants. \nA big dose of caffeine, for example, can cause heart-related side effects, including palpitations and extra or missed beats. \nA scoop of powder might pack as much caffeine as five cups of coffee, say the researchers from the Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York. \nThis jolt can cause \"an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, potentially leading to disturbances in heart rhythm\".\nAnd accidentally inhaling the powder into the lungs could cause choking or an infection or pneumonia, say the researchers.\nIn the UK, the products are regulated as foods rather than medicines, but must be deemed safe for consumption to be able to be sold in shops to people 18 and over.\nSome powders sold online may not be from reputable suppliers or contain the ingredients listed on the pack. \nSeveral have since been banned for containing substances such as a synthetic amphetamine called DMAA and a stimulant called synephrine.\nRecent newspaper articles have also highlighted the dangers after a 20-year-old social media influencer from the US, called Briatney Portillo, posted about purportedly having a heart attack that she links to dry scooping.\nThe study researchers analysed 100 videos posted on the TikTok social network channel, using the hashtag \"preworkout\" for their search. \nOnly eight of them showed the powder being used in the correct way.\nMore than 30 featured dry scooping, with individuals putting a scoop of undiluted powder into their mouth followed by a few sips of water or liquid. \nThese amassed more than eight million likes. \nThe researchers warn in their presentation for the American Academy of Pediatrics meeting: \"Physicians should be aware of the pervasiveness of pre-workout, dangerous methods of consumption, and the potential for accidental over-consumption, inhalation, and injury.\"\nNutrition scientist Bridget Benelam, from the British Nutrition Foundation, said: \"Pre-workout powders typically contain caffeine along with other ingredients such as creatine, amino acids and vitamins. \n\"There doesn't appear to be much research on the benefits of these products, although there is some evidence that caffeine may improve sports performance in some cases. These studies are typically done in athletes, and so it's not clear how relevant this is for the wider population. \n\"The levels of caffeine in these products vary from the equivalent of about one to over three cups of filter coffee, if made up according to the manufacturer's instructions. \n\"So, there is a risk of over-consuming caffeine, especially if using more than once a day, or just consuming the powder, where you may consume more than the recommended amount.\"\nKeeping hydrated by having enough water or fluid as you exercise is also important. \nThe British Heart Foundation advises: "

      "text": "The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed.\nNightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped.\nRestrictions will be lifted from 31 October.\nA number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. \nMinisters have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings.\nIt is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. \nThe industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade.\nThe new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up.\nChanges were also announced to the UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countries to seven.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic.\n\"I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,\" he said.\nMr Givan said the sector benefitted from \"a high level of adherence\" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. \n\"We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,\" she said. \nMs O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a \"crucially important\" part of the executive's winter planning.\nUnder existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland.\nFrom Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households.\nFrom that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance.\nThe executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. \nNightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. \nIt's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. \nBut not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. \nThe executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed.\nJohn Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector \"had been waiting on for some time\".\nHe said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival.\n\"It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,\" he said. \n\"We can get back to a bit more normality.\"\nJanice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented \"significant challenges\" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again.\nShe said: \"The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. \n\"Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim.\"\nIn September, the executive agreed to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. \nThey asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test.\nBut this is advice and is not legally enforceable.\nLast week, Health Minister Robin Swann warned that a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it.\nMs O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. \nMinisters also discussed a bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey for \u00a355m in funding to mitigate the end of a \u00a320 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. \nStormont received an extra \u00a3180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed.\nThe expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending.\nMr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments \nMr Givan said the Executive had to be \"honest\" with the public about the financial position.\n\"Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,\" he said.\n\"That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London.\n\"So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.\""

      "text": "A micro artist's tiny versions of six famous works of art have sold for more than \u00a390,000. \nDavid A Lindon has recreated Munch's The Scream, Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, Monet's Water Lily, Banksy's Girl With Balloon, and van Gogh's The Starry Night and Sunflowers.\nHis versions are small enough to fit into the eye of a needle.\nThe Bournemouth sculptor, who began his hobby in 2018, called it a \"life-changing amount\". \nThey have all been sold to private collectors for \u00a315,000 each, prior to his first exhibition.  \nMr Lindon only recently turned professional having previously worked in engineering.\nHe was first inspired by watching a TV programme about micro artist Willard Wigan, whose work he found \"astonishing\".\nShortly after he \"woke up in the middle of the night\" newly determined to join the profession himself.\nIn response, Mr Wigan has called Mr Lindon's work \"very good\".\nHe added: \"The best micro artists in the world are from the UK. You have me, Graham Short, and David A Lindon.\"\nMr Lindon worked hard to perfect his new skill, and his interpretations of famous musicians, including Freddie Mercury and Amy Winehouse, soon began attracting attention.\nHe told the BBC he recently diversified into recreating famous masterpieces to further challenge himself.\n\"It seemed a natural progression to explore paintings and to discover just how small I can go,\" he said.\n\"Whilst creating a micro painting uses the same process as doing a full size art piece, there is a greater focus on transposing the aesthetic qualities of the original whilst representing them on a much smaller scale.\"\nMr Lindon works in an \"almost emotionless trance\" during the night to avoid distractions and unwanted noise, and spends more than a month on each 0.5mm-wide [0.02in] plastic piece.\nBut he professes to not enjoy agonising over the intricate artworks, which he describes as a \"physical challenge and a mental battle\".\n\"I have to slow my heartbeat down essentially,\" he explained, adding: \"I control my nerves, I steady myself. I get lost in my own world, I really do.\"\nHe added: \"The only thing I enjoy is when it's done. That relief, and then to see the expressions of joy and surprise on people's faces, is fantastic.\"\nThe six masterpieces and a further six pieces of art can been seen at A New Beginning, an exhibition at the Lighthouse Media Centre in Wolverhampton, until 29 October. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity.\nEnergy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas.\nNational Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty.\nHouseholds that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty.\nAt the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account.\nBut Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up.\nAnalysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between \u00a3400 and \u00a3600 more per year. \nHouseholds in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.\nIf you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company.\nNormally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now.\nUntil recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available.\nThe cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase.\nSo for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nNational Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty.\n\"It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by \u00a3400 to \u00a3600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,\" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer.\nNEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households.\nOfgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April. \nIts chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was \"designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time\".\nNatural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. \nAs a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it.\nEven with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties.\n\"Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,\" he told an energy conference on Thursday.\nNine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers.\nThose households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy.\nThe government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he said.\nDecarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said. \n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nHowever, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term.\nThe next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April.\nAnalysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by \u00a3400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around \u00a31,660 a year.\nHowever the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nBusinesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead to higher prices for their goods as increases are passed on to consumers.\nRichard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now \"inevitable\".\n\"The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases.\"\nMark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture. \nThe past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about \u00a3500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand.\n\"It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,\" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster. \n\"Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was \u00a38,000 - it was a shock.\n\"We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down.\" \nThe energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas.\nWhen the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThat is a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by \u00a384, to \u00a31,042.\nWill you be affected by rising energy prices?

Another 36,060 positive tests were recorded.\nFrom today, the advice against \"all but essential travel\" will be lifted for: the Bahamas, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Jamaica, Martinique, Palau, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Western Sahara.\nFrom Monday, the same advice will be lifted for: Angola, Argentina, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Cape Verde, Chile, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Georgia, Guyana, Indonesia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Paraguay, Philippines, Reunion, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Zambia, and Zimbabwe."

      "text": "The gap between private-school fees and state-school per-pupil spending in England has more than doubled over the past decade, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.\nAverage fees, of \u00a313,600, were more than 90% higher than the \u00a37,100 spent on state-school pupils in 2020-21, compared with a gap of 39% in 2009-10. \nFor sixth-formers, fees are about three times higher than per-student funding.\nThe government says schools are having the biggest funding uplift in a decade. \nWhile private-school fees have grown by more than 20% above inflation since 2009-10, state-school per-pupil spending has fallen by 9% in real terms. \nAnd the gap in resource levels is probably even larger, the IFS researchers say, as the figures do not include other forms of income for private schools, such as account investment and endowments or gifts. \n\"Longstanding concerns about inequalities between private- and state-school pupils, which have come into sharp focus during the pandemic, will not begin to be easily addressed while the sectors enjoy such different levels of resourcing,\" Luke Sibieta said.\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: \"School budgets have been hammered over the last decade, which is holding children back. \n\"As state-school class sizes have soared and enriching activities - art, sport, music, drama - have been cut back, the gap with private schools has grown ever wider.\"\nAssociation of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said: \"It is pretty outrageous that the government has cut funding in real terms to schools and colleges over the past decade, while independent school fees have increased over the same period. \n\"The funding gap between the two sectors has always been there of course but the fact it has widened to such a huge extent does stick in the throat. \n\"Surely the government should want the same opportunities for all children and young people. \n\"It may be naive to think that state education funding could match the independent sector but it surely shouldn't actually go into reverse.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"This government is providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade - \u00a314bn in total over the three years to 2022-23. \n\"This includes a \u00a37.1bn increase in funding for schools by 2022-23, compared to 2019-20 funding levels.\n\"Next year, funding through the schools national funding formula (NFF) is increasing by 2.8% per pupil compared to 2021-22. \n\"The NFF continues to distribute this fairly, based on the needs of schools and their pupil cohorts.\""

      "tags": "Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest,Amazon rainforest,Climate change,Facebook",
      "text": "Facebook says it will begin clamping down on the illegal sale of protected areas of the Amazon rainforest on its site.  \nThe social media giant changed its policy following a BBC investigation into the practice.\nThe new measures will apply only to conservation areas and not to publicly owned forest.\nAnd the move will be limited to the Amazon, not other rainforests and wildlife habitats across the world.\nAccording to a recent study from the think tank Ipam (Instituto de Pesquisa Ambental da Amazonia), a third of all deforestation happens in publicly-owned forests in the Amazon.\nFacebook said it would not reveal how it planned to find the illegal ads but said it would \"seek to identify and block new listings\" in protected areas of the Amazon rainforest.  \nIn February, the BBC Our World documentary Selling the Amazon revealed that plots of rainforest as large as 1,000 football pitches were being listed on Facebook's classified ads service. \nMany of the plots were inside protected areas, including national forests and land reserved for indigenous peoples. \nIn order to prove the ads were real, the BBC arranged meetings between four sellers and an undercover operative posing as a lawyer claiming to represent wealthy investors. \nOne land-grabber, Alvim Souza Alves, was trying to sell a plot inside the Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous reserve for about \u00a316,400 in local currency. \nIn response to the BBC's investigation, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court ordered an inquiry into the sale of protected areas of the Amazon via Facebook. \nDespite calls from indigenous leaders to do more, at the time Facebook said it was \"ready to work with local authorities\", but would not take independent action to halt the trade. \nNow the company says it has consulted the UN Environment Programme (Unep) and other organisations to take its \"first steps\" in trying to address the issue.  \n\"We will now review listings on Facebook Marketplace against an international organisation's authoritative database of protected areas to identify listings that may violate this new policy,\" the Californian tech firm clarified. \nThe announcement comes at a time when the social media giant is under increasing pressure from US lawmakers, following a series of bombshell leaks by whistle-blower and former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen. \nFacebook also faced criticism this week when a failure brought down the entire platform for five hours worldwide. Instagram and Whatsapp, both owned by Facebook, were also offline during the period. \nTo try to catch criminal sellers, Facebook is using a database managed by the Unep World Conservation Monitoring Centre. \nUnep says it is the most \"comprehensive\" database of its kind and is updated monthly using reports from \"a range of government and other institutions\". \nBut Brazilian lawyer and scientist Brenda Brito questions the effectiveness of Facebook's proposals, saying: \"If they don't make it mandatory for sellers to provide the location of the area on sale, any attempt at blocking them will be flawed. \n\"They may have the best database in the world, but if they don't have some geo-location reference, it won't work,\" she added.   \nIn its investigation, the BBC found some ads featured satellite images and GPS co-ordinates but not all shared that level of information. \nFacebook told the BBC it did not intend to require sellers to post the precise location of advertised land.  \n\"We know there are no 'silver bullets' in this topic and we will continue to work to prevent people from circumventing our inspection,\" a company spokesperson said.  \nThe Amazon rainforest occupies 7.5 million sq km and spans more than seven countries, including Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.  \nThe tech firm would not confirm whether it was also working with each region's respective government to strengthen enforcement.  \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nAbout 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil where deforestation rates are at a 12-year high. \nThe Brazilian government's public forest database, which would be a key tool for any attempt to control the majority of illegal sales online, isn't being used. \n\"This data has been available since 2016. It is information they could use to improve this effort,\" says Brenda Brito. \nHowever, environmental activists in Brazil are calling the Facebook announcement a small victory against a backdrop of massive deforestation in the Amazon and several congressional attempts to weaken protection laws. \nIvaneide Bandeira, whose NGO Kandide was among those calling for Facebook to do more when the BBC's investigation came out in February, says she is pleased.  \n\"I think this announcement is a good thing. Although it's coming late, because they should never have allowed those ads.\n\"But the fact that they are now taking this position is good because it will help to protect the territory, as it will help not to publicise the sale of land inside a protected area or an indigenous land.\" \nRead more about the BBC's investigation here. \nWatch Our World: Selling the Amazon on BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "The US is \"deeply concerned\" about actions that undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan has told the BBC. \nHis comments come after China sent a \"record number\" of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for four days in a row, in a public show of force.\nTaiwan considers itself a sovereign state - but China views the island as a breakaway province. \nBeijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification.\n\"We are going to stand up and speak out, both privately and publicly when we see the kinds of activities that are fundamentally destabilising,\" Mr Sullivan told the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale in Brussels on Thursday, a day after meeting China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi.\nAsked whether the US was prepared to take military action to defend Taiwan, Mr Sullivan said: \"Let me just say this, we are going to take action now to try to prevent that day from ever coming to pass.\"\nPressed on whether the US was reluctant to use force in the wake of its recent withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mr Sullivan said it was \"an enormous mistake to try to draw lessons\" from that conflict.\n\"Trying to say that coming out of Afghanistan somehow tells any country anything about the depth and level of commitment the US has elsewhere is a grave mistake.\"\nMr Sullivan said China was \"going to steadfastly defend its perspective on the world\".\nAnd he added: \"It's incumbent upon us as the United States, working with allies and partners to make clear where we stand, to stand up for our friends, to stand up for our interests... And that's what we intend to do.\"\nTaiwan broke away from the mainland as communists seized power in 1949. \nAnalysts have warned that Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and wants to deter its President Tsai Ing-wen from taking any steps in that direction.\nHowever, US President Joe Biden said his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had agreed to abide by the \"Taiwan agreement\".\nMr Biden appeared to be referring to Washington's longstanding \"one China\" policy under which it recognises China rather than Taiwan.\nIn the BBC interview, Mr Sullivan also urged Russia not to exploit the growing energy crisis.\nHe said Moscow had in the past used energy as \"a tool of coercion and a political weapon\" - but any attempt to use the situation to its advantage would backfire on Russia.\nMr Sullivan also warned the British government that suspending the Northern Ireland Protocol to the Brexit deal would be a \"serious risk to stability\". \nHe said any possibility of a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was \"of serious concern to the US\".\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol ensures there is no need for checks along the land border between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nDuring Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority.\nAnd asked how long the US would wait while Iran delayed the resumption of talks on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal, Mr Sullivan said: \"We've just heard... that Iran is prepared to come back in a matter of a few short weeks, if that turns out not to be the case, then we will have to consult with allies and partners on a different way forward. \n\"If it does turn out to be the case, then we will see quite quickly whether the Iranians are serious at the table or whether they're simply coming to stall and delay for time. That's not a game that we're going to play.\"\nMr Sullivan stressed that the US was \"determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And we will use all the tools at our disposal to make sure that they do not\".\nIn 2015, Iran reached a deal with six powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - that saw Tehran limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.\nBut the US abandoned the agreement in 2018, raising fears that the deal would collapse completely."

      "tags": "Freedom of expression,Philippines",
      "text": "Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their fights to defend freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia.\nThe Nobel committee called the pair \"representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal\".\nThey are known for investigations that have angered their countries' rulers, and have faced significant threats.\nBoth spoke in defence of freedom of the press following their win.\nMs Ressa, who co-founded the news site Rappler, was commended for using freedom of expression to \"expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country, the Philippines\".\nThe Nobel committee said Mr Muratov, the co-founder and editor of independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, had for decades defended freedom of speech in Russia under increasingly challenging conditions.\n\"Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda,\" the committee said in a statement.\n\"Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time,\" it added. \nAward-winning journalist Ms Ressa was convicted last year of libel in a case seen as a test of Philippine press freedom.\nIn a live broadcast by Rappler, she said she was \"in shock\".\n\"This shows that the Nobel Peace Prize committee realised that a world without facts means a world without truth and trust,\" she said. \nMr Muratov dedicated his prize to reporters at Novaya Gazeta who had been killed because of their work. The award came a day after the 15th anniversary of the killing of Anna Politkovskaya - one of the paper's top investigative reporters and a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, who was shot in a lift in her block of flats.\n\"I can't take all the credit. This is thanks to Novaya Gazeta and those who died while defending people's right to freedom of speech,\" he told Russian news agency Tass.\nThe winners of the prestigious prize, worth 10m Swedish krona (\u00a3836,000; $1.1m), were chosen out of 329 candidates.\nMaria Ressa, 58, co-founded Rappler in 2012. The site now has 4.5 million followers on Facebook, and has become known for its intelligent analysis and hard-hitting investigations.\nIt is one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of President Rodrigo Duterte and his policies.\nRappler has published extensively on the populist president's deadly war on drugs, as well as taking a critical look at issues of misogyny, human rights violations and corruption. Ms Ressa has personally reported on the spread of government propaganda on social media. \nMs Ressa has faced numerous legal cases, which she says are politically motivated. The government has maintained their legitimacy.\nIn a statement, Rappler said it was \"honoured and astounded\" that its chief executive had been given the prize.\n\"It could not have come at a better time - a time when journalists and the truth are being attacked and undermined,\" it said.\nDmitry Muratov, 59, co-founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and has since worked as its editor.\nNovaya Gazeta is one of the few remaining newspapers in Russia to be highly critical of the ruling elite, particularly President Vladimir Putin.\nPublished three times a week, it regularly runs investigations into alleged corruption and other malpractice in ruling circles, and highlights the plight of people it considers victims of official abuse.\nThe newspaper has been subjected to threats and harassment, including over its reporting of human rights abuses in Chechnya.\nMs Politkovskaya is one of six Novaya Gazeta journalists and contributors to have been killed in connection with their work since 2000.\nThe Kremlin, which has frequently opposed the paper, congratulated Mr Muratov. \n\"He persistently works in accordance with his own ideals, he is devoted to them, he is talented, he is brave,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nHowever, allies of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny\u00a0criticised the Nobel committee's choice.\n\"Instead of pretentious and hypocritical speeches about 'freedom', they could protect a person who survived an assassination attempt and has been taken hostage by the murderers,\" Ruslan Shaveddinov tweeted.\nAlistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nBoth Nobel laureates have been a thorn in the side of their respective governments for years.\nMaria Ressa and Rappler have faced concerted attacks from Rodrigo Duterte's government, and her conviction last year for \"cyber-libel\" was one of a string of cases ranging from defamation to tax avoidance.\nIf Mr Duterte is trying to silence her, it hasn't worked. Rappler continues reporting on his administration, and this award will be a huge embarrassment.\nIn her own words, Ms Ressa says: \"I've committed no crime but to speak truth to power.\"\nAnd congratulations from the Russian government to Dmitry Muratov surely came through gritted teeth.\nHe fully understands the risks that come with standing up to the state but he remains optimistic, saying of state crackdowns on opposition groups: \"It's impossible to kill dissent\".\nMs Ressa and Mr Muratov are the 102nd winners of the prize. \nLast year's winner was the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which was awarded for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. \nThen US President Barack Obama took the prize in 2009 and other notable winners include child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979)."

      "text": "Two Irish government ministers are to attend a centenary church service in Armagh later this month organised by Irish church leaders.\nThe service is timed to coincide with the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. \nIrish president Michael D Higgins has previously turned down an invitation, saying the event had become politicised.\nThe SDLP has said it will be attending, while Sinn F\u00e9in confirmed it would not.\nForeign Minister Simon Coveney and government chief whip Jack Chambers will be present at the event.\nIn a statement on Thursday evening, the Irish government said in considering the invitation \"its role in this matter is clearly distinct from that of the president\".\nIt said it reiterated its \"full support and understanding\" of President Higgins' decision not to attend, which it said was \"properly made\" and based on concerns he had consistently expressed.\nBut it added: \"Cognisant of that important distinction, and in recognition also of the spirit and intentions of the church leaders in organising the event, the government has decided that it will be represented at the event.\"\nMr Coveney is a member of the Fine Gael party while Mr Chambers is a member of Fianna F\u00e1il.\nThe service will be held at St Patrick's Church of Ireland cathedral on 21 October.\nIt is being described as a service of reflection and hope, to mark the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland.\nLast month, Catholic and Protestant church leaders said they had been saddened by \"the polarised political commentary\" around the service they organised.\nSenator Gerard Craughwell, a signatory to a letter from six independent Irish senators who wrote to President Higgins asking him to reconsider his decision not to go to the service, said he did not agree with the decision to send two government ministers.\n\"The president of the country made his decision, I didn't agree with it at the time and I would still hold the same position,\" he told Good Morning Ulster on Friday.\n\"You're now having one of the most senior ministers of the cabinet countermanding the decision, for want of a better description, of the supreme leader, the president.\n\"So it's a really strange one, it's been really messed up from beginning to end as far as I can see.\n\"When the president made his decision that should have been it, if we wanted to have a representative at this event we should have found someone lower down the food chain in the Irish political system.\"\nA decision has yet to be taken by the SDLP as to who will attend the service.\nIts leader Colum Eastwood said: \"Given the choice between remaining in the trenches of the last 100 years or reaching out to build a new future, I know which side I want to be on.\"\nThe British and Irish heads of state, the Queen and President Higgins, were both invited. \nThe president's decision provoked criticism in Northern Ireland, with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saying it was a \"disappointing and retrograde step\".\nIn September, President Higgins defended his decision to decline his invitation.\nOn Thursday, Church of Ireland primate Archbishop John McDowell said the church leaders \"absolutely respect\" the decision of anyone who declines an invitation.\nSpeaking on RT\u00c9 radio, he insisted the organisers had chosen their words carefully in describing the service as \"marking\" the centenary.\n\"Not commemorate, not celebrate but to mark - which is a neutral phase - which allows for a very wide interpretation,\" he said. \n\"And it will include, and always has been planned to include, those who will want to say very clearly that partition, and the legacy of partition, have been a bitter experience for them.\"\nBBC News NI has seen a copy of the letter sent by the church leaders on 4 October to people invited to service.\nIt says: \"The service will provide the opportunity for honest reflection on the past 100 years, including an acknowledgement of different perceptions, with the recognition of failures and hurts.\n\"It will, however, also have a clear affirmation of our shared commitment to building a future marked by peace, reconciliation and a commitment to the common good.\"\nThose invited to the service have been asked to reply by 13 October."

      "tags": "Agriculture,Climate change,Food,Sustainable agriculture",
      "text": "Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade, a study has shown.\nThat reduction though is not happening quickly enough to meet a key national target, according to scientists. \nThe aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our diets.\nThis goal, set by the National Food Strategy, is based on a review of the whole UK food system - from farming and production to hunger and sustainability. \nIt recommends meat consumption in the UK fall by 30% over the next 10 years.\n\"We now know we need a more substantial reduction,\" said lead researcher Cristina Stewart from the University of Oxford. \nThe new study, published in the journal the Lancet Planetary Health, revealed that while most people are eating less red and processed meat compared to a decade ago, they are eating more white meat. \nHigh consumption of red and processed meat can increase the risk of health problems including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even certain cancers. \nMeat production also has a higher environmental impact - producing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - than other types of agriculture and food production. \nThis Oxford-based research team used data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey - a detailed survey of the dietary habits of more than 15,000 people across the country.  \nThis showed that daily meat consumption had reduced by about 17g per person per day. \nWhat it did not reveal was the reason people were changing their diets. But market research in 2019 suggested that almost 40% of meat-eaters were actively trying to reduce their consumption, with many citing either health or environmental reasons. \nDr Stewart stresses that, for those who want to reduce the environmental impact of what they eat, \"any reduction in meat will have an impact\". \n\"You don't have to be vegetarian,\" she said. \"Although, in general, meat-free dishes will have a lower impact. \n\"But if you're someone that eats meat every day, reducing your meat consumption by 30% just looks like having two meat-free days per week.\" \nThere is huge variation in the environmental impact of meat; it depends on what livestock are fed and where and how the meat is produced. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\n\"Locally produced meat has a much lower impact than meat that has been imported,\" Dr Stewart pointed out.  \nShe and her colleagues have also been studying the effect of \"environmental impact labelling\" on consumer choices. They have designed experimental labels that score a product based on its greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, water-use and water pollution. \n\"When you don't have the information about environmental impact of food, it's really hard to shop with that in mind,\" she pointed out. \nHaving the support of those we eat our meals with, the Oxford researchers say, makes it easier for us to change our diets. And the availability and prominence of meat-free food options has an effect on people's food choices, too. \n\"So, for example, if you're at a restaurant, you often see a vegetarian options 'box of shame' at the bottom of the menu rather than at the top with chef's specials,\" Dr Stewart explained.\nThe team's ongoing study of what drives people to reduce their meat consumption has revealed some simple strategies that participants have found helpful, including: \n\"Hopefully this paper will help us understand the patterns and trends so we can tailor public health policies and behavioural nudges to help people choose more sustainable options,\" said Dr Stewart. \nHear Idris and Sabrina Elba discuss the impact on the planet of what we eat on the What Planet Are We On podcast on BBC Sounds\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "tags": "Press freedom,Rodrigo Duterte,Maria Ressa,Philippines",
      "text": "She is the award-winning journalist who has been at the centre of high-profile legal battles in the Philippines and is now the recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize.\nTo many, Maria Ressa has become a symbol of the fight for press freedom in a country where journalists are under threat.\nBut Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his supporters have accused her of peddling fake news through her website Rappler.\nThis is what you need to know about the news boss who enraged the president.  \nMs Ressa was born in the Philippines, but moved to the US as a child after martial law was declared by Ferdinand Marcos in the early 1970s. \n\"I landed in New Jersey, where I could barely speak English, and I had to figure out what a short brown kid was going to do in this big white world,\" she told the BBC's Lyse Doucet.\nShe focused on education and after studying at the prestigious Princeton University, Ms Ressa returned to the Philippines to \"find roots\".\n\"I always felt that I wasn't as American as Americans and then I realised when I got back to the Philippines that I was not Filipino.\"\nMs Ressa's return to the Philippines coincided with the 1986 People Power Revolution - when Filipinos took to the streets to overthrow Marcos.  \nHer move into journalism was initially a way of learning about the country she had grown distant from, but it soon became something more. \n\"I realised 'oh my God, somebody will pay me to write a story',\" she said. \nHer new career would also lead to her first meeting with Mr Duterte in the 1980s, when he was mayor of Davao city. \nShe went on to work in a number of senior media positions - including bureau chief for US network CNN in the Philippines and Indonesia, and head of the news division of Philippine TV channel ABS-CBN. \nIn 2012, Ms Ressa co-founded the online news site Rappler, merging \"rap\" meaning to talk and \"ripples\", to make waves.\nShe had ambitions of making Rappler the biggest news site in the Philippines, so \"hired the smartest 20-somethings we could find\" and \"embraced social media\". \nRappler now has more than 4.5m followers on Facebook and has become known for its intelligent analysis and hard-hitting investigations. \nThe site gained a lot of attention in 2015, when Mr Duterte - then Davao mayor - told Ms Ressa he had killed three people. \nObservers say Ms Ressa has been central to Rappler's success. \n\"First, she has not backed down; she has continued to fight for what she believes in. She also has credibility. She has been in the industry for decades... and has done her job well. \n\"Then, she has access to international media and international connections,\" Joi Barrios-LeBlanc, a lecturer with the University of California at Berkeley's Southeast Asian Studies Department, said. \nThe BBC's Howard Johnson in Manila describes her as an engaging speaker, with a sharp analytical mind. \nShe is skilled at explaining complex social developments to her audience, particularly on the issue of social media and its influence, he adds.\nRappler is one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of Mr Duterte and his policies. \nIt has published extensively on the populist president's war on drugs, which has claimed thousands of lives.\nMs Ressa has personally reported on the spread of government propaganda on social media, while other Rappler stories have taken a critical look at issues of misogyny, human rights violations and corruption.\nIt has not gone unnoticed by Mr Duterte. Speaking to a Rappler reporter in 2018, the president said: \"If you are trying to throw garbage at us, then the least that we can do is explain - how about you? Are you also clean?\"\nThat same year, the president announced that he had banned Rappler's reporters from covering his official activities, and the government even revoked the site's operating licence. \nMs Ressa has faced numerous legal cases.\nIn 2020,  she was found guilty of \"cyber-libel\" in a case seen as a test of the country's media freedom. Rappler and Ms Ressa have also been targeted in other court cases, ranging from tax evasion to foreign ownership violations.\nMs Ressa has described all the cases against her as \"political tools\" - an assertion supported by activists and press freedom groups around the world. The government maintains their legitimacy. \nMs Barrios-LeBlanc said Ms Ressa had come to represent the plight of journalists in the Philippines, and said \"because she gained the attention of the international press, that is very significant\".\nMs Ressa was named a Time Person of the Year in 2018 for steering Rappler \"through a superstorm of the two most formidable forces in the information universe: social media and a populist President with authoritarian inclinations\".\nUpon receiving the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, she was commended for using freedom of expression to \"expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country\". \nRachael Jolley, editor of the Index on Censorship magazine, recalled meeting Ms Ressa at a journalism festival before her name was widely known. Even then, she says she quickly came to view her as an \"extraordinarily strong individual to be able to stand up to the government pressure\".\nLocal journalist Ellen Tordesillas told the BBC Ms Ressa is \"admired as one of those who stood up to Duterte\". \nBut these views are not shared by everyone and Ms Ressa has said she is well used to receiving hate mail. \nOur correspondent says Ms Ressa's reputation is tied to Mr Duterte's popularity, with his supporters directing much of the narrative about her on social media.\n\"With support for Duterte still at a significant high, and his mocking of her in the past, Ressa has been put in a sort of 'elite' category,\" an academic focused on South-East Asian studies, who asked not to be named, told the BBC last year.\n\"Her work is brilliant and much needed in keeping Duterte in check, but the populist - and outside of Manila - perception of her in the Philippines is she is 'out of touch'.\""

      "tags": "Abortion,Texas,US abortion debate,United States",
      "text": "Some Texas abortion clinics have reopened amid fears that a legal ruling which halted the state's near-total abortion ban may be short-lived. \nOther clinics have reported that concerns over lawsuits have prevented them from reopening. \nOn Wednesday, a US judge temporarily blocked the new law, which effectively bans women from having an abortion. \nTexas officials appealed against the ruling, setting the stage for further court battles in the coming months. \nAbortion care provider Whole Woman's Health, which runs four clinics across Texas, said it had already resumed offering abortion care on Thursday. \nSpeaking to reporters, Amy Hagstrom Miller, the firm's founder, said there had been an immediate spike in inquiries from patients seeking abortions in the wake of the judge's decision. \n\"Phone call volume has increased. There's actually hope from patients and staff,\" she said. \"There's a little desperation in that hope. Folks know this opportunity could be short-lived.\" \nDistrict Judge Robert Pittman's 113-page ruling earlier this week granted a request from the Biden administration to prevent enforcement of the law while its legality was being challenged. \nThis is the first legal setback for Texas since the law - which was drafted and approved by Republican politicians - was implemented.\nThe law effectively bans abortions from as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, at a time when most women will not be aware they are pregnant.\nDespite the injunction, some clinics remain hesitant to resume procedures as there is uncertainty over whether they could be sued retroactively if the law is re-instated. \nThe controversial law can be enforced by any individual from Texas or elsewhere, giving people the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point. Women who get the procedure, however, cannot be sued. \nThe law includes a provision that stipulates clinics and doctors may still be liable for abortions carried out while an emergency injunction is in place, legal experts say. \nIt remains unclear whether such a provision can be enforced, with Judge Pittman saying in his ruling that it is \"of questionable legality\". \nMs Miller said that both patients and staff at Whole Woman's Health were worried about the possibility of retroactive lawsuits. \nOther abortion clinics said they were taking a cautious approach to resuming abortion care services. \nSources within Planned Parenthood's affiliate South Texas - which operates seven clinics in San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley - said that it remained unclear when they would resume providing abortion care. \nAmong the factors preventing an immediate restart of services, sources said, are concerns about retroactive lawsuits along with the possibility of trauma for patients who may get an appointment while the emergency injunction is in place but are forced to cancel later. \nAn abortion doctor working at an independent facility in Texas - who asked to remain anonymous - told the BBC he and other reproductive specialists were \"not optimistic\" about the possibility of the appeal from Texas officials. \n\"We're going right back to where the law was on 1 September. This will be the most conservative appeals court in the US,\" he said, referring to the conservative-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Texas intends to appeal the ruling. \n\"They're going to overrule the federal judge, and it's going to go back to where it was, and we're going to be in the same boat.\" \nSupporters of the law have harshly criticised the judge's decision. \nThe anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, for example, accused judges of \"catering to the abortion industry\" and called for a \"fair hearing\" at the next stage."

      "text": "Pig farmers are facing a \"human disaster\" due to a shortage of abattoir workers, the National Farmer's Union has said.\nFarmers are already having to destroy healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the union said.\nTime is running out for the UK pig sector, the National Pig Association (NPA) warned.\nBut a government minister said businesses should pay higher wages and invest in skills.\nThe industry blames the shortage of people to slaughter pigs in abattoirs on factors including Covid and Brexit.\nThe chronic labour shortage has led to an estimated backlog of 85,000 pigs on farms, with an extra 15,000 being added per week, according to NPA figures.\nThe industry association warned on Thursday that \"empty retail shelves and product shortages are becoming increasingly commonplace and Christmas specialities, such as pigs in blankets are already under threat\".\n\"The knock-on effect of the staff shortages is having a devastating effect on the country's pig farmers,\" the NPA said.\n\"We are already seeing producers up and down the country getting out of pigs or cutting down on numbers because they cannot sustain these losses any longer,\" NPA chief executive Zoe Davies said.\n\"Without immediate government intervention, more producers will be pushed over the edge.\" \n\"Sadly we are expecting a serious contraction of the UK pig industry,\" she added, saying mainly smaller independent farmers were affected.\nAround 600 pigs have already been killed to deal with overcrowding, and a mass cull is the next stage, the industry association has said.\nSpeaking on BBC Question Time, National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said the UK is the \"first country in the world facing a cull of healthy livestock\". \nShe said pigs were having to be destroyed using either a bolt gun or lethal injection, and added: \"As far as I'm concerned this is the start and it has to be resolved.\n\"This is livelihoods and this is people's businesses.\n\"This has been a human disaster for those pig farmers who are absolutely distraught.\" \nShe said that the government must address labour shortages unless we \"don't want a pig industry in this country\" which she argued would mean \"we will import pig meat that is produced to lower standards.\" \nMs Batters said Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay were doing \"everything\" they can, but said she had not been able to see Home Secretary Priti Patel to discuss more migrant visas to address shortages. \nBut Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the industry to find sustainable solutions and that issuing temporary visas was \"not enough\".\nHe also said shortages were happening elsewhere in the world. \nMr Zahawi added that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was \"right\" to challenge businesses to pay higher wages and invest in skills.\nBut a top vet said on Wednesday that Mr Johnson was not taking the prospect of a national pig cull seriously."

      "text": "The University of Sussex's vice chancellor has defended a professor after protesters tried to have her sacked for her views on gender identity.\nStaff \"have an untrammelled right to say and believe what they think,\" Adam Tickell told BBC News.\nAn anonymous campaign included posters accusing Professor Kathleen Stock of transphobia, a claim she rejects.\nProf Stock tweeted that students shouldn't \"just expect to hear their own thoughts reflected back at them\".\nPosters put up near the University of Sussex campus and an accompanying social media campaign claimed the philosophy professor \"makes trans students unsafe\".\nPhotos also show a masked protester standing on the university's sign with a banner that reads \"Stock out\".\nProfessor Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more \"socially significant\" than biological sex, completely rejects the claim that she or her work is transphobic. \nAn Instagram account apparently linked to the campaign posted a \"mission statement\" calling for Professor Stock to be fired, alongside photos of the protest.\nThe statement claimed to be from \"an anonymous, unaffiliated group of queer, trans and non-binary students who will not allow our community to be slandered and harmed by someone who's [sic] salary comes from our pockets\".\nThe university is investigating the incidents, and will take disciplinary action if necessary, Vice Chancellor Prof Adam Tickell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.\n\"It's absolutely clear that all of our staff have an untrammelled right to say and believe what they think, so we take it very seriously if people try to prevent that right from being exercised,\" he said. \n\"I'm really concerned that we have masked protesters putting up posters calling for the sacking of somebody for exercising her right to articulate her views.\"\nProf Stock thanked the vice chancellor and her supporters on Twitter and said students should not just expect to hear their own thoughts reflected back at them.\nShe called on her colleagues to speak up, adding: \"What kind of future does a University have where intimidation determines what is said or taught?\"\nA University of Sussex spokesperson said: \"We were extremely concerned to see the harassment towards our staff member and took immediate action in response to this, which we continue to do. \n\"We are deeply committed to being a safe and inclusive university, which values and advances equality and diversity, seeks to resolve conflicts, advances good relations and upholds lawful free speech.\"\nUniversities have long had to deal with highly contentious debates on campus, but few have matched the ferocity around gender identity issues. \nPrivately, many vice chancellors say this is the most difficult issue on campus they have had to manage. \nOne of the core principles they use to navigate it is protecting freedom of speech for staff, students and visiting speakers. This is already a legal duty contained in the Education Act 1986.  \nBut now a new draft law is making its way through parliament which will require universities in England to more actively promote freedom of speech. \nThis will be overseen by the regulator, the Office for Students. Individuals who feel an institution has failed to protect their ability to speak freely will be able to take legal action.  \nSo in future, disputes could in theory escalate to fines for universities, and court cases.\n ....."

      "text": "Health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccination this winter.\nMore than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases.\nIn England the flu vaccine is being offered free to:\nFor most people the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy.\nHealth officials in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales plan to cover similar groups - with some variation.\nIn Scotland, teachers, nursery teachers and support staff in close contact with pupils are being offered the jab. \nIn Northern Ireland secondary school children in their first year can have the vaccine. Older children are eligible if they are at risk.\nPeople not included in these groups can pay for a flu vaccine at pharmacies or some supermarkets, at a cost of about \u00a315.\nHowever, officials say vaccine supplies will be prioritised for people most at risk.\nFor many people it will typically last about two weeks, and get better on its own.\nHowever, for some, flu can be very serious - particularly for older adults, very young children and people with underlying health conditions.\nThe added concern this year is that some of these people are also at greater risk of getting seriously ill from Covid.\nAnnual flu deaths vary each year, depending on the strain and other factors. Social distancing is likely to have helped to keep the number low last year. \nThere were more than 22,000 estimated deaths in the 2017-18 season, but just under 4,000 deaths in 2018-19.\nIt can be hard to tell if you have flu or coronavirus as they sometimes share similar symptoms, including:\nSome people may also experience muscle aches, a headache, sore throat and diarrhoea and vomiting with flu. \nBut these symptoms can be seen with other common winter viruses too. \nIf any doubt, it's best to get a test.\nFlu and coronavirus can also be spread before people have symptoms.\nYes, in which case you are more likely to be seriously ill.\nResearch shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone.\nAbout 30 million people in the UK are being offered a booster jab against Covid, including the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions. \nThey may be offered the flu and booster jab at the same time - but only if it's practical.\nDeputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam has said that it's safe to have both jabs simultaneously, and doesn't affect how well they work. \nMost side-effects are mild and only last a day or two, including a slightly raised temperature, muscle-ache and a sore arm where the needle went in. \nAllergic reactions are rare but you should avoid the vaccine if you have previously had a serious allergic reaction to a flu vaccine. \nPeople who have allergies to eggs should consult their pharmacist or GP to get a low-egg or egg-free vaccine. \nIt is best to avoid the vaccine if you are ill with a high temperature. You should re-book for when you are fully recovered.\nThere are several types of flu vaccine. \nChildren will typically be offered the vaccine via a a nasal spray. Adults are offered injections. \nFor adults aged 65 and over the most common vaccine includes an extra ingredient that triggers a stronger response from the immune system.\nIf you are getting your vaccine on the NHS, experts say you will be offered the one that is most effective for you - depending partly on your age and taking into account vaccine stocks.

      "tags": "China,The Moon,Space exploration",
      "text": "The rock samples brought back from the Moon in December by China's Chang'e-5 mission were really young.\nIt's all relative, of course, but the analysis shows the basalt material - the solidified remnants of a lava flow - to be just two billion years old. \nCompare this with the samples returned by the Apollo astronaut missions. They were all over three billion years of age.\nThe findings are reported in the journal Science.\nChina's robotic Chang'e-5 mission was sent to a site on the lunar nearside called Oceanus Procellarum. \nIt was carefully chosen to add to the sum of knowledge gained from previous sample returns - the last of which was conducted by a Soviet probe in 1976.\nXiaochao Che and colleagues at the Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) Center in Beijing led the Chang'e-5 dating analysis, but worked with a broad international consortium.\nThe age data they've produced is fascinating because it proves volcanism continued on the Moon long after one might have expected such a small body to have cooled down and given up the activity.\nTheorists will now be thinking through new ideas for what kind of heat source might have sustained the late-stage behaviour.\nIt doesn't appear to have been driven by concentrated radioactive decay because the Chang'e-5 samples don't contain a lot of the kind of chemical elements associated with this effect.\n\"One of the other options we discuss in the paper is maybe the Moon was able to stay active longer because of its orbital interactions with Earth,\" speculated Dr Katherine Joy, a co-author from the University of Manchester, UK.\n\"Maybe the Moon wobbled back and forth on its orbit, resulting in what we call tidal heating. So, a bit like the Moon generates ocean tides on Earth, maybe the gravitational effect of the Earth could stretch and flex the Moon to generate frictional melting,\" she told BBC News.\nOne really important outcome from the study is the way it helps calibrate the crater-counting technique that is used for dating planetary surfaces.\nScientists assume that the more craters they see on a surface, the older that terrain must be; and also, obviously, in the reverse: the presence of very few craters is suggestive of a surface that has only recently been laid or remodelled.\nBut this technique has to be anchored in some absolute dates that are derived from measured samples, and for the Moon the chronology was not well constrained between one and three billion years ago. \nThe Chang'e-5 material now provides a precise waypoint in the middle of this time period.\nProf Brad Jolliff, from Washington University in St Louis, US, is another co-author in the consortium. He's now hoping China will send its next sample return mission to a region on the Moon's farside called South Pole Aitken Basin.\nThis vast depression, some 2,500km wide and up to 8km deep, was created by a spectacular impactor very early in lunar history.\n\"If Chang'e-6 goes to South Pole Aitken it will give us the age of the oldest big impact basin on the Moon, and that provides a very different part of the calibration, in the range of four to four-and-a-half billion years ago. We don't know what the flux of big impactors was back then, and a sample from the South Pole Aitken Basin region has the potential to answer the question.\"   \nChang'e-5 marked the start of an astonishing few months for China's national space programme. \nWithin six months of the lunar probe returning home with its rock samples on 16 December, another spacecraft had successfully entered orbit around Mars to place a rover on its surface; and Chinese astronauts had begun the occupation of a new space station at Earth."

      "title": "Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?",
      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "text": "The number of countries on the UK Covid travel red list will be cut from 54 to seven, the government says.\nSouth Africa, Brazil and Mexico come off the red list, which requires travellers to quarantine in an approved hotel at their cost for 10 full days.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes begin on Monday and \"mark the next step\" in opening travel.\nThis latest move will be seen as a boost to the airline industry and families separated during the pandemic.\nPanama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Haiti and the Dominican Republic remain on the red list.\nPandemic travel rules in the UK have recently been simplified, with the amber list cut, and advice against holidays changed for 32 countries.\nBut consumer group Which? warned the changes only reflect requirements for arriving back in the UK. \n\"Travellers should be aware that they may still face restrictions on entry to many destinations, especially those under 18 who are not yet vaccinated,\" it said.\nArrivals from 37 more destinations will have their vaccination status certificates recognised, meaning they can avoid more expensive post-arrival testing requirements.\nVaccinated travellers from Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey will be treated the same as returning fully-vaccinated UK residents so long as they have not visited a red-list country in the 10 days before arriving in England.\nAll arrivals will still complete a passenger locator form.\nThe Scottish government said the changes were \"agreed on a four-nation basis\".\nThe Welsh government said that they increased opportunities for new infections and variants, but it was adopting them because it was not practical to have its own border policy.\nFor British expats Matt and Hannah Pirnie, who have lived in South Africa for a decade, the country's removal from the red list will mean it is easier to see family again.\n\"It's been a long pandemic for us. Not seeing family, not being allowed to go back, but more importantly grandparents not being able to come here and see their grandkids. It's been a long two years,\" Matt says.\n\"First of all when all the aeroplanes stopped initially - that was quite anxiety provoking - and then to be put on the red list for so long has just been quite hard to wrap your head around why,\" Hannah adds.\n\"Taking three children into a prison-like mentality was just a no-go, plus the cost. It's been quite hard really.\"\nAnnouncing the latest changes, Mr Shapps said the government was \"making it easier for families and loved ones to reunite\".\nHe said that with fewer restrictions \"and more people travelling, we can all continue to move safely forward together along our pathway to recovery\".\nIn addition to the shorter red list, the government said passengers would soon be able to use a photograph of a lateral flow test as a minimum requirement to verify a negative result.\nThis change - affecting tests taken by eligible fully-vaccinated people from non-red list countries two days after arrival in England - would come into effect in \"late October\", the Department for Transport (DfT) said.\nA UK government source said the government still aimed to replace the so-called day two \"PCR test on arrival\" with a cheaper lateral flow test by the half-term break, for many schools in England after 22 October.\nBut they said the government was still working on a date for when the new testing rule would be introduced. \nUnder current rules, travellers must use more expensive PCR tests for their post-arrival day two screening. People who are not fully vaccinated must provide a further PCR test on day eight.\nThe DfT said NHS lateral flow devices cannot be used for the purpose of international travel. \"Both pre-departure tests and on arrival tests must be bought from private providers,\" it said.\nAirlines and the travel industry praised a \"much-improved system\" but called on ministers to implement changes to testing as soon as possible and consider scrapping tests for passengers arriving from low-risk countries.\nA spokesperson for London's Heathrow Airport said the announced changes would \"kick start a global Britain\". \n\"However, the missing piece to this is clarity on when cheaper lateral flow tests will be accepted, which is now critical in order to save the half-term getaway for many,\" they said.\nA further 40,701 new coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Thursday, alongside another 122 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe following destinations will be removed from the red list from 04:00 BST on Monday:\nAfghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, Cape Verde, Chile, Congo (Democratic Republic), Costa Rica, Cuba. Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, French Guiana, Georgia, Guyana, Indonesia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mayotte, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Paraguay, Philippines, R\u00e9union, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nSource: Department for Transport"

      "tags": "Construction industry,Students,Glasgow",
      "text": "A luxury student accommodation complex in Glasgow has been branded a \"filthy and unfinished building site\".\nThe Cathedral Street property, named Bridle Works, is billed as having a \"range of top-class amenities\" including a gym and rooftop terrace.\nBut students have complained to provider Novel Student as they felt they were \"misled\" over conditions.\nThe firm said the pandemic had affected construction and it was \"disappointed\" to hear the students' experiences.\nIn a letter seen by the BBC, 38 international students detail a list of complaints including:\nOne post-graduate student - who asked to remain anonymous - told BBC Scotland she arrived in the country from abroad last month.\nThe 22-year-old said she found the accommodation via the University of Strathclyde website. BBC Scotland found links to the property from the university's student association site.\nShe paid more than \u00a310,000 up front for a year's stay at Bridle Works.\nFour days after she made the payment, however, the company informed her that her room was still under construction - a fortnight before she was due to move in mid-September.\nShe said: \"I was told by a couple of other international students it would be difficult to secure a place in the city this year due to an ongoing housing shortage and the UN conference. However, I managed to be linked to Bridle Works.\n\"There was never any mention online, on the phone calls or in any correspondence with Novel Student that it was still under construction until after I paid my rent.\n\"I felt it was incredibly misleading as my parents and I were under the impression it was finished.\"\nNovel Student offered to reimburse rent costs for days missed at the property and accommodate students in hotels in Glasgow.\nHowever, the student said she was told she could live on a lower floor until her room was ready.\nShe added: \"I arrived in Scotland and then moved into what was evidently a construction site. \n\"My room just gets coated with dirt. I can only open my window at night, and have to vacuum three times a day to manage the dust from internal construction. Not how I want to spend my time.\n\"What was advertised was a space that has amenities, where you can peacefully study in your room. But what we got was a place full of hazards and noise. It was the opposite of peaceful.\n\"I have counted 40 fire alarms since I moved in last month, sometimes in the middle of the night. And those are just the ones I am home for.\"\nThe 20-floor development advertises 422 rooms starting at \u00a3238 per week.\nOn its website, Novel Student said: \"You won't have to splash on extra gym memberships, or laundry fees, making it much more affordable for student life.\n\"All bills are also included in your rent, so you can set your budget for the month without having to worry about any unpleasant surprises.\"\nBBC Scotland understands issues have been shared in a WhatsApp group comprising 81 students.\nIn written statements also included in the letter of complaint, one student said: \"When I moved in [my room] was extremely dirty with dirty water hand marks on my banisters and door frames. \n\"When I wiped down the inside of my cupboards, the cloth I used turned black. I have only gotten hot water after a week of staying here and when I first moved in, my radiator fell off the wall.\n\"Not to mention, my sprinkler cover fell off my ceiling the other day with no warning. My friend's room has literal holes in the flooring.\"\nAnother student wrote that none of the amenities advertised by Novel Student had been provided apart from the gym, where they said \"half the machines\" were not working.\nThey also said one out of four lifts in the building can be used by tenants as the rest are being used by construction crew.\nNovel Student - which runs other sites in Edinburgh, Belfast and Sheffield - said it is \"committed to delivering exceptional student experiences\".\nIn a statement, it said: \"We are naturally disappointed to hear of any resident experiences that fall short of that.\n\"The Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly presented significant challenges to our operations given the three-month construction shutdown - a universal obstacle experienced by companies working in different capacities across the real estate industry.\n\"It is our goal to always ensure the on-time delivery of products to residents, and given the significant challenges we have faced, we have had to accelerate this process to the best of our ability.\"\nIt added: \"We greatly appreciate the patience of our residents as we navigate these challenges and sympathize with the disruptions they have endured over the last several weeks.\n\"Out of respect for the privacy of the entire community, residents and staff alike, we cannot comment publicly on more specific matters concerning our residents.\"\nThe University of Strathclyde said it had no agreement with Novel and had not referred any students there. \n\"Our website links to a housing guide created by Strath Union which lists all of the major private student accommodation providers in Glasgow but does not make any recommendations or endorse any provider, as stated on the guide,\" a spokesman said.  \n\"We are concerned to hear about these issues. The Strath Union Advice Hub and the University are working together to support students who are experiencing a range of issues. We would advise any student who is having difficulties with private accommodation to contact university support services for advice and support.\""

      "text": "Covid passes have been extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls in Wales.\nThe new rule comes into effect from Monday.\nPeople in Wales already required an NHS Covid pass to legally enter nightclubs and large events.\nAnyone aged over 18 is required to show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 24 hours.\nSo how do you get a Covid pass, how will they work and how does Wales compare with the rest of the UK?\nAnyone who is aged over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result in the previous 48 hours, can get a pass.\nHowever they are only compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nPasses are also a way of proving you do not need to self-isolate, if you have been identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case and can be used when travelling abroad.\nThe Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 05:00 and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes.\nThat means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs that have a late licence.\nVenues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor.\nThe NHS Covid Pass is available digitally but you need to register for an NHS login via the website.\nYou will need to upload a photo of your ID (passport, full UK driving licence, full European driving licence). \nThis will allow you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, a computer or laptop.\nYour NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIt's worth noting that in Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England. This is also different to the NHS Covid-19 app which alerts you if you've been close to someone with the virus.\nIf you do not have photographic ID you will need to request a paper NHS Covid certificate.\nCall 0300 303 5667 for a paper copy at least five days after your final dose.\nIt is an offence to deliberately use a fake Covid pass or produce a fake lateral flow test (LFT).\nPeople caught using fake LFTs or a fake Covid pass could be given a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) of \u00a360.\nThis can be reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days, but if it's not a first offence the FPN would double to \u00a3120.\nIf there is any doubt about whether documents are real, the Welsh government said a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) should be contacted.\nIf venues do not follow the rules, they could receive an improvement or closure notice, FPN or be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nPasses have been freely available for some time and venues could already read it with existing technology.\nBut if they don't have the verifier app, they may judge them by sight.\nFestivals, such as Green Man in the Brecon Beacons, have already been using the system.\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"These measures are examples of what Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] calls low-cost interventions, which may be enough to prevent the need for tougher restrictions later on.\"\nCouncil enforcement teams will work with businesses to check they are following the rules.\nFor those people living close to the border, your GP may actually be in England.\nIn that case you may need to use the NHS App system for England.\nSince 1 October, people in Scotland have needed a Covid vaccination certificate to enter nightclubs, adult entertainment venues and large-scale events.\nThe UK government decided not to go ahead with vaccine passports in England, despite saying they would be introduced at the end of September.\nBut they might be considered again later, if there is a Covid surge over the winter.\nNorthern Ireland has not yet announced whether it will introduce a similar scheme.\nThe rules also apply to those coming to Wales. The idea is that visiting teams will let fans know.\nThere may be some flexibility on checks to avoid long queues outside stadiums. \nBut venues should be ready to work with the police and councils to decide when it is reasonable to relax checks.\nIt renews for 30 days every time you download it.\nThis has been a tricky one that the cabinet has been wrestling with, having met four times to debate the issue.\nThe first minister said they were \"acutely aware\" of the implications for civil liberties and were giving relevant sectors time to prepare before passes were introduced on 11 October.\nHowever, he added people also had rights to live in a society where everyone takes \"reasonable measures\" to keep each other safe.\nThe Welsh government also hopes introducing Covid passes will improve vaccination rates, particularly among younger people.\nJodie Beck, from human rights group Liberty, said: \"While we welcome the decision to not exclude those who have not received the vaccine from attending large events, the introduction of a vaccine pass in Wales still sets a dangerous precedent.\n\"Vaccine passports under any name mean more coercion and division, and risk creating a two-tier society where people who are already marginalised will see their rights and autonomy most affected.\"\nGenerally, no. The Welsh government wanted to avoid excluding those who have not had, or been able to have, a vaccine by including those with a recent negative test.\nHowever, workers, performers and so on, will not require a pass as there are already rules in place for employers to safeguard workers."

In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "title": "Covid-19: Wales set for 'more normal' Christmas and travel joy for Novavax volunteers",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPeople in Wales can look forward to a more normal Christmas than last year - as long as nothing unexpected happens - Mark Drakeford has said. Setting out his autumn and winter plan, the first minister said he expected businesses to be able to stay open. But if unexpected pressures emerge, such as a new variant which risks overwhelming the NHS, restrictions could be reintroduced. \nPeople who took part in trials of Covid vaccines which haven't been approved yet will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say. It means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad with fewer restrictions. Darren Green, 51, who received Novavax in a trial, said he \"felt a bit emotional\" when he heard the news and he would no longer have to cancel a trip abroad with friends.\nThere's more good news for travellers, after the Foreign Office lifted its advice to avoid holidays in 51 destinations, including the Bahamas, Jamaica and Cameroon. The change will make it easier for visitors to get travel insurance - but people should still check for other entry requirements such as proof of vaccination or testing and quarantine rules. Meanwhile, the transport secretary has said he hopes to relax rules on testing in time for families returning from half-term holidays at the end of October. There are plans to allow fully vaccinated people coming to England to take a cheaper lateral flow test, rather than a PCR test, two days after their arrival. But Grant Shapps did not give an exact date for when the requirements would change. Catch up on the latest changes to the UK's travel rules here. \nThe US added a disappointing 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to drag on the economy, official figures show. The unemployment rate fell from 5.2% in August to 4.8% - but with 7.7 million out of work, unemployment remained considerably higher than before the pandemic. The data was collected in mid-September, when the spread of Delta across the US was near its peak, and experts say Americans have been eating out and travelling less, as well as delaying their return to the office because of this. \nA professor who recovered from Covid is to sing a new piece of choral music based on the diaries of nurses who treated him when he was in intensive care. Prof Peter Johnstone, 72, spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, last year. Later this month he'll be one of the singers at the London premiere of the work, which features lyrics based on diaries written at the end of each shift to help fill the gaps in his memory when he regained consciousness. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nTo see how the vaccine rollout is going in the UK, check out our visual guide here.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The UK government is refusing to reveal what it told the Premier League about the Saudi-backed takeover of Newcastle United because it could \"harm\" relations with Saudi Arabia.\nThe government says it did not get involved in the deal, which has been criticised by human rights activists.\nBut the Foreign Office is known to have held meetings with the Premier League to discuss it.\nThe BBC asked for details of these meetings under Freedom of Information.\nThe Foreign Office responded with a redacted copy of the agenda for one meeting, which took place on 14 May 2020, and a redacted copy of the minutes of another meeting on 10 June 2020. \nHowever, it declined to provide further details requested by the BBC, including a list of attendees and the full minutes.\nLabour MP for Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Central, Chi Onwurah, who has been critical of the way the Premier League handles takeovers, said: \"The lack of transparency and accountability by the Premier League and government is a sign of broken football governance.\n\"This is the first time we've heard it's an issue of diplomacy. There will be many fans who have concerns about Saudi Arabia's human rights record - if the government raised concerns, we deserve to know about it.\"\nIn its letter to the BBC in March this year, the Foreign Office said: \"We acknowledge that releasing information on this issue would increase public knowledge about our relations with Saudi Arabia.\"\nBut officials added: \"The disclosure of information detailing our relationship with the Saudi government could potentially damage the bilateral relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia.\n\"This would reduce the UK government's ability to protect and promote UK interests through its relations with Saudi Arabia which would not be in the public interest.\"\nThe government confirmed that the meeting on 14 May was attended by representatives from the Foreign Office, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for International Trade and the Premier League. \nThe 10 June meeting was between the Foreign Office and the Premier League.\nThe redacted minutes of that meeting say there was uncertainty about the \"exact timeline for a PL [Premier League] decision\" but it was \"becoming closer\".\nIt added that the Premier League was \"committed\" to keeping the government \"informed both at a working-level [redacted]\".\nOn Thursday, the Premier League approved the takeover of Newcastle United after receiving \"legally binding\" assurances that Saudi Arabia would not control the club.\nEighty per cent of the funding for the deal will come from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) which is seen as separate from the state, despite the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman acting as chair for the body. \nMany Newcastle fans celebrated the deal which could see increased investment in the club, following Mike Ashley's 14-year reign as owner.\nAmnesty International UK described the takeover as \"an extremely bitter blow for human rights defenders\".\nThe Saudi Arabian authorities have jailed women's rights activists and Western intelligence agencies believe the country's crown prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi - something he denies.\nHomosexuality is outlawed in the country and campaigners say same-sex acts are punishable by death.\nSaudi Arabia is an important trade partner for the UK, who after the US is the second largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia.\nThis relationship has been an important one for the UK's defence industry, dating back to 1985 when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed the Al-Yamamah arms deal with the country.\nThe UK government has made a concerted effort not to get involved with the takeover of Newcastle United, a senior source has told the BBC.\nOfficials from both the Department for Media, Culture and Sport and the Foreign Office have been in regular contact with the Premier League for updates.\nAn insider said the involvement of the Saudis made it \"quite a difficult one\" but the government wanted to \"let the deal play out.\"\nSports minister Nigel Huddleston has said that he is \"keeping an eye on\" the takeover but that acquisitions of any team is \"an issue for football\". \nHe said he expected a fit and proper test to be applied but added: \"At the end of the day we've got to trust football to do its job and look after itself\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was \"very concerned\" by the takeover of the football club, adding that all such deals should go to an independent regulator.\nHe added that it was not for him as a politician to say who should own football clubs.\nFormer sports minister Tracey Crouch - who is currently undertaking a review into English football - has said she is in favour of an independent regulator to address corporate governance.

      "tags": "Comedy,Television,Disability,Cerebral Palsy",
      "text": "Comedian Rosie Jones has said getting online abuse after appearing on BBC One's Question Time has made her \"more determined\" to speak up for minorities.\nJones, who has cerebral palsy, appeared on the programme's panel on Thursday.\nShe tweeted: \"The sad thing is that I'm not surprised at the ableist abuse I've received. It's indicative of the country we live in right now.\n\"I will keep on speaking up, in my wonderful voice, for what I believe in.\"\nThe comedian and actress, who is known for TV shows like 8 Out of 10 Cats and The Last Leg, said the negative reaction had only served to strengthen her resolve.\n\"A lot of my job is going on stage and telling silly jokes about my boobies,\" she said on ITV's Loose Women on Friday.\n\"So actually to be given a platform where I can speak more seriously about what it's like to be disabled and gay and a woman in this country right now, it feels like such a powerful opportunity.\n\"Unfortunately after my appearance last night I got a lot of abuse online about how I look and about how I sound and about my disability, and actually that makes me more determined to speak out for minorities because this country needs to be a better and more accepting place to live in.\"\nAnalysis by Entertainment reporter Alex Taylor\nThe response to Rosie Jones's Question Time appearance underlines an uncomfortable truth - society is used to disability being discussed, but not so much disabled people making their own voices heard.\nCultural representation of disability, led by the media, has traditionally been confined to one-note issues of need, such as social care, or Paralympic-esque inspiration narratives. Jones's vocal opinions on a variety of social and political issues challenged this.\nThe abuse she received reflects the need for change as disability continues to be the most underrepresented area of diversity across the media. Like her, I have cerebral palsy.\nBut Jones's steadfast defiance also proves the power of representation. It's why the BBC has rightly committed to improving representation of disabled talent on and off-screen, in line with disability storylines in Sex Education and Breaking Bad. \nSocial media hate doesn't take away words or experiences. Jones's words on Question Time proved that. It does however empower the need for change. \nJones was on the political debate programme with Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi, shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy, National Farmers' Union president Minette Batters, and LBC broadcaster Nick Ferrari.\nShe received support from the likes of TV presenter and author Richard Osman, fellow comedians Shaparak Khorsandi and Kerry Godliman, and the disability charity Scope.\nKhorsandi added her voice, saying: \"We are all your army against this hate... I never had a Rosie Jones in the comedy world that I loved as a kid. Very delighted my children do.\""

      "text": "Using new methods to heat just six homes can have the same impact as taking 60,000 cars off the road, a housing association has said.\nCoastal Housing, which manages 5,000 homes in south Wales, said this demonstrated the current scale of carbon emissions from heating homes.\nBut chief executive Debbie Green said it also showed change was possible.\nThe heating of buildings is currently responsible for up to 10% of all Welsh emissions.\nBut Ms Green said that over a period of 60 years there would be a reduction of 180,000kg (28,345 stone) of carbon emissions if six of their new homes were compared with traditional homes.\nSteven Potter, who lives in one of the homes with his wife Michelle and their son, said: \"It's totally different from where we lived before. You haven't got gas central heating here, you've got solar panels.\"\nHe said it had helped the family's finances \"100%\" as their monthly bills were now about \u00a343 a month - less than half of what energy regulator Ofgem calculates as the average dual fuel bill (\u00a395).\nMrs Potter said: \"We couldn't be happier.\"\nShe said their son suffered with asthma, which had been \"really bad\" in their previous home because it was damp.\n\"Since we've lived here I'm hardly giving him any asthma pumps which is really beneficial for his health. It's really good,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government has set a target for 20,000 low-carbon houses to be built for social rent before the next Senedd elections. It has said it wants the public sector to be carbon neutral by 2030.\nPolicy makers are encouraging the installation of better insulation so less energy is lost into the atmosphere.\nThey are also looking at new ways to build homes so the materials used and the way homes are built has less of an impact on the environment.\nMost homes in Wales are older, traditionally built and dependent on fossil fuels like oil and gas for heating.\nIfan Glyn, Wales director at the Federation Of Master Builders, said: \"The task of improving the energy efficiency of 1.4 million Welsh homes could provide local builders with a once-in-a-generation opportunity as they are ideally placed to carry out the work. \n\"To be in a position to make the most of this opportunity, builders will need to see a clear and enticing pipeline of work. \n\"They will also need information and guidance on the skills required and be able to acquire these skills cost-effectively and within their own communities.\" \nHe added that retrofit works needed to become mainstream among consumers by providing homeowners with better guidance and financial incentives. \nCoastal Housing Association's homes in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, were built using Welsh larch wood, used recycled paper as insulation, and were fitted with solar panels to produce electricity to run the house. \n\"These six homes save, over 60 years, 180,000 kilograms of carbon - which is the equivalent of planting two million trees or taking 60,000 cars off the road,\" said Ms Green. \n \"It's not just about housing people. There will be new jobs required for the people fitting these products\u2026 This is going to create jobs that lots of people will be able to do or their children will be able to train in and do when they leave school.\"\nTy-Mawr Lime, near Brecon in Powys, has been developing a range of natural products to insulate or improve older houses.\nEstablished more than 25 years ago by Joyce and Nigel Gervis, the company now employs 26 people.\nThey are the only company in the UK using Welsh wool to make insulation. The wool is washed and made into insulation that reduces noise, keeps in heat and allows a building to \"breathe\".\n\"I'm a sheep farmer's daughter so wanted to do something with wool insulation and started to discover then, 30 years ago, that in New Zealand they were actually making insulation from sheep's wool and we thought, 'that's fantastic',\" said Joyce Gervis. \nBy using Welsh wool they believed they could increase farmers' incomes and be more environmentally friendly. \n \"A lot of what we are looking at now are earth mortars, stuff that's coming out of the ground, what can we use that's actually there,\" added Nigel Gervis."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has appointed former Tesco chief executive Sir David Lewis to advise it on how to fix the supply chain crisis that has led to petrol and other shortages.\nIt comes as the Office for National Statistics found one in six UK adults said they had been unable to buy essential foods in the last fortnight.\nThe recent fuel crisis was caused in part by a shortage of lorry drivers.\nBrexit and the pandemic have both contributed to labour shortages.\nThe ONS found that 17% of adults said they had not been able to buy essential food items because they were not available, and almost a quarter (23%) said the same for non-essential food items.\nThe government said businesses had faced a range of challenges over recent months as they recovered from the coronavirus pandemic which has affected supply chains across Europe and around the world.\nMr Johnson said: \"There are currently global supply issues which we are working with industry to mitigate, and Dave brings a wealth of experience which will help us continue to protect our businesses and supply chains.\"\nA statement said this would include \"both identifying the causes of current blockages and pre-empting potential future ones, and advising on resolutions either through direct government action or through industry with government support\".\nSir Dave left the supermarket giant in September last year after helping mend its fortunes following a major accounting scandal.\nHe has been appointed until the end of the year and will start work in his new role on Monday.\nMany businesses in the UK have been reporting supply chain issues. \nA shortage of HGV drivers and specialised workers has led to gaps on supermarket shelves and problems with fuel supplies failing to reach petrol forecourts.\nThe body representing the road haulage industry has estimated there is currently a shortfall of about 100,000 drivers, although it said there was already a significant shortage of drivers before the pandemic and Brexit. Changes to the way drivers are taxed has also put some off.\nOn Thursday, a trade body representing thousands of fuel retailers called for an independent inquiry into the continuing supply problems for petrol and diesel, which have led to panic-buying and lengthy queues.\nAlongside the driver shortage issues, some manufacturers have also said a global shortage of computer chips and rising shipping costs for products from China is adding to the bottleneck and extra costs.\nHundreds of container ships are still queuing for access to overloaded ports, mostly in the US and China.  Port closures caused by Covid-19 outbreaks have further exacerbated the problem. \nMeanwhile, shortages of workers in food processing, hospitality and the care sector have been reported after some overseas workers returned home due to Brexit and the pandemic and chose not to return to the UK.\nRetailers have also said they face a struggle to ensure supplies are in place for the crucial Christmas trading period.\nEarlier this week, Tesco's current chief executive Ken Murphy said there would \"be bumps in the road in the run-up to Christmas\". \n\"We're seeing our share of challenges,\" he said.\nNestle, the producer of Quality Street and Lion bars. has also said it is experiencing some supply chain problems ahead of the Christmas period.\nNestle chief executive Mark Schneider said: \"Like other businesses, we are seeing some labour shortages and some transportation issues but it's our UK team's top priority to work constructively with retailers to supply them\".\nWhen asked whether he could guarantee Quality Street would be in the shops this Christmas he replied: \"We are working hard.\"\nFarmers are warning of a Christmas turkey shortage because visa changes to allow labour recruitment from abroad have come too late. \nSome 600 pigs have already been shot and a mass cull is \"the next stage\", according to the National Pig Association (NPA), which said the sector was also experiencing staff shortages due to Brexit and Covid. The NPA said mature pigs have continued to \"back up\" on farms.\nThe Toy Retailers Association has said shoppers may struggle to find what they want, while John Lewis says it is chartering a fleet of extra ships to make sure it has Christmas stock on time."

Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,UK economy,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "Households will again see \"significant rises\" in energy prices next spring, regulator Ofgem has warned.\nIts chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, would go up again because of the \"unprecedented\" rise in gas prices.\nThe cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April.\nNatural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. \nAs a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it.\nLast month, nine of those companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers.\nOfgem's Mr Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but \"legitimate costs have to be passed through\".\nHe said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future.\nHowever, he added that the regulator might have to look at the formula according to which the cap was set.\nHis warning comes as domestic customers are still reeling from the latest price cap increase, which took effect for households in England, Scotland and Wales this month.\nHouseholds in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.\nThe energy crisis falls into three broad stages for UK consumers and businesses.\nFirstly, the here and now. Domestic customers have seen a rise in direct debit demands and bills from suppliers. They are, however, protected from the extreme cost of gas on the wholesale markets by the price cap. Businesses are not. Many are seeing instant and large increases in their energy bills.\nSecondly, as Ofgem confirms, significantly higher energy prices in the spring are inevitable, potentially adding hundreds of pounds to an annual household bill. That is something which customers can do nothing to stop.\nThirdly, a review by the regulator will consider the extent to which the price cap protects customers versus the extra burden it places on all bill payers picking up the cost if the cap causes suppliers to fold.\nAt any point in this process, the government can step in. Thus far, it has shown little appetite to do so. \nWhen the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills.\nThat was the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThe next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February, but will come into force in April.\nEven if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable.\nAnalysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by \u00a3400, meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay about \u00a31,660 a year.\nOn Thursday, National Energy Action, a charity, said that between 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households could be hit by fuel poverty next year.\nMeanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold talks later on Friday with representatives of industries which have the heaviest energy consumption, such as steel, cement and chemicals.  \nWhile the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices.\nThey have called for government help to control costs and keep plants open.  \nThe UK has lower levels of gas stored than many other European countries, making it more exposed to global price volatility.\nMr Kwarteng said on Twitter protecting consumers from rising global gas prices was \"his top priority\".\nHis meeting with the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) will include representative bodies UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, the Confederation of Paper Industries, the Mineral Products Association, the British Glass Manufacturers Federation, the British Ceramic Confederation, BOC, Air Products and the Major Energy Users Council.\nAhead of the meeting, the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, told the BBC that the government needed to step in to help industries cope with the rising cost of energy.\n\"If the government does nothing, then tomorrow there'll be a steel crisis, and in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel, is but for the UK economy as a whole,\" he added.\nLast month, high gas prices forced two fertiliser factories to close, cutting supplies of carbon dioxide which is widely used in food production."

      "text": "The public are being reminded to come forward for their flu jab to maximise their protection ahead of winter.\nHealth officials are worried because this will be the first winter Covid and flu circulate fully at the same time.\nResearch shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone.\nMore than 40 million people across the UK - 35 million in England - are being offered a jab this year in the biggest flu vaccination campaign so far.\nAnd this includes, for the first time, all secondary-school children up to the age of 16.\nAlongside the extended flu campaign, the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions are also being offered a Covid booster jab this autumn and winter.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the newly formed UK Health Security Agency, warned the level of immunity to flu was likely to be lower this winter because very little of the virus had been circulating last year, because of social distancing and lockdown.\n\"It is really important people get vaccinated,\" she said.\n\"This is the first winter where we will have seasonal flu and Covid co-circulating.\"  \nProf Wendy Barclay, professor of virology at Imperial College London, told the BBC's Today Programme that it had been trickier to gauge which flu strains to cover with this year's vaccine because cases had been so low last year. \n\"The vaccine this year is updated to match what we predict will be the circulating strains,\" she said.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said \"we need to take this seriously and defend ourselves\" by taking the vaccines when offered.\n\"Both these viruses are serious: they can both spread easily, cause hospitalisation and they can both be fatal,\" he said.\nFlu kills about 11,000 people on average every winter in England and during the last bad flu winter of 2017-18 the toll was more than double that - with more than 300 deaths a day during the peak.\nFlu and the other winter viruses also lead to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day in winter months - more, currently, than is being seen for Covid.\nAnd this winter, respiratory illness could hit very high levels, causing severe strain on the NHS and up to 60,000 deaths, according to a report from the Academy of Medical Sciences.\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of hospital admission in the under-fives, is already circulating at much higher levels than normal. \nThe winter warning comes as the government launches an advertising campaign, featuring TV medics Dr Amir Khan, Dr Dawn Harper and Dr Karan Ranj, to encourage those eligible to come forward for both the flu and Covid boosters.\nThe following groups are among those eligible for winter vaccines:\nGP surgeries will contact patients eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine or eligible patients can book an appointment at a pharmacy.\nPeople who qualify for the coronavirus booster are being told to wait until they are contacted.\nAnyone who is not eligible for a free flu jab can pay for it privately at many pharmacies, at a cost of about \u00a315.\nWhat questions do you have about the flu vaccine?"

      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump \"grossly exaggerated\" the profitability of his Washington DC hotel, a probe by a congressional committee has found. \nIt also said he appeared to hide \"potential conflicts of interest\".\nThe Trump International Hotel lost over $70m (\u00a351.3m) during his term, though Mr Trump had previously claimed it earned at least $150m during that time.\nThe Trump Organization has denied wrongdoing and called the report \"misleading\". \nIn a statement, the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform said that documents provided by the General Services Administration (GSA) - which oversees federal spending - showed that Mr Trump had \"grossly exaggerated the financial health\" of the hotel. \nLosses forced Mr Trump's holding company to inject at least $24m to help the struggling hotel, located just a few blocks from the White House, the committee said.\nThe report also found Mr Trump seemed to have \"concealed potential conflicts of interest\" related to his ownership of the hotel and his roles as its lender and the guarantor of third-party loans. \nNewly obtained documents show that the hotel received $3.7m in payments from foreign governments - enough to cover 7,400 nights at the hotel on an average daily rate, according to the committee.\nThe lawmakers said that the amount raised concerns about potential violations of constitutional regulations aimed at preventing foreign influence on federal officials. \nThe oversight report found that during the four years of his administration, Mr Trump also received \"significant financial benefit\" from Deutsche Bank.\nThe Democrat-led committee said this allowed Mr Trump to delay making payments on a $170m loan for six years, and that he did not publicly disclose this benefit from a foreign bank while president.\nLawmakers have asked for additional documents from the GSA on the hotel, including on foreign payments and loans.\nIn a statement sent to the media, the Trump Organization called the report \"intentionally misleading, irresponsible and unequivocally false\" and described it as \"political harassment\".  \nThe hotel was opened to the public in September 2016, several weeks after Mr Trump accepted the Republican Party's nomination for president. \nIn 2017, Mr Trump resigned from his companies, and placed them in a trust to be run by his sons.\nBut the Office of Government Ethics said at the time that Mr Trump's plan didn't \"meet the standards\" of former presidents. In 2019, an internal GSA watchdog said the agency had chosen to \"ignore\" the Constitution when allowing the Trump Hotel to keep its lease after Mr Trump's election.\nThe Trump Organization has been looking for buyers for the 263-room hotel since 2019, but has so far been unable to sell the property.

They should have no place in society and no place in policing. It is vital that, individually and as an organisation, we challenge our own and each other's behaviours in relation to misogynistic attitudes and actions.\"\nThe chief constable added: \"We have a duty and an opportunity to lead a change which improves the experiences of all women, including our own officers and staff. This starts with enabling and supporting those who speak up, who have a right to be heard without fear of detriment or victimisation.\"\nThe tribunal, which concluded earlier this week, found that Ms Malone was an \"entirely credible and reliable witness\", but the evidence of her former superior, Insp Keith Warhurst, was \"contradictory, confusing and ultimately incredible\". \nInsp Warhurst sent an email in January 2018 saying two female firearms officers should not be deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty. \nPolice Scotland apologised unreservedly to Ms Malone and said it would address the issues raised in the judgement \"as a matter of urgency\".  \nMs Malone told BBC Scotland she was \"extremely emotional and phenomenally grateful\". \nHer solicitor, Margaret Gibbon, described the employment tribunal's judgement as \"damning\". \nIn order to support colleagues who speak out about misogyny, Chief Constable Livingstone said the force would put in place recommendations from Dame Elish Angiolini's independent review of complaints about the police.\nHe also insisted the force's hiring and promotion protocols were based on values which \"stand against any discriminatory or misogynistic mindsets or behaviour\".\nHe added: \"As police officers and staff, we stand in a unique position of trust and authority.

      "text": "A suicide bomb attack on a mosque in the Afghan city of Kunduz has killed at least 50 people, officials say, in the deadliest assault since US forces left.\nBodies were seen scattered inside the Said Abad mosque, used by the minority Shia Muslim community.\nMore than 100 people were injured in the blast in the northern city.\nThe Islamic State group said it was behind the attack. Sunni Muslim extremists have targeted Shias who they see as heretics.\nIS-K, the Afghan regional affiliate of the IS group that is violently opposed to the governing Taliban, has carried out several bombings recently, largely in the east of the country.\nAn IS suicide bomber reportedly detonated an explosive vest as worshippers gathered inside the mosque for Friday prayers. \nZalmai Alokzai, a local businessman who rushed to a hospital to check whether doctors needed blood donations, described seeing chaotic scenes after the attack.\n\"Ambulances were going back to the incident scene to carry the dead,\" he told AFP news agency. \nLocal security officials were quoted by Tolo News as saying that more than 300 people were attending the prayers when the attack happened.\nThere are fears that the death toll will rise further.\nThe United Nations said Friday's bombing was a \"third deadly attack this week apparently targeting a religious institution\" and was part of a \"disturbing pattern of violence\". \nThe UN referred to Sunday's bombing near a mosque in the capital Kabul that left several people dead, and an assault on a madrassa (educational institution) in the eastern city of Khost on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile the US said diplomats would on Saturday hold the first in-person talks with Taliban leaders since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. \nDuring the two days of meetings the US would press the Taliban to respect women's rights, form an inclusive government and allow humanitarian agencies to operate, a state department spokesperson said.\nIS-K, the group that targeted Kabul airport in a devastating bombing in August, has repeatedly targeted Afghanistan's Shia minority in the past. Suicide bombers have struck mosques, sports clubs and schools. In recent weeks, IS has also stepped up a campaign of attacks against the Taliban.\nIS targeted a funeral prayer service attended by a number of senior Taliban leaders in Kabul on Sunday, and there have been a spate of smaller attacks in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar, where IS previously had its stronghold.\nFriday's attack, if it has been carried out by IS as they claim, would mark a grim expansion of their activities into the north of the country. The Taliban say they have arrested dozens of members of IS and are believed to have killed others suspected of links to the group, but publicly they have also played down the threat IS poses. \nMany Afghans hoped that the Taliban's takeover would at least herald a more peaceful, if authoritarian, era. But IS represents a significant threat to the Taliban's promise of improved security. \nThe Taliban took control of Afghanistan after foreign forces withdrew from the country at the end of August following a deal agreed with the US.\nIt came two decades after US forces had removed the militants from power in 2001."

      "text": "More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity.\nEnergy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas.\nNational Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty.\nHouseholds that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty.\nAt the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account.\nBut Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up.\nAnalysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between \u00a3400 and \u00a3600 more per year. \nHouseholds in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.\nIf you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company.\nNormally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now.\nUntil recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available.\nThe cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase.\nSo for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nNational Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty.\n\"It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by \u00a3400 to \u00a3600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,\" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer.\nNEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households.\nOfgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April. \nIts chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was \"designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time\".\nNatural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. \nAs a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it.\nEven with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties.\n\"Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,\" he told an energy conference on Thursday.\nNine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers.\nThose households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy.\nThe government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he said.\nDecarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said. \n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nHowever, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term.\nThe next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April.\nAnalysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by \u00a3400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around \u00a31,660 a year.\nHowever the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nBusinesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead to higher prices for their goods as increases are passed on to consumers.\nRichard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now \"inevitable\".\n\"The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases.\"\nMark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture. \nThe past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about \u00a3500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand.\n\"It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,\" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster. \n\"Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was \u00a38,000 - it was a shock.\n\"We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down.\" \nThe energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas.\nWhen the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThat is a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by \u00a384, to \u00a31,042.\nWill you be affected by rising energy prices?

But, as winter fast approaches, how worried should we be?\nThe rates certainly look troubling. Only a handful of countries, including Romania and Serbia, have higher infection levels than the UK. And compared with the big nations in western Europe, the numbers are significantly higher.\nThere is a variety of reasons for this. The UK - or rather England - was the first nation in Europe to fully unlock when it ended most Covid restrictions on 19 July. It was not until late August that an EU country - Denmark - followed suit.\nOthers, such as Norway, have only taken this step in recent weeks, while many have retained a significant number of measures, such as limits on large gatherings, Covid passports to enter bars and restaurants, social distancing and mandatory mask-wearing.\nFor example, in Germany and Italy there are still restrictions on large crowds at events like football matches. And in a number of nations, such as Spain, social distancing remains in schools as does wearing masks from the age of six. \nSo it is hardly surprising a virus that thrives on human contact has taken off in the UK compared with the rest of Europe.\nAnother factor is vaccination. At the start of the year and into the spring, the UK was leading the way on vaccination. But not any more, with the likes of Spain, Portugal and France all having administered more doses per head of population.\nA big reason for this is that many nations have started vaccinating under-16s, whereas this is only just getting going in the UK.\nBut when it comes to protecting people from serious illness - older people and those with health conditions - the UK has similar high levels of vaccine uptake. \nAnd that protection means the gap in the numbers dying is much smaller.\nThere are currently just over 100 deaths a day on average linked to Covid. That may sound a lot, but it is similar to what happens in a bad flu season for months on end.\nOf course, death should not be the only measure. Every day there are about 700 people being admitted into hospital with Covid. For some, the road to recovery will be long and arduous.\nThere is also then the risk of \"long Covid\" among those who have not become severely ill. The idea of persistent symptoms after a viral infection is not unique to Covid - it also happens with flu. But given we are still learning about Covid and it appears to happen more often, there are some who argue this warrants more action to contain spread.\nProf Christina Pagel and Prof Martin McKee, both of whom are members of Independent Sage, a self-appointed group of experts which has been critical of the approach taken by the government, wrote in the Guardian this week about the benefits of the \"vaccine-plus\" approaches taken on mainland Europe.\nBut extra measures do come with a cost, so for others it comes back to trade-offs. Prof Mike Tildesley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, believes there needs to be a debate about what is an \"acceptable\" level of Covid or we could find ourselves relying on extra measures long-term. \"Covid is here to stay - we need to discuss what we are willing to live with.\"\nBut it is not just where we are at, it's where we are heading that matters. There has always been variation in rates across Europe as a result of different approaches and being at different stages of the pandemic. \nThe UK was hit by the more infectious variants Alpha and then Delta before other parts of Europe. Back in early spring, for example, the UK had one of the lowest rates in Europe because our Alpha wave had passed and Europe's was in full swing. \nWith Covid the situation can change quickly. And as the chart on deaths above illustrates, this may already be happening. The UK death rate is falling - an achievement in itself given how open society is and a sign that the virus has been brought under some control. If nothing else really rapid surges in infection should be a thing of the past because of the amount of immunity in the population most experts agree.\nThe epidemic here is largely being fuelled by high rates in teenagers - and, in particular, those under the age of 16 who have not had a chance to get vaccinated over the summer, unlike many of their peers elsewhere in Europe.\nChildren are, of course, at very low risk of serious illness. So the concern has always been that infections in the young could spread into older age groups.\nBut the early signs are that that is not happening - and the rise in children may have peaked. Prof Tildesley says he is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the data although he says it is quite possible rates in teenagers will remain high for a little while.\nWhen this wave in teenagers ends, through a combination of natural immunity and the vaccination programme that is clicking into gear, we could actually start to see a sustained fall in infections as winter approaches.\nThat, after all, was always the argument the government and its senior scientists - Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance - made when they decided to unlock on 19 July - that is was better to have our \"exit wave\" before winter really hit. \nProf Neil Ferguson, one of the senior scientists advising ministers, said this week there was a lot of uncertainty about what would happen next, but a sustained decline from this point on was possible. \"It's not guaranteed we will see a winter wave,\" he told MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus. \nBut the problem, he said, was there was \"limited headroom\" in the NHS to cope with even a little surge. And that is one of the big risks with the government's approach.\nThe NHS has, compared with other nations, much less capacity to absorb extra demand. \nAnd this winter that will not just come from Covid. Lockdowns and social distancing meant the traditional winter viruses were largely absent last year. That will have led to less immunity across the population, prompting fears they could rebound back in a big way.\nA virus called RSV, which can cause 30,000 admissions every winter among the under-fives - six times what we have seen so far in that age group from Covid - is already circulating at very high levels. The flu season is just beginning.\nIt will not take much for the situation to unravel.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The public are being reminded to come forward for their flu jab to maximise their protection ahead of winter.\nHealth officials are worried because this will be the first winter Covid and flu circulate fully at the same time.\nResearch shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone.\nMore than 40 million people across the UK - 35 million in England - are being offered a jab this year in the biggest flu vaccination campaign so far.\nAnd this includes, for the first time, all secondary-school children up to the age of 16.\nAlongside the extended flu campaign, the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions are also being offered a Covid booster jab this autumn and winter.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the newly formed UK Health Security Agency, warned the level of immunity to flu was likely to be lower this winter because very little of the virus had been circulating last year, because of social distancing and lockdown.\n\"It is really important people get vaccinated,\" she said.\n\"This is the first winter where we will have seasonal flu and Covid co-circulating.\"  \nProf Wendy Barclay, professor of virology at Imperial College London, told the BBC's Today Programme that it had been trickier to gauge which flu strains to cover with this year's vaccine because cases had been so low last year. \n\"The vaccine this year is updated to match what we predict will be the circulating strains,\" she said.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said \"we need to take this seriously and defend ourselves\" by taking the vaccines when offered.\n\"Both these viruses are serious: they can both spread easily, cause hospitalisation and they can both be fatal,\" he said.\nFlu kills about 11,000 people on average every winter in England and during the last bad flu winter of 2017-18 the toll was more than double that - with more than 300 deaths a day during the peak.\nFlu and the other winter viruses also lead to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day in winter months - more, currently, than is being seen for Covid.\nAnd this winter, respiratory illness could hit very high levels, causing severe strain on the NHS and up to 60,000 deaths, according to a report from the Academy of Medical Sciences.\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of hospital admission in the under-fives, is already circulating at much higher levels than normal. \nThe winter warning comes as the government launches an advertising campaign, featuring TV medics Dr Amir Khan, Dr Dawn Harper and Dr Karan Ranj, to encourage those eligible to come forward for both the flu and Covid boosters.\nThe following groups are among those eligible for winter vaccines:\nGP surgeries will contact patients eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine or eligible patients can book an appointment at a pharmacy.\nPeople who qualify for the coronavirus booster are being told to wait until they are contacted.\nAnyone who is not eligible for a free flu jab can pay for it privately at many pharmacies, at a cost of about \u00a315.\nWhat questions do you have about the flu vaccine?"

      "text": "Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the \"nicest, kindest\" colleague.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him \"a thoroughly decent man\".\nMr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year.\nHe died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated.\nAn MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson.\nHouse of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark \"a profound loss to us all\".\nMrs May tweeted: \"Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend.\"\nAnd Mr Johnson tweeted that it was \"desperately sad\", adding: \"James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective.\"\nMr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary.\nHe lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street.\nMr Brokenshire re-entered government as a Home Office minister in February last year, but stood down in July this year, due to poor health.\nFollowing his death, Mr Brokenshire's family expressed \"deep sadness\", adding: \"James was not only a brilliant government minister... but a dedicated constituency MP.\n\"But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many.\"\nThe family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire \"with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years\".\nThey also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers.\n\"In the last few years of his life James's passion was to help others with lung cancer, preventing others going through what he did,\" the memorial page said, describing him as an \"indefatigable campaigner for better lung cancer screening\".\nAfter his lung cancer diagnosis, Mr Brokenshire, a former lawyer, worked to promote greater awareness of the disease, urging people who showed symptoms to get tested.\nFellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her \"understated\" friend's death was \"heartbreaking\", adding: \"I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about.\n\"My thoughts are with Cathy and the family, who are just the most wonderful family. I'm devastated.\"\nSir Keir Starmer tweeted: \"James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held.\n\"He fought his illness with dignity and bravery. I'm incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children.\"\nThe UK's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, said: \"I had the personal privilege of working with him closely over a number of years and admired greatly his unwavering commitment to public service and compassion.\"\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, tweeted: \"So sorry to hear of the death of James Brokenshire, whose courage and faith were an inspiration to so many, myself included.\" \nBefore becoming the Old Bexley & Sidcup MP in 2010, Mr Brokenshire represented the seat of Hornchurch and Rainham, north-east London, for five years.\nHis death will prompt a Parliamentary by-election in Old Bexley and Sidcup, where he had a majority of 18,952 at the last general election."
