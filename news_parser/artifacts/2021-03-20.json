      "text": "A teacher and ex-Royal Marine said his family is lucky to be alive after a suspected arson attack which destroyed their home in County Durham.\nSean Ivey, from Wingate, fled to safety with his wife and two children after a fire broke out early on Thursday. \nMr Ivey, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, believed he was targeted after standing up to anti-social behaviour.\nTwo men have been arrested and Durham Police issued a 48-hour dispersal order in the area.\n\"I just woke up in bed and felt the need to look out of the window,\" Mr Ivey said.\n\"I shouted to my wife that the car was on fire, go and get the kids.\"\nIt broke out around 01:45 GMT. Flames from the car then spread to a caravan parked on the driveway, before spreading to the roof of the bungalow.\nA second fire broke out during the early hours of Friday. Nobody was inside at the time.\nDurham Police are treating them as suspected arson.\nMr Ivey, who served with 45 Commando, said young people had been spotted riding around the area on quad bikes wearing balaclavas, \"terrorising\" other road users.\n\"[There have been] burglaries, car fires, this is quite extreme but these aren't isolated incidents,\" he added.\n\"I'm just absolutely fed up of the anti-social behaviour, the lack of respect, the lack of discipline, and where does it stop?\"\nOn Wednesday, hours before the first fire, Mr Ivey posted on social media that his parents had been robbed when four men burst into their home.\nHe said he had a run-in last weekend with a young biker \"riding like a lunatic\" and saw another in the main street of the former mining village pulling wheelies and mounting the paths.\nHe also called out gangs gathering outside a local takeaway.\nA fundraising campaign has raised more than \u00a350,000 to help the family, whose home was not insured because a policy had run out.\nPhotographs, medals and Mr Ivey's Royal Marines uniform have also been lost.\nTwo men, aged 22 and 25, have been arrested. Police said they were continuing to carry out lines of inquiry in relation to the second fire.\nInsp Emma Kay said it had had \"a huge impact\" on the family and the wider community. \n\"I would encourage anyone with information no matter how small it may be to come forward and help us bring the offenders to justice,\" she said.\nPatrols are being increased and the dispersal order will be in place over the weekend, meaning anyone failing to leave when asked will face arrest.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "Thousands of people have attended anti-lockdown demonstrations in London, after MPs urged the government to allow peaceful protest during lockdown.\nCrowds marched from Hyde Park to Westminster, with at least 33 arrests by police, mostly for Covid breaches.\nScotland Yard said the number of people attending Saturday's demonstrations exceeded expectations.\nThe Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend protests under the current coronavirus rules.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told the BBC more people than previously expected were at Saturday's protests, but the Met has not given a formal estimate of the number in attendance.\nBBC correspondent Marianna Spring, reporting from the anti-lockdown protests, said the atmosphere was \"animated\" and a number of people appeared to be angry about restrictions on peaceful protest.\nLater, in Hyde Park, police officers were forced to run back to their vans, as protesters threw bottles and cans at them.\nPA Media reported that some members of the public then left the park, with small children carried by their parents.\nThe anti-lockdown protests came after a vigil following the death of Sarah Everard in south London last week resulted in arrests, as police enforced Covid and public order laws.\nEarlier, more than 60 MPs and peers wrote to the home secretary calling for laws to be changed to allow peaceful protests during lockdown.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey blamed the scenes at the Clapham event on a lack of clarity putting police \"in an impossible position\", adding that the right to protest was a \"basic freedom\".\nBy Jon Donnison, news correspondent \nThousands of tightly-packed anti-lockdown protesters marched up Whitehall with some chanting \"freedom\" to the beat of a drum. \nOne man carried a placard bearing the words \"no more NHS and Gov lies\".\nI have seen very few demonstrators wearing masks and there's no attempt at social distancing. So far the police - who are here in large numbers - have been taking a hands-off approach, though I have seen at least one arrest on Whitehall.\nAmong the crowd there are undoubtedly some conspiracy theorists, with some accusing the mainstream media of pushing fake news. But that is by no means everyone here. \nOne woman, who did not want to be named, told me she knew Covid was bad. \"I had it myself last March,\" she said. \"But this lockdown is too much.\"\nThe letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch, urged her to issue guidance to police forces on \"facilitating\" protests.\nThe initial organisers of the Sarah Everard vigil effectively lost a High Court battle to hold it lawfully the day before, resulting in its cancellation.\nBut hundreds attended Clapham Common to gather around tributes left on a bandstand - the Met Police said the gathering became unlawful after people began delivering speeches to the crowd.\nThe event also increased interest in plans to give officers more precise powers to restrict demonstrations in a new sweeping Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill debated by MPs.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, told MPs earlier this month that protests elsewhere had not resulted in a spike in infections and that outdoor gatherings were safer than indoors, though not risk free.\nHe said: \"It is the case that it is difficult to see how things like large beach gatherings and so on can cause a spike. The same was the case in a protest march in New York; they did not really see any spikes after that. \n\"It is lower risk, but the other thing that can happen with outdoor events, and so on, is that, when indoor things are also open, you start to get people congregating indoors around that. That can increase risk, but outdoors itself is lower risk.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Friday was a record day for Covid vaccinations in the UK, with a combined 711,156 first and second doses given to members of the public.\nIt means that half of all UK adults - some 26,853,407 people - have now received a first dose of a vaccine.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the latest milestone in the rollout marked a \"phenomenal achievement\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson - one of those to receive a first dose on Friday - also hailed the landmark.\nA total of 2,132,551 people have also received their second dose of a vaccine, government figures show.\nAnother 96 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been recorded in the UK, as have a further 5,587 cases.\n\"Vaccinating over half of all adults is a phenomenal achievement and is testament to the mammoth efforts of the NHS, GPs, volunteers, local authorities and civil servants in every corner of the UK,\" said Mr Hancock.\nThe news comes after the government confirmed a shipment of about five million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab would be delayed, resulting in an expected reduction in the number of first doses - including for the under-50s - given during April.\nMeanwhile, European countries, including France, Germany and Italy, have begun offering the Oxford jab again after a pause over safety fears.\nMr Hancock said he was \"absolutely delighted\" to reveal the UK had reached the vaccination milestone.\nHe added: \"It's a huge success and I want to say many, many thanks to all those involved, including the half of all adults who have come forward.\"\nMr Johnson - who received his first dose on Friday - added he was \"immensely proud of the progress we have made so far in rolling out vaccinations\".\n\"There is still further to go and I encourage everyone to take up the offer when asked to do so,\" he said.\nDespite the progress of the UK's vaccine rollout, a scientist advising the government has warned overseas holidays would be \"extremely unlikely\" because of the risk of travellers bringing Covid variants back to the UK.\nThe UK faced a \"real risk\" if people travelled abroad in the summer, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into Sage, said.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was \"too early to tell\" when holidays abroad would be allowed.\nUnder the current roadmap for easing restrictions, the earliest date people in England could holiday abroad would be 17 May.\nWith all over-50s now able to take up the offer of a vaccine dose, the vaccination programme approaches a target to offer a vaccine to the top nine priority groups, as determined by scientific advisers, by mid-April.\nThese included frontline health and care workers, people who were clinically vulnerable and those with an increased risk of hospitalisation - covering 99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19.\nIn Northern Ireland and some areas of Scotland, people in their 50s were already being offered a Covid vaccine. Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April.\nThe most-recent issues with supplies meant the vaccine rollout would be \"slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves\", Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Friday.\nThose with appointments for second doses should attend as normal and it is expected April could see more second doses than first doses for the first time.\nAlongside the Oxford vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the UK has also approved a third vaccine - from Moderna - which is due to start being rolled out in late spring.\nA vaccine from Novavax has shown promising results and will be made in north-east England, and a single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson has also been shown to be effective."

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus vaccines,Poland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "France and Poland have reintroduced partial lockdowns as both countries battle a sharp rise in Covid infections in recent weeks.\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France, including the capital Paris, are affected as the country fears a third wave.\nIn Poland, non-essential shops, hotels, cultural and sporting facilities are now closed for three weeks.\nThe country has the highest new daily rates of Covid cases since November.\nCoronavirus cases are also rising exponentially in Germany, with Chancellor Angela Merkel warning it is likely that the country will now need to apply an \"emergency brake\" and re-impose lockdown measures.\nThe vaccine rollout across the European Union has been hindered by delayed deliveries, as well as the suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, over fears of possible side effects.\nMeanwhile demonstrations against coronavirus restrictions have affected several European cities.\nIn Amsterdam, police fired water cannon to clear protesters from Museum Square, a frequent venue for unauthorised demonstrations. Online footage showed a police dog handler prodding a woman in the chest with his baton and twice hitting a man who tried to protect her. \nAnd in the central German city of Kassel, police said they used pepper spray and batons to disperse demonstrators who tried to break through a cordon. Video footage posted on social media showed water cannon also being deployed.\n\"This is not what a peaceful protest looks like,\" police tweeted (in German).\nProtesters were also detained during an anti-lockdown protest in Hyde Park, London, and several thousand people gathered to protest against Covid restrictions in the small Swiss town of Liestal, near Basel.\nDemonstrations were also reported in Berlin, Helsinki and Vienna.\nIn France, the partial lockdown took effect from midnight on Friday.\nTrains leaving Paris for parts of the country where lockdown restrictions do not apply, such as Brittany and Lyon, were reportedly fully booked hours before the measures were due to come into effect. \nTraffic jams were reported on several roads leaving the capital.\nThe new restrictions are not be as strict as the previous lockdown, with people allowed to exercise outdoors.\nNon-essential businesses are shut, but schools remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a \"particular sanitary protocol\".\nFrance has reported more than 4.2 million infections since the start of the outbreak, with nearly 92,000 Covid-related deaths, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University in the US.\nThe new lockdown measures are set to last at least four weeks. Paris and its surrounding region, the area around Nice and large parts of northern France are all affected.\nIt is a lighter lockdown than the two previous ones, with the main difference being that during the day people can go outside for exercise for as long as they like. Schools are also staying open.  \nBut leaving the city for the countryside is not allowed, and yesterday there was heavy congestion on the roads and the trains as some Parisians got out while they could to non-lockdown zones.  \nMany in France find the bureaucratic approach of the government annoying, if predictable. \nThe rules on the high street are also opaque. While clothes and DIY shops are shut, hairdressers, bookshops, cobblers and florists are open.\nIn Poland, the three-week lockdown began on Saturday. \nPolish health officials earlier warned the nationwide restrictions were necessary because of a rampant British variant of Covid-19 in the country. The variant now makes up more than 60% of infections.\nPoland has had more than two million confirmed infections, and nearly 49,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nGermany said on Friday it was now classifying neighbouring Poland as high risk. This means that from Sunday anyone crossing the border from Poland must provide a negative coronavirus test. \nDespite assurances from the European medicines regulator that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective, some countries remain reluctant to resume their campaigns using the jab. \nGermany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands are among the countries that have restarted their AstraZeneca vaccination campaigns. \nHealth authorities in France have recommended that the vaccine be offered only to people aged 55 and over. \nFinland's health authority has announced a pause in its use of the vaccine that will last at least a week. That move, which follows two reports of blood clots in patients who had received the jab in the country, was said to be a precautionary measure. \nMeanwhile, Sweden, Denmark and Norway said on Friday that they needed more time to determine whether they should resume AstraZeneca inoculations. \nOn Saturday, Denmark said that two members of hospital staff in Copenhagen had developed blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has reviewed the vaccine over fears of a link to blood clots and found the jab was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of clots.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also urged countries to continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nOn Friday, experts at the WHO said the vaccine had \"tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world\". \nProfessor Sir John Bell, from the UK government's vaccine taskforce, said France's refusal to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s was \"really damaging people's confidence in vaccines generally\".\n\"It doesn't make any sense, the whole thing looks completely crackers,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\n\"If there are clotting problems associated with the vaccines - I am not saying there are, but if there were - they are at a very tiny level compared with the problems you get if you get the disease. If you want to die of a clot, get Covid.\" "

The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "text": "A probationary police officer who assaulted a woman in a \"terrifying\" attack has been given a curfew, prompting criticism he was not jailed.\nWest Midlands Police PC Oliver Banfield grabbed and manhandled Emma Homer last July while drunk. He has been suspended and faces disciplinary action.\nThe investigating force has apologised for delays in the prosecution.\nLabour MP Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Must have been terrifying for her... but no prison sentence.\"\nMs Homer said the attack had left her with \"anxiety, insomnia and stress\" and her family said they were \"disappointed\" with 25-year-old Banfield's sentence, a night-time curfew.\nDuring the sentencing hearing at Leicester Magistrates' Court, CCTV was shown in which Banfield could be seen shouting at Ms Homer.\nHe is seen grabbing her and forcing her to the floor during the assault in the early hours of 26 July in Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire.\nIn her victim personal statement which was read out in court, she said she thought he was \"fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy\". \nDescribing the assault, Ms Homer, 37, said: \"I often ask myself if the impact of the attack would have been so severe if my assailant was not a police officer.\n\"During the assault as I struggled to get to safety, I was sure this drunk man was fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy.\n\"To be verbally abused with misogynistic slang, grabbed by the neck, and forced to the floor on a dark road by a drunk man a foot taller than me is terrifying, but to then find that he was a police officer shook my belief system to its core.\"\nShe said: \"I considered myself a confident, relaxed, and independent wife and mother, but since the attack I live with constant anxiety.\n\"I have changed simple things like my route home, and I have had to ask my family not to discuss the case as it sends me into a panic attack - indeed whenever the subject is brought up I feel a rush of anxiety and a tightening at my throat.\"\nWarwickshire Police said it had personally apologised to Ms Homer for delays in the investigation. \nInitially the CPS said there was not enough evidence to bring a prosecution. But after Ms Homer appealed, further inquiries were made and Banfield was charged. \nWarwickshire's Chief Superintendent Ben Smith said the force recognised \"the strength of feeling that has come about as a result of Sarah Everard's tragic death and understand the concerns relating to violence against women and girls nationally\".\nAnd he added: \"We acknowledge that, due to internal process errors, the initial response to the report of the assault was not as swift as it should have been and an apology has been issued with regards to this.\"\nBanfield pleaded guilty to assault by beating at a hearing in January and at Friday's hearing received a 14-week curfew order banning him from leaving his house between 19:00 and 07:00. He was also ordered to pay his victim \u00a3500 compensation as well as a victim surcharge and court costs.\nMs Homer's family said a night-time curfew during lockdown was \"not really a punishment at all\".\nCriticising the non-custodial sentence in a tweet, Ms Harman wrote: \"He continues in post. WMPolice (West Midlands Police) must review.\n\"This is proof, if any needed, that system fails women and protects men.\"\nIn a statement, West Midlands Police said Banfield, of Bidford-on-Avon, had been suspended from duty and would now face charges of gross misconduct. \nDeputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine said: \"Our role is to protect the public, who should be able to trust us. We therefore hold all our officers to the highest standards and we will take appropriate action against anyone whose actions fall below what is expected.\" \nThe West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said he had asked Chief Constable Sir David Thompson to brief him on steps taken by the force.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "The prime minister has received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and has urged the public to do the same, saying he \"did not feel a thing\". \nBoris Johnson was given the vaccine at St Thomas' Hospital in central London, where he was treated for Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. \nAfter being vaccinated, the PM said: \"I cannot recommend it too highly\".  \nIt comes as several European countries said they would resume using the jab.\nLeaving hospital, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"I literally did not feel a thing. It was very good, very quick - I cannot recommend it too highly. \n\"Everybody, when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else.\"\nMore than 26 million people have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, according to the latest government figures. About two million people have had a second dose.\nIn England, 22,337,590 people had been given a first jab as of 18 March, according to NHS England,  the equivalent of 50.5% of the population aged 18 and over.\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi also received his vaccination at a pharmacy in Lewisham, south-east London, earlier.\nMeanwhile countries including France, Germany and Italy began restarting their vaccine programmes with the AstraZeneca jab - reversing earlier decisions to suspend them over blood clot concerns.\nThe resumption of the use of the vaccine comes after the European Medicines Agency confirmed it was \"safe and effective\".\nThe regulator reviewed the jab over fears about blood clots, but said it was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of such events, and that the benefits outweighed any risks.\nThe World Health Organization and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency have said the jab is safe and have encouraged people to take up their vaccine appointments. \nThe WHO's advisory committee on vaccine safety issued a statement on Friday saying the vaccine \"continues to have a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world\".\nOn Thursday, the prime minister reiterated that the jab was safe and urged people to take the vaccine if they were offered it. \nHe said: \"The thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it's so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes.\"\nHe also insisted that delays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April would not affect people getting their second doses, or England's road map out of lockdown. \n\"The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,\" he said. \nIn other developments, ONS figures suggest infection levels have continued to fall across England and Wales but have \"levelled off\" in Northern Ireland and increased in Scotland.\nAn estimated one in 335 people in the UK had Covid-19 in the week to 13 March, according to the figures, down from one in 280 last week.\nOn Friday, the UK reported a further 101 deaths and 4,802 cases, according to the government's separate daily coronavirus figures.

      "tags": "Robert Jenrick,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Seaside towns,Retailing,UK economy,Shopping,Pubs,Bournemouth,UK High Streets",
      "text": "All coastal towns in England will be eligible for government funding to help them reopen as restrictions are eased, under new plans set out by ministers.\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the \u00a356m fund would also \"spruce up\" high streets and help councils welcome visitors back safely.\nPubs can put up marquees in their gardens for longer and there will be a crackdown on \"cowboy parking firms\". \nLabour said it was a \"drop in the ocean\" in terms of what areas needed.\nEngland's current \"stay at home\" regulations are expected to be lifted on 29 March, with most restrictions eased in various steps by the 21 June, based on certain conditions being met at each stage. \nAnnouncing the latest tranche of funding, Mr Jenrick acknowledged it had been \"an incredibly difficult period for retail and hospitality\".\nHe said the government would do everything it could to help businesses reopen safely. \nThere has been concern about how coastal areas in particular will cope with an expected influx of visitors. \nWhen the first lockdown was eased last June, seaside resorts were gridlocked, with Bournemouth declaring a \"major incident\" as people flocked to the beach.\nMr Jenrick said that this time, \u00a36m of the \u00a356m Welcome Back fund would be specifically allocated to support coastal areas.\nThe remaining \u00a350m will be distributed by central government to councils for things such as improving green spaces and providing more outdoor seating areas, markets and food pop-ups. \nHe also announced the government would be \"cutting red tape\" to allow pubs to erect marquees in their gardens for \"the whole of the spring and summer\", rather than the 28 days currently permitted, so people can meet up with their family and friends \"whatever the weather\".\nAnd in a bid to attract more shoppers to the high street, ministers have announced a crackdown on cowboy parking firms. \nThere will be a new appeals process to try to curb unfair tickets and caps will be introduced on private parking fines.\nThe struggles of the hospitality sector amid multiple lockdowns have been well documented. And the independent retailers' trade body Bira says the past 12 months have been the worst of its members' lives -  with crucial in-person Easter and pre-Christmas trade lost.\nOnce non-essential shops can open again, from 12 April in England, any help to attract people back will no doubt be welcome. Businesses will want to make the most of pent-up demand in a safe way.\nThe same goes for hospitality. While social distancing will still be in place at least to start with, maximising outdoor space will be crucial for venues which have it - especially during the first phase of their reopening when only outdoor service will be permitted.\nPackages like these for high streets and towns won't fix the long-term challenges facing town centres: shoppers going online, leaving big high street stores increasingly empty. Some customers have grown so used to internet shopping during a year of lockdowns that the habit will stick. \nThe hope will be, however, to make this a summer to remember after a winter to forget. \nGovernment officials say this will \"give drivers more confidence in heading into town knowing they won't be unfairly penalised by rogue operators\". \nMr Jenrick said: \"As we move to the next stage on the road map out of lockdown, we are all looking forward to being reunited with friends and family outdoors and making a safe and happy return to our favourite shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants. \n\"Our Welcome Back Fund gives every city, town and high street support to prepare for a great summer. This funding will help councils and businesses to welcome shoppers, diners and tourists back safely. \n\"As soon as the road map allows, we need to get behind our local businesses and enjoy all that this country has to offer and that we've been missing so much.\"\nBut Labour has accused the Conservatives of presiding over \"decades of decline\". \nThe shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said: \"This is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much the Conservatives took away over a decade when they pushed our high streets and seaside towns into deep decline - and it's not clear which areas will benefit.\n\"The Conservatives have done nothing to level the playing field between high street shops and online retailers.  Now they want to hollow high streets out by selling off temporarily closed shops to wealthy developers so they can never reopen as shops again. \""

They are urging people not to travel and to limit gatherings to immediate family.\nJust 8% of Germany's population has so far received a first dose of vaccine, although the government on Friday resumed the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. \nVice-president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, Lars Schaade, warned of the possibility of \"many severe cases and deaths, and hospitals that are overwhelmed\".\nThe RKI has said that cases in Germany are rising at a \"very clearly exponential rate\". \nDespite assurances from the European medicines regulator that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective, some countries remain reluctant to resume their campaigns using the jab. \nFinland's health authority has announced a pause in its use of the vaccine that will last at least a week. \nThe move, which follows two reports of blood clots in patients who had received the jab in the country, was said to be a precautionary measure. \nMeanwhile, Sweden, Denmark and Norway said on Friday that they needed more time to determine whether they should resume AstraZeneca inoculations. \nGermany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands are among the countries that have restarted their AstraZeneca vaccination campaigns. \nHealth authorities in France have recommended that the vaccine be offered only to people aged 55 and over. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed the jab after 13 European countries suspended use of the vaccine over fears of a link to blood clots.\nIt found the jab was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of clots.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nOn Friday, experts at the WHO said the vaccine had \"tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world\". \n\"The available data do not suggest any overall increase in clotting conditions such as deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following administration of Covid-19 vaccines,\" the WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said in a statement.\nOther European leaders have sought to reassure citizens that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is safe.\nItaly's Prime Minister Mario Draghi, 73, said he would happily have the vaccine, but that he had \"not yet made a booking\".\nHis French counterpart, 55-year-old Jean Castex, received an AstraZeneca dose on Friday.\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also received his first dose of the vaccine.\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France, including the capital Paris, will be placed under Covid lockdown measures from midnight on Friday as the country fears a third wave.\nTrains leaving Paris for parts of the country where lockdown restrictions do not apply, such as Brittany and Lyon, were reportedly fully booked hours before the measures were due to come into effect. Traffic jams were reported on several roads leaving the capital. \nIn Poland, coronavirus cases are continuing to surge with new daily infections reaching levels not seen since the second wave peaked in November. \nA three-week partial lockdown is being introduced on Saturday to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. Shops, hotels, cultural and sporting facilities will close across the country. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Sarah Everard murder,Priti Patel",
      "text": "More than 60 MPs and peers have written to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid-19 legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown. \nThe letter, organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch, says there is a human right to protest. \nUnder England's current lockdown regulations, protests are not listed as a \"reasonable excuse\" for leaving home.\nIt comes as further protests are planned for Saturday by anti-lockdown campaigners.\nThe Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend protests at a time when regulations that are in place to prevent wide transmission of Covid require people to stay at home at all times, except for a limited number of exceptions.\nLast weekend, police were criticised for arresting women attending a vigil following the killing of Sarah Everard.  \nHome Secretary Priti Patel has instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to \"conduct a lessons-learned review into the policing of the event\".\nA day earlier, campaigners attempted, without success, to persuade the High Court that the vigil should be exempt from the coronavirus regulations.\nThe judge hearing the case decided not to intervene but did suggest that the human rights of expression and gathering might be considered reasonable excuses in some circumstances.\nThe letter to Ms Patel was signed by several Conservative MPs - including Steve Baker, and Sir Christopher Chope - as well as Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and a number of Labour MPs and peers.\nIt demands that the home secretary issue guidance to police forces on \"facilitating\" protests to clear up the legal confusion surrounding the issue. \nIt calls on Ms Patel to act in order to avoid a situation where organisers and the police have to \"decipher precisely what is required\". \n\"The absence of clear guidance on these issues has created an entirely unsatisfactory situation, which has persisted to varying degrees for almost a year now,\" the letter says.\n\"The police have no legal certainty as to their duties and powers, protestors have no legal certainty as to their rights, and there is inconsistent application of the Regulations across the country. This cannot continue,\" the letter adds. \nIn response, the Home Office maintained its position that it would be illegal to to leave home without a reasonable excuse until coronavirus rules change on 29 March. \nIt added: \"While we are still in a pandemic we continue to urge people to avoid mass gatherings, in line with wider coronavirus restrictions.\"\nReacting to reports of more protests planned this weekend, the Metropolitan Police said a \"significant policing operation\" would be in place throughout the day to \"engage\" with people who are in breach of the regulations.  \nIt added: \"Those gathering will be encouraged to return home.  If they do not they face necessary and proportionate enforcement action.  This could be a fixed penalty notice or arrest.\"\nThe legal confusion grew following last week's Court of Appeal case - during which the force appeared to accept that it did not have a policy of blanket bans on protests, because that would breach human rights. \nHowever, when those attending the vigil in memory of the 33-year-old marketing executive surrounded a bandstand on Clapham Common, a decision was taken to attempt to remove them.  \nThere were confrontations with the police and arrests were made.  \nSilkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, said: \"The harrowing scenes of police officers using force against women at Clapham Common recently were avoidable and wrong. Over the past week, many more demonstrators and even legal observers have been arrested or fined.\n\"This stain on our democracy is a direct consequence of this government's disrespect for the most basic of British democratic freedoms.\"\nSam Grant from Liberty said: \"Last week, the police conceded protest is not banned under the lockdown regulations, but used them to threaten then arrest demonstrators anyway. \n\"The home secretary must immediately issue guidance to all police forces to ensure socially distanced protests can go ahead and create an explicit exemption for protest in the current regulations.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Saturday morning. We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nAs a new wave of coronavirus sweeps across Europe, France and Poland have reintroduced partial lockdown measures to combat a sharp rise in infections. About 21 million people across 16 parts of France - including Paris - are affected by the restrictions, which came into force from midnight. In Poland, shops, hotels, cultural and sporting facilities will be shut for three weeks from Saturday. It comes after Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel warned it is likely the country will also have to re-impose lockdown measures.\nA cross-party group of more than 60 MPs and peers have written to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown. The letter co-ordinated by the campaign groups Big Brother Watch and Liberty says the current rules have been applied inconsistently and disregard the human right to protest. Demonstrations by anti-lockdown campaigners and women's safety groups are expected to take place later.\nWealthy states - including the UK, the US and the European Union - are blocking proposals to help developing nations ramp up their capabilities for manufacturing coronavirus vaccines, documents seen by BBC Newsnight. According to a leaked copy of the negotiating text of a World Health Organization resolution, richer nations have pushed back on provisions in international law that would enable the developing nations to achieve this. Experts have said that equitable access to vaccines is essential to prevent cases and deaths. The UK government highlighted its \"leading\" efforts to bring vaccines to developing countries.\nWhen Tyrone and Alina stole a kiss in Friday's episode of Coronation Street, many viewers will have been rightly left wondering how they filmed it following social distancing guidelines. The answer: real-life kissing doubles. Like most other shows, Coronation Street stopped filming during the first national lockdown in March 2020 and resumed filming in a restricted manner several months later.\nWales on Monday became the first UK nation to reopen its hairdressers - and a man stopped by police in England for speeding told officers he had gone there for a haircut.  Avon and Somerset Police clocked him driving at 122mph near Junction 23 of the M5 in Somerset. The 29-year-old was arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit through drugs. Current lockdown rules in England require people to stay at home unless it is for a number of permitted reasons such as exercise, outdoor recreation or work, but not haircuts.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nLockdown restrictions have begun to be eased across the UK.

      "text": "The Queen and Duchess of Cornwall have thanked volunteers for supporting people during the pandemic, saying they have been a \"great help\". \nThey took part in a video call to thank members of the Royal Voluntary Service to mark one year since it launched the NHS Volunteer Responders Scheme. \nThe Queen, patron of the RVS, said they had done \"wonderful work\", including delivering books to people. \nNearly one million volunteers have been recruited to the scheme. \nThey have helped with tasks such as picking up prescriptions and doing food shopping for those shielding and unable to leave their homes, as well as taking part in check-up calls. \n\"I think it's wonderful work,\" said the Queen. \"Thank you to everybody - and all the others too who have been volunteering. It has been a great help.\" \nOne of those on the call was retired police officer Tracy Clarke, who spoke about her work with the RVS Gateshead Home Library Service. She told them that the delivery of books had become a lifeline during the pandemic for those who loved reading. \nThe Queen said this must have been a great comfort and \"very helpful\", as \"books are very important to people\".\nCamilla, who is president of the RVS, told the volunteers: \"Thank you all very much for all you've done throughout the year, throughout the pandemic. We couldn't have done without you.\"\nRVS chief executive Catherine Johnstone, who hosted the call, told the Queen and duchess of her pride at how the UK had stepped forward to volunteer during the coronavirus pandemic. \nOne of the volunteers the royal pair spoke to was Anderson Akponeware, from Middlesbrough, who has also been studying for his PhD and home-schooling during the past year. \nHe told them: \"People have been living in their own small bubbles, and I wouldn't have known how isolated those small bubbles could be until I took on this role.\"\nMembers of the Royal Family, including Camilla, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex, have taken part in RVS \"check in and chat\" calls with those living alone or shielding during the pandemic. \nAhead of this week's call, Camilla said she had had \"lots of happy conversations\" with Doris Winfield, 86, who she met through the scheme and who died earlier this year. The pair were able to meet in person last year at the Royal Voluntary Service Lunch Club in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.  \nThe Duchess of Cambridge is in regular contact with 85-year-old Len Gardner from Batley, Yorkshire, who she first spoke to last May through the NHS Volunteer Responder scheme, while the Countess of Wessex has been speaking to 89-year-old Edna Farley from Liverpool every fortnight. \nThe Queen has been patron of the RVS since 1952, when it was known as the Women's Voluntary Service (WVS). \nMeanwhile, Clarence House has said Camilla and the Prince of Wales will travel to Greece next week for an official two-day visit.\nDuring their visit to Athens, arranged at the request of the government, they will attend Bicentenary Independence Day celebrations, a reception at the National Gallery of Greece, a wreath-laying ceremony and a traditional military parade."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "Bill Nelson, a US senator and one-time astronaut, has been nominated to be the next head of Nasa.\nThe 78-year-old is seen as a moderate Democrat, and his nomination by President Joe Biden on Friday drew bipartisan praise.\nHe will need to be confirmed in the Senate before he can take up the role.\nMr Nelson said he was \"honoured\" to be picked to lead the US space agency, adding that he would \"help lead Nasa into an exciting future\".\nIn a statement, the White House said he was \"known as the go-to senator for our nation's space programme\" for many years. \"Almost every piece of space and science law has had his imprint,\" it said.\nThe Republican Senator from Florida, Marco Rubio, said: \"I cannot think of anyone better to lead Nasa.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Nelson said Nasa's workforce \"radiates optimism, ingenuity and a can-do spirit.\" He added: \"The Nasa team continues to achieve the seemingly impossible as we venture into the cosmos.\"\nMr Nelson was a driving force behind Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which was conceived in the wake of an Obama-era overhaul of the US space programme.\nHe will succeed Jim Bridenstine, who led the agency for almost three years under the Trump administration. \nMr Bridenstine earned widespread praise for his efforts to promote Nasa programmes - in particular, its Artemis venture, which will see astronauts return to the Moon in the 2020s before mounting a mission to Mars.\n\"Bill Nelson is an excellent pick for Nasa Administrator,\" Mr Bridenstine said, adding that the former Florida senator had the \"political clout\" to collaborate with different government offices as well as members of Congress.\n\"He has the diplomatic skills to lead an international coalition sustainably to the Moon and on to Mars,\" he said. \"The Senate should confirm Bill Nelson without delay.\"\nMr Nelson was among those who initially criticised Mr Bridenstine's confirmation in 2018, saying: \"The administrator must be a leader who has the ability to bring us together... on a shared vision for future space exploration.\"\nThe Oklahoma Congressman had no formal qualifications in science and engineering, and there were concerns he would politicise the non-partisan agency.\nBut following Mr Bridenstine's successful tenure at Nasa, the Biden administration has opted to appoint another politician as the agency's head - albeit a former astronaut with a long history of working on space issues.\nMr Nelson served in Florida's state legislature during the 1970s, representing the district that's home to Nasa's Kennedy Space Center.\nAfter his election to the House of Representatives in 1978, he became the second sitting member of Congress to travel into space when he flew as a payload specialist aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1986.\nAfter he won election to the Senate in Florida in 2000, Mr Nelson continued to be closely involved in formulating space policy. \nIn 2010, he said he believed President Barack Obama had \"made a mistake\" by cancelling the Constellation programme. That programme was former President George W Bush's effort to return astronauts to the Moon.\nThe decision to axe Constellation - which, at the time, was over budget and behind schedule - sparked a backlash in Congress, not least because it jeopardised thousands of space jobs in southern states.\nAlong with a Republican Senator for Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mr Nelson insisted that Nasa be mandated to build a new heavy-lift rocket in the agency's 2010 Authorization Act. \nThe SLS gave Nasa the capability to launch its Orion crew vehicle to the Moon and other deep space destinations, while securing a base of engineering expertise across the south.\nBut the programme was criticised by those who believed the agency should move to launching spacecraft entirely on commercial rockets, like those built by Elon Musk's company SpaceX.\nMr Nelson lost his last re-election bid and his Senate term ended in 2019.\nIn a statement, the acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk, said: \"Bill has a proven history of supporting our work here at Nasa, and has helped advance America's position in human exploration, science, aeronautics, and technology.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "The Indian city of Mumbai is to roll out mandatory coronavirus tests in crowded places as the country grapples with a rise in infections.\nThe local government said rapid tests would be done randomly in areas such as shopping centres and train stations.\nA refusal to be tested will \"amount to an offence\", it said.\nIndia recorded 40,953 new Covid cases on Saturday, the biggest daily jump for nearly four months. A total 159,000 people have died with the disease.\nIt has seen more than 11.5 million cases of coronavirus infections so far - and the number has been steadily climbing for weeks as the country scrambles to vaccinate its population and identify highly contagious variants of the disease.\nIn Mumbai, a coronavirus hotspot in the western state of Maharashtra, 2,982 people have contracted the disease in the past 24 hours.\nThe rapid tests will be mandatory in crowded places such as shopping centres and train stations from 22 March, city officials said.\nThe commissioner of the local authority told India Today that people should \"be ready for the swab test\" whenever they enter a busy area in Mumbai. \nThe tests will be carried out for free - except those at shopping centres, where the costs will be covered by individuals. \nMumbai officials did not specify what action would be taken against those who refuse to have tests.\nThe local authority said it would use rapid antigen tests (RATs), a type of test that detects the presence of proteins unique to the coronavirus.\nBut research shows these tests are less reliable than other types and sometimes produce incorrect results.\nIndia has recorded the third-highest number of infections, and the fourth-highest number of deaths, of any country in the world.\nInfections started to dip at the start of 2021, but doctors have blamed a fresh wave on poor adherence to restrictions.\nIn recent weeks Maharashtra, which has long been a virus hotspot, has accounted for the majority of new infections.\nSeven other states - including Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh - are also reporting a resurgence of Covid-19.\nSome regions in India have brought back restrictions, including lockdowns and restaurant closures, while more are believed to be considering similar moves.\nWith the easing of restrictions and life returning to normal in the densely packed cities, Indians have been lax in following Covid-19 safety protocols.\nBut what is still unclear at the moment is whether new variants of the virus are responsible for the new infections. \nTwo variants are under investigation for possible links with the uptick in cases in a few states.\nMuch of the blame, however, should lie with the authorities, who many believe have been equally lax in enforcing Covid-19 measures.\nThe cricket board allowed tens of thousands of spectators, mostly unmasked, to pack a stadium for a match in western Ahmedabad city last week, even as infections were climbing.\nElsewhere, Covid-19 tests will reportedly not be required for thousands of pilgrims expected to take a holy dip at an upcoming Hindu religious festival in Uttarakhand state.\nIn this context, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for states to contain the spread of infections sounds disingenuous. There is a clear and present danger of India frittering away the \"advantage\" of bringing new infections down to lower levels in February.\nThe vaccination drive began in January in India, a country of more than 1.3 billion people. \nMore than 40 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine so far.\nThe rollout is currently targeting elderly people and those with underlying health conditions, but it is expected to expand further soon.\nThe government aims to use up to 500 million doses to cover 250 million \"priority people\" by the end of July.\nAlthough the pace of vaccination has picked up, experts say unless the drive is scaled up the target could be missed.\nPrime Minister Modi, 70, received a dose on 1 March. After receiving the jab, he urged people to take the vaccine when their turn comes."

      "tags": "Abertillery,Swansea,Morriston",
      "text": "Wedding businesses say there is \"no light at the end of the tunnel\" and are relying on personal savings to survive.\nCouples who have planned, cancelled, then re-planned their special day say they are hoping to say \"I do\" instead of \"what can I do?\" as lockdown eases.\nBut with no date set for wedding receptions, there remains confusion over whether plans for 2021 will fall foul of future guidelines.\nThe Welsh government said the law had changed to expand the range of venues.\nA week ago First Minister Mark Drakeford set out how various sectors in society would be reopened - like non-essential shops, hairdressers and outdoor sports - but weddings were not mentioned in his plans. \nOn Friday the Welsh government said as long as case rates remained low and vaccination numbers continued, weddings would be \"considered\" from 22 April.\nAt present receptions are banned and the number of ceremony guests depends on how many people from different households a venue can safely keep 2m apart.\nKris Agland, managing director of venue St Peter's Hall in Cardiff, said the guidance around weddings was \"being handled appallingly\" and called for more dialogue between the hospitality industry and those in power.\n\"There's no clear guidance. It's been a kind of one-size-fits-all approach,\" he said.\n\"Come and see what we're doing - do you feel safe? Why can't someone from the trade be part of their conversations?\"\nHe said he spent about \u00a310,000 making Covid-compliant additions to the venue, which usually hosts 50 to 60 wedding receptions each year.\n\"No-one will book anything until they know what the guidance is,\" he said.\n\"Everything is based on what-ifs. Financially as a business it's crippled it. Personally, it's just got me further and further into debt just like everybody else who owns hospitality businesses. \n\"When things do come back they're going to come back with such a boom that you've got to see yourselves through to that position. But at what stage do people say, 'well I can't see it through'?\"\nWedding photographer Mary Watler-Thomas, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said some ceremonies had been \"surreal\", including couples being told to wear masks during the ceremony.\n\"Last year I was set to cover 20 [weddings] but I had quite a few postponed so ended up doing 10. But this year I'm set to do 27, fingers crossed,\" she said.\n\"When people want to postpone they're worried they won't be able to have all their guests there, they want to postpone but I'm not available for their new date.\n\"Because they haven't given a date for hospitality [couples are] reducing the day to just the ceremony. I've had to reduce the time to two hours where I used to cover 12 hours so it's had a massive impact on income because you're reducing the day by 10 hours.\n\"There's been so much confusion... a lot of questions in the minds of those planning what it'll look like in Wales, so it would be very helpful to have a roadmap in Wales.\"\nClaire Vessey, 46, from Treboeth, Swansea, and her fianc\u00e9e David McQueen, 54, from Morriston, have been together for nine years and put off getting married while caring for Claire's elderly mum, Maureen.\nWhen Maureen, 86, died at the start of the first lockdown, the couple - who had previously had a blessing at the Sacred Heart church in Swansea - decided to make her dream come true.\n\"The wedding would be one thing she would want us to do,\" said Ms Vessey, an administration manager for fire protection services.\n\"Us being happy together, that's what she would have loved. \n\"We incorporated what she would want too, so we can feel like she's there. She loved butterflies so that's part of our theme. She's a massive part of the day.\"\nBut Covid restrictions meant the couple had to plan for various outcomes. They still have not confirmed their guest list.\n\"We booked it for 15 May. It has been so hard with all the restrictions and so many obstacles put in our way,\" said Ms Vessey.\n\"It's like we have been planning two weddings. One for original plans - church wedding with a late reception - and also back-up plans if restrictions do not lift, which is looking like what we will have to go with.\n\"But these plans are all still not confirmed. Everything is up in the air and the weeks are flying by - we never thought it would be so stressful.\"\nDespite the stress, the couple said there were benefits to keeping the wedding simple.\nMs Vessey said: \"When people planned weddings in the past, they planned this big wedding with all these people, but when you break it down it's about two people that really love each other. He's my first real boyfriend and my first love. \n\"It's about David and I now. We've concentrated on what's important for us two, which is what it's really about.\"\nIn Scotland, wedding receptions - but without alcohol - can take place with up to 50 people from 26 April.\nWedding ceremonies in Northern Ireland are currently limited to 25 people and receptions are banned. But dates for lockdown easing reviews are set for 15 April, 13 May and 10 June.\nFrom 29 March in England, weddings can be attended by a maximum of six people. This will rise to 15 after 12 April if Covid rates remain low, increasing to a limit of 30 after 17 May. Receptions are included in the plans, but only in certain venues.\nHelen Pembridge, who runs a bridal boutique in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, said many brides who had already had to cancel appointments three or four times were \"desperate\" to get dresses in case there was another lockdown.\n\"Brides I'm getting calls from are not even getting married until October 2022, but they want to get their dresses now because they're afraid they won't be able to if we have to shut again for a couple of months,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government has already set out different rules for weddings at different alert levels. \nAt alert level four, for instance, receptions are banned but at alert level two a maximum of 30 people can attend an indoors reception and 50 outdoors, and venues are still subject to any additional rules set at that time on hospitality.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We know many couples have made the difficult decision to postpone their wedding because of the ongoing pandemic.\n\"The current restrictions allow for the legal marriage ceremony to take place and we have changed the law to expand the range of venues where ceremonies can be performed.\n\"These are challenging times for everyone, especially those working in the events and hospitality sector, but with everyone's help, better times are ahead of us.\""

      "text": "Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has tested positive for Covid-19, the country's health minister has said.\nThe 68-year-old is \"self-isolating at home\", the minister, Faisal Sultan, tweeted.\nMr Khan, a former captain of the national cricket team who became prime minister in August 2018, received his first vaccination two days ago. \nPakistan has recorded 13,799 deaths and 623,135 cases during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nVaccination helps develop immunity to the virus that causes Covid-19 but it usually takes a few weeks for protection to develop, and the person getting the jab remains vulnerable during that time.  \nThe prime minister has been attending regular meetings, including at a security conference in the capital Islamabad that was attended by a large number of people, Reuters news agency notes.\nHe addressed that conference without wearing a mask, and attended another gathering to inaugurate a housing project for poor people on Friday, the agency reports.\nImran Khan was tested for coronavirus after developing a \"slight cough\", according to one of his senior advisers, and he now has a mild fever.\nHe received his first dose of the Chinese-produced Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday. The former cricketing superstar is generally in good health, and his adviser described him as remaining \"hale and hearty.\"\nVaccine hesitancy has been a major concern in Pakistan, and the prime minister's decision to broadcast footage of himself receiving the jab was praised as an attempt to encourage others to do the same. It seems certain Mr Khan had already been infected prior to the vaccination, but there are fears the episode will boost vaccine scepticism. \nPartial lockdown restrictions have recently been reintroduced in parts of the country following a rise in cases.\nPakistan began vaccinations for the general public on 10 March, starting with elderly people.\nAlong with Sinopharm, the country has approved the CanSinoBio, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccines for emergency use."

      "text": "Dozens of police officers have been forced to self-isolate after some positive Covid cases two weeks after Rangers' title win.\nThe Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said a number of officers who attended illegal gatherings of fans on 7 March have tested positive.\nOther officers they had contact with were required to self-isolate.\nIt comes as a major police operation is planned for Sunday's Old Firm match in Glasgow.\nThe events at Ibrox and George Square two weeks ago have directly affected 30 to 40 officers as well as their families.\nThe BBC understands at least two officers involved in the policing operation later tested positive although it is not possible to determine with certainty where they were infected.\nDavid Hamilton, chairman of the SPF, told the BBC: \"It is entirely predictable and, of course, most of these officers will not have been vaccinated. It is everything we warned about.\n\"Our call is for people to reflect on those numbers and the impact it is having on the community through the lack of policing.\n\"We did not choose to be in George Square. It is something we had to do and it is part of our role.\"\nMr Hamilton urged both Rangers and Celtic fans to stay at home on Sunday to avoid putting frontline police officers at risk.\nHe described Sunday's police operation as one of the largest Police Scotland has conducted with personnel being drafted in from across Scotland.\nEfforts have also been made to procure better protection for police officers, including higher-level FFP3 masks.\nA total of 28 arrests were made made and seven fines issued after crowds of fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership.\nLarge numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement despite warnings to stay at home.\nNicola Sturgeon said the crowds were \"infuriating and disgraceful\" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown.\nUnder current guidance public gatherings are banned and the \"stay at home\" order remains in place.\nFour people from a maximum of two households are able to meet outdoors with social distancing required.\nFootball games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium.\nThe 21 March Celtic v Rangers game was under threat of cancellation but was given the green light on Friday.\nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the decision to allow the game to go ahead followed \"extensive engagement\" with the clubs, the SPFL, Police Scotland and Glasgow City Council.\nHe said: \"Police Scotland have confirmed there will be a significant police presence in Glasgow to maintain public safety.\n\"I urge the fans to listen to the messages from their clubs, the police and government to stay at home.\n\"I also encourage Celtic and Rangers - and all other clubs in Scotland - to continue to encourage their supporters to stay home during games until they are permitted to return.\"\nPolice Scotland warned that officers would make arrests if there were any mass gatherings after the match, which is due to kick off at noon.\nAssistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said the clubs had acted \"really, really responsibly\" to convey the \"stay at home\" message to fans, and he urged supporters to follow this advice.\nMr Higgins said: \"Detailed plans are in place for an extensive and proportionate policing response to this weekend's match at Celtic Park.\n\"Our approach throughout the pandemic has been to encourage people to do the right thing to avoid the spread of the disease.\n\"However, where officers encounter blatant breaches of the legislation they will not hesitate to enforce the law where necessary to ensure public safety.\"\nResponding to the positive police cases, a Police Scotland spokeswoman said: \"Police Scotland is following Scottish government and health guidance and where cases of coronavirus are identified, we work with the local health board and adhere to Test and Protect procedures. \n\"We have sufficient capacity and as a national service Police Scotland can flex resources should there be a requirement to do so.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

The gas emissions will be monitored closely,\" the IMO said. \nThe IMO said the eruption of Fagradalsfjall began at about 20:45 GMT on Friday, and was later confirmed via webcams and satellite images.\nA coastguard helicopter was sent to survey the area, about 30km (19 miles) from Reykjavik. \nIt then sent first images of the lava snaking its way down after the eruption.\n\"I can see the glowing red sky from my window,\" said Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, who lives in Grindavik, 8 km (5 miles) from the eruption.\nA magnitude 3.1 earthquake was recorded 1.2 km from Fagradalsfjall just several hours earlier.\nIceland frequently experiences tremors as it straddles two tectonic plates, which are drifting in opposite directions."

      "tags": "Schools,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Permanently changing term times and school hours could help pupils to catch up on teaching missed during the pandemic, a leading academic says.\nSchool hours could be condensed into four longer days to give time for extra support, said Gareth Evans, of the University of Wales Trinity St David.\nHe added shorter summer holidays could also help children from more disadvantaged backgrounds.\nThe education minister said there are no current plans to change term dates.  \nBut Mr Evans, director of education policy, argued more should be done to capitalise on lower Covid rates in the summer.\n\"The infection rates are likely to remain around for some time and Covid is not going to go away,\" he said.\n\"If we can repackage school term times to accommodate a slightly shorter summer break and a slightly longer Christmas break, I think that will do us no harm in terms of mitigating Covid. \n\"There's also a very key educational reason for doing this, we know that learners don't benefit from a six-week break over the summer period.\n\"It's not natural to break learning up for that long and children from more disadvantaged backgrounds tend to suffer the most.\"\nAll pupils are expected to return to the classroom after Easter, following a phased return and months of remote learning. \nMr Evans said tweaking the hours of the school week could also help schools find extra time for catch-up work or for teacher and pupil well-being. \n\"I think these are extreme circumstances and they demand radical and innovative responses,\" he said. \n\"An asymmetric week - or a four-day school week as it's sometimes known - is also something that we should definitely explore.\n\"Schools can have a reduction in break times and start slightly earlier to accommodate them having an earlier finish on a Friday, or an afternoon off here and there to support more bespoke individual learning and catch-up.\"\nMr Evans said that if school hours were mostly condensed into four longer days, then it could also allow learners and staff to make up for lost time in other parts of life.\n\"I think what it could do is create more time for independent learning, more time for one-to-one learning support and give pupils the chance to spend more time catching up socially with their peers and at home with their families,\" he added.\n\"I think we'll be doing very much the right thing by our learners and supporting school staff as well, because let's not forget that they have been through an awful lot this past year themselves. They will need time to recover and repair.\"\nDafydd Trystan, who previously sat on the independent panel tasked with \"re-imagining schooling\" by the Welsh government, agreed that the pandemic presented an opportunity to change the system. \n\"We have a pattern of schooling in Wales today that is based on 19th Century practices,\" he said. \n\"I think it's high time we at least reach the 20th Century, I hope for the 21st Century.  \n\"I think by looking at the school day, certainly at school terms, there's a way to do that. \n\"Potentially you could reduce the length of the summer holidays which are a challenge for parents, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds. \n\"Maybe you have six terms with gaps of two to four weeks between them.\"\nUK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson previously said longer school days and shorter holidays were being looked at there. \nHowever, Mary van den Heuvel, from the National Education Union Cymru, said it was \"unhelpful and a distraction\" to consider changing school patterns when some pupils had not yet had the chance for a full return to school.\n\"What we've really got to remember is that children and young people have had a really difficult year too,\" she said.\n\"Any kind of focus on catch-up is going to really be about ensuring their well-being is supported.\n\"I think it's really difficult to judge how long we're looking at in terms of catch-up.\n\"I think we are going to need to see some support over the summer, but we've already got things like SHEP (School Holiday Enrichment Programme) which is obviously an enrichment programme to support children and young people.\"\nMs van den Heuvel said one option could be to pay local authorities to provide extra support during the holidays, using staff who are \"able to work over the summer and who aren't desperate for a break because they've been working really incredibly long hours\".\nMeanwhile, there have been calls to \"scale-up\" opportunities for children to take part in sports and arts activities over the summer. \nThe children's commissioner for Wales, the Urdd and Sport Wales all argue there needs to be \"a stronger emphasis\" on holiday activities for children. \nA spokesperson for the Welsh government said: \"There will be no changes to term dates this academic year. \n\"However, the minister has a long-standing view that we should consider long-term changes to the rhythm of the academic year to address issues such as learning loss, improved opportunities for community activities and shorter terms to support pupil and teacher well-being. \n\"She established a panel to review this, and hopes that work can restart soon.\""

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has said she stands by \"every word\" of her evidence to the Alex Salmond committee amid renewed pressure from political opponents.\nA spokesperson for the first minister accused the committee of politically-motivated smears and rejected some of the findings which have emerged from the unpublished report.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have called for Ms Sturgeon to resign.\nThe committee's convener has expressed \"dismay\" at the leaks to the media.\nThe full report is due to be published on Tuesday. \nThose parts which are critical of Ms Sturgeon were agreed by five votes to four, with the SNP members on the cross-party committee voting against.\nThe committee said it was \"hard to believe\" that Ms Sturgeon did not know of concerns of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Salmond before November 2017 - which is when she says she was first alerted to any issues.  \nThe BBC understands that the report will say that if Ms Sturgeon did have such knowledge, then she should have acted upon it.\nThe report also concluded that Ms Sturgeon gave an \"inaccurate account\" of what happened when she met Mr Salmond at her home on 2 April 2018, and had misled the committee.\nAnd the committee said it was concerned that Ms Sturgeon did not notify the government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, about that meeting until 6 June 2018.\nThe report says: \"She should have made the permanent secretary aware as soon as possible after the 2 April 2018 meeting, at which point she should have confirmed she would cease contact with Alex Salmond.\"\nThe report is also expected to be highly critical of Ms Evans.\nA spokesperson for the first minister said on Friday that she had told the truth to the committee, and stood by \"every word of her evidence\". \nThe spokesperson said the suggestion that the committee had found it \"hard to believe\" that she did not previously know about allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Salmond was \"not supported by a single shred of evidence\".\n\"On this, the committee appears to have resorted to baseless assertion, supposition and smear - that is not how serious parliamentary committees are supposed to work, and in behaving this way they are simply exposing their base political motives,\" said the statement.\nThe spokesperson also accused the committee of ignoring and suppressing evidence which supported Ms Sturgeon's evidence that she told Mr Salmond in April 2018 that she would not intervene on his behalf.\nHowever, the Scottish Conservatives say that if the first minister does not resign by Tuesday, they will seek to hold a vote of no confidence in her on Wednesday.\nThe party's Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson said: \"If Nicola Sturgeon has a shred of integrity, she should be considering her position. She has every opportunity to do the right thing and resign.\n\"No first minister is above the fundamental principles of honesty and trust. There is no question that Nicola Sturgeon has misled parliament and broken the promises she made to tell the truth.\n \"The SNP's erratic outburst today against the committee shows the panicked spiral they are now in.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would not \"prejudge\" the outcome of the report\nBut he said that if the report found the first minister had misled parliament, and potentially broken the ministerial code, then it would be \"incredibly serious\".\n\"The code itself is clear, if the code has been breached the individual should resign,\" he said.\nHowever, Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the process had \"turned into a complete farce\", with \"party politics over-riding the public interest\".\nWithin a week, Holyrood will be on a break for the election and a six-week campaign for votes will be under way. \nWe know there will be arguments over coronavirus recovery and indyref2, but there will also be another major theme: truth and trust. \nThat debate will feed off the two reports due in the next few days on the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. \nWhen the Holyrood committee publishes its findings on Tuesday, we know the opposition majority will conclude that Nicola Sturgeon gave them a misleading account, which the first minister denies. \nA separate independent investigation by Ireland's former prosecution chief, James Hamilton, will decide whether or not the first minister broke conduct rules and recommend sanctions, if required. \nThe Conservatives have already decided Ms Sturgeon lied to parliament and should resign, and they intend to hold a vote of no confidence in her on Wednesday if she does not quit. \nWith the continued support of the Scottish Greens, the first minister can survive what she regards as a nakedly political attempt to oust her and let the public decide whether she should remain in office. \nThere has never been a Holyrood election campaign curtain-raiser anything like this. \nThe committee's convener, SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, expressed her anger that \"accounts of the conclusions of the draft report\" had been leaked to the media.\n\"I am dismayed by the damage this may do to the value of the committee's work, which I have long hoped would improve the treatment of the complainers of sexual harassment,\" she said.\n\"The selective leaking of particular committee recommendations has shifted the focus away from these goals, and the recommendations which seek to achieve it, and onto party political terrain which will likely frustrate, not assist, the women at the heart of this.\"\nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants.\nThe former first minister was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses following a judicial review, and was subsequently acquitted of sexual assault charges in a High Court trial.\nA separate inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code is being carried out by James Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer. He is also expected to publish his report in the coming days.\nYou can find out more about the background to this story on Panorama: Salmond v Sturgeon, available on iPlayer now."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "tags": "Coronation Street,Television",
      "text": "When Tyrone and Alina stole a kiss in Friday's episode of Coronation Street, many viewers will have been rightly left wondering how they filmed it following social distancing guidelines.\nThe answer: real-life kissing doubles.\nActors Alan Halsall and Ruxandra Porojnicu were filmed talking before their kiss, but did not get within two metres of one another, ITV bosses said.\nInstead, regular Corrie extra Alex Mulvaney and his wife Hannah then stepped in for the romantic moment.\n\"My agent said that Coronation Street needed extras who were in a support bubble, and because I used to be an extra three times a week and they knew half of my family had done extra work on the show, it worked out perfectly,\" explained Mulvaney.\n\"My partner Hannah hadn't done any extra work before, but my agent knew she had dark hair like Alina's so I asked her if she wanted to do it,\" he added.\n\"Hannah was nervous at first, but she is a big Coronation Street fan. I had been on set many times before, and I was able to talk her through what to expect - she was a bit star-struck when she saw the actors.\"\nLike most other shows, Coronation Street stopped filming during the first national lockdown in March 2020 and resumed filming in a restricted manner several months later.\nPorojnicu, who plays Alina, said the (non) kissing scene was a \"challenge\" but one she \"really enjoyed\".\nAlthough their characters look like they are sitting together, the actors were filmed having the conversation separately. The footage was  composited together during post-production, giving the illusion they were next to each other. \nThe design department taped a pair of sunglasses onto a telescopic radio aerial to ensure the actors had the correct eye line, so they would appear to be looking into each other's eyes. \n\"It was difficult not being able to look into each other's eyes for the emotion of the scene but Coronation Street came up with a clever way to cheat that with sunglasses on an aerial,\" the actress said.\n\"Everything that's been said in the scene leads to the kiss which is very important for Alina because it is the first time that she has said out loud to Tyrone that she is falling for him.\"\nProducer Iain MacLeod praised the popular programme's writers, cast and crew for having \"cleverly worked around\" restrictions, for the best part of a difficult year.\nWhen the characters Debbie and Kevin were trapped in a fridge, the actors were tested for Covid beforehand and were placed in a bubble for the three days of filming, as were Alya, Yasmeen and Geoff for the dramatic rooftop scenes for the 60th anniversary show in December.\n\"We have therefore told the same stories throughout the pandemic that we would have told in 'normal' times,\" said MacLeod.\n\"But it just felt wrong to tell a story of an illicit liaison, where someone betrays their partner based on lust and sexual attraction, only for us not to see any of the chemistry and closeness.\n\"Hence the smoke and mirrors here.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wealthy countries - including the UK - are blocking proposals to help developing nations increase their vaccine manufacturing capabilities, documents leaked to BBC Newsnight show.\nSeveral poorer countries have asked the World Health Organization to help them. \nBut richer nations are pushing back on provisions in international law that would enable them to achieve this.\nThis is according to a leaked copy of the negotiating text of a WHO resolution on the issue.\nAmong those richer nations are the UK, the US, as well as the European Union.\n\"Where we could have language in there that would make it easier for countries to produce more vaccines and more medicines within their country, it would include initiatives that would finance and facilitate that. The UK is on the opposite side of the argument of trying to remove those kinds of progressive proposals from the text,\" says Diarmaid McDonald, from Just Treatment, a patient group for fair access to medicines. \nA spokesperson for the UK government says \"a global pandemic requires a global solution and the UK is leading from the front, driving forward efforts to ensure equitable access around the world to Covid vaccines and treatments\".\nThe spokesperson says the UK is one of the largest donors to international efforts to ensure over one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines get to developing countries this year.\nIf and when governments should intervene to ensure affordable supplies of medicines is a long-standing issue. \nBut the ability of different countries to source vaccines and drugs has been highlighted by the pandemic. \nMany experts say equitable access to vaccines is essential to prevent cases and deaths and to contribute to global population immunity.\nBut the global capacity for producing vaccines is about a third of what is needed, says Ellen t'Hoen, an expert in medicines policy and intellectual property law. \n\"These are vaccines that are produced in wealthy countries and are in general kept by those wealthy countries.\n\"Developing nations are saying we need to have a share of the pie, not only the share of the vaccines, but also the share of the right to produce these vaccines,\" she adds. \nTo make a vaccine you not only need to have the right to produce the actual substance they are composed of (which is protected by patents), you also need to have the knowledge about how to make them because the technology can be complex. \nThe WHO does not have the authority to sidestep patents - but it is trying to bring countries together to find a way to bolster vaccine supplies. \nThe discussions include using provisions in international law to get around patents and helping countries to have the technical ability to make them.\nBut the drug industry argues that eroding patents would hinder its ability to invest in future treatments for Covid and other illnesses. \nEarlier this month, representatives of the US drug industry wrote to US President Joe Biden to share their concerns.\n\"Eliminating those protections would undermine the global response to the pandemic,\" they wrote, including ongoing efforts to tackle new variants. \nIt would also create confusion that could potentially undermine public confidence in vaccine safety, and create a barrier to information sharing, the representatives said.\n\"Most importantly, eliminating protections would not speed up production,\" they added. \nOthers agree. Anne Moore, an expert in vaccine immunology, worries about what impact undermining patents will have on future research. \n\"Over time we see fewer and fewer organisations and commercial companies being in the vaccine field because there's so little return on it,\" she says. \nDrug companies point out they have also donated financially and given medicines to help tackle the pandemic. \nBut campaigners argue that about \u00a390bn ($125bn) of public money has gone into developing Covid treatments and vaccines so the public should have a stake. Once the pandemic ends, there is a lot of money to be made, they say.\n\"It's obvious that there are longer-term plans to increase the price of these vaccines once the most urgent phase of the pandemic is over. So that is another reason why developing countries are saying we need to gain the ability to produce these vaccines ourselves now,\" Ms t'Hoen says.  "

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The world faces a \"catastrophic moral failure\" because of unequal Covid vaccine policies, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was not fair for younger, healthy people in richer nations to get injections before vulnerable people in poorer states.\nHe said over 39 million vaccine doses had been given in 49 richer states - but one poor nation had only 25 doses. \nMeanwhile, both the WHO and China were criticised for their Covid response.\nAn independent panel commissioned by the WHO said the UN public health body should have declared an international emergency earlier, and also rapped China for not taking public health measures sooner.\nSo far, China, India, Russia, the UK and the US have all developed Covid vaccines, with others being made by multinational teams - like the American-German Pfizer vaccine.\nAlmost all of these nations have prioritised distribution to their own populations.\nSpeaking at a WHO executive board session on Monday, Dr Tedros said, \"I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries.\"\nDr Tedros said a \"me-first\" approach would be self-defeating because it would push up prices and encourage hoarding. \n\"Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering,\" he added.\nAnd the WHO head called for a full commitment to the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax, which is due to start rolling out next month. \n\"My challenge to all member states is to ensure that by the time World Health Day arrives on 7 April, Covid-19 vaccines are being administered in every country, as a symbol of hope for overcoming both the pandemic and the inequalities that lie at the root of so many global health challenges,\" Dr Tedros said.\nSo far, more than 180 countries have signed up to the Covax initiative, which is supported by the WHO and a group of international vaccine advocacy groups. Its aim is to unite countries into one bloc so they have more power to negotiate with drug companies.\nNinety-two countries - all of them low or middle-income - will have their vaccines paid for by a fund sponsored by donors. \n\"We have secured two billion doses from five producers, with options of more than one billion more doses, and we aim to start deliveries in February,\" Dr Tedros said.\nReacting to Dr Tedros' warning, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"The UK is the world's biggest supporter, financial supporter, of the global programme to ensure access to vaccines in all countries in the world.\"\nMr Hancock said the UK had \"put the most financial support in these international efforts to ensure everybody has access to vaccines\".\nThe UK government has provided \u00a3548m ($734m) to the Covax programme.\nMore than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures.\nPeople in their 70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable in England are now among those being offered the jab.\nLast month, the People's Vaccine Alliance coalition of campaigning bodies said that rich countries were hoarding doses of Covid vaccines and people living in poor countries were set to miss out.\nIt said that nearly 70 lower-income countries would only be able to vaccinate one in 10 people.\nCanada, in particular, came in for criticism, with the coalition saying the North American nation had ordered enough vaccine doses to protect each Canadian five times.\nIn December, Karina Gould, Canada's minister of international development, denied allegations the country was hoarding vaccines, saying any discussion of a surplus was \"hypothetical\" as the doses had not been delivered. \nShe said Canada was providing C$485 million ($380 million; \u00a3280 million) to help developing countries cope with Covid-19.\nIn their interim report, the panel of independent experts said both China and the WHO should have acted faster during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe document said that Beijing should have acted more forcefully to localise the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan first detected in late 2019.\nThe experts also criticised the WHO for only declaring a global emergency on 30 January 2020.\n \"The global pandemic alert system is not fit for purpose,\" the report said. \"The World Health Organization has been underpowered to do the job.\"\nThe panel of experts was led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf."

      "text": "A sanitation worker became the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine as the country began the world's largest inoculation drive. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme, which aims to vaccinate more than 1.3 billion people against Covid.\nHe paid tribute to front-line workers who will be the first to receive jabs. \nIndia has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the United States. \nMillions of doses of two approved vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - were shipped across the country in the days leading up to the start of the drive. \n\"We are launching the world's biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,\" Mr Modi, said, addressing the country on Saturday morning. \nHe added that India was well prepared to vaccinate its population with the help of an app, which would help the government track the drive and ensure that nobody was left out.\nMr Modi spoke at length about doctors, nurses and other front-line workers \"who showed us the light\" in \"dark times\". \n\"They stayed away from their families to serve humanity. And hundreds of them never went home. They gave their life to save others. And that is why the first jabs are being given to healthcare workers - this is our way of paying respect to them.\"\nGeeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\nDoctors and medical staff at Delhi's Max hospital tell me a lot of hope is being pinned on the vaccination drive. One official described it \"as a new dawn\" and said \"it's the beginning of Covid's end\". \nInside the waiting room, there are posters on the wall with information about the documents one needs to bring, how safe the vaccine is, and the precautions that need to be taken even after one's been vaccinated.  Among those being vaccinated on Saturday are doctors, nurses and front-office staff from all departments.\nThe names have been been chosen alphabetically so those getting jabs are mostly those with names starting with the letter A.\n\"The pandemic has played havoc in the country. I hope the vaccine will rid us of the fears and we will be able to breathe easy,\" Dr Anil Dass said after getting the jab.\nAshutosh Chaturvedi, a 31-year-old male nurse described as a \"Covid warrior\" by hospital officials, became the first recipient of the vaccine at Max.\n\"I'm fine, I feel good,\" he told reporters as he came down the hospital ramp, which has been decorated with blue, green and white balloons. \nSince April, he told me, he's worked in the emergency wing of the Covid ward, tending to those afflicted with the coronavirus.\n\"I haven't seen my wife and nine-month-old daughter since then. A month later, once I've received the second dose, I'll visit my family,\" he said. \nMr Modi also appealed to people to continue adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and following social distancing. He said the country cannot afford to be complacent as vaccinating the entire population will take time.\nHe also urged people not to believe any \"propaganda and rumours about the safety of the vaccines\".\n\"I want to tell people that the approval to these vaccines was given only after scientists and experts were satisfied about its safety,\" he said. \nAn estimated 10 million health workers will be vaccinated in the first round, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other front-line workers.\nNext in line will be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions. India's electoral rolls, which contain details of some 900 million voters, will be used to identify eligible recipients. \nThe government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August. This will happen in state-run health care centres, schools, colleges, community halls, municipal offices and wedding halls. \nSeveral hospitals across India are giving the first doses of the vaccine. \nDr Atul Peters was among those who got the jab at Max hospital.\n\"It's a very big day. I'm grateful to those who worked hard to make this a reality. I was very very happy when I got a call informing me that my name was on the list.\n\"We worked hard during the pandemic to save lives and we are also taking the jab first to dispel fears in people's minds that the vaccine is not safe,\" he told the BBC.\nIndia's drug regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally-made by pharma company Bharat Biotech. \nBut concerns have been raised over the efficacy of Covaxin because the regulator's emergency approval came before the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. The regulator and the manufacturer have said the vaccine is safe, and that the efficacy data would be available by February. \nBoth vaccines will be given as two injections, 28 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity would begin to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect 14 days after the second dose.\nThe status of the vaccines and recipients will be electronically tracked in real time - some 8 million people who will receive the early jabs have been already registered. More than 600,000 people have been trained for the drive.\nThe jabs will be voluntary, and recipients will be given a certificate of vaccination after they complete both doses.  \n\"I expect India's vaccination programme will be run much better than most countries because of the considerable government investment and early preparedness,\" Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts, told the BBC. \nWith more than 10 million cases, India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US.\nThe largest vaccination drive in the country, however, begins at a time when infections have fallen sharply, and much of life has returned to normal. A limited availability of doses in the initial phase, therefore, is not likely to pose a problem.\nMost scientists feel India is primed for the challenge as it is a vaccine-making powerhouse and has run, for decades, a well-oiled immunisation programme for tens of millions of new-borns and mothers-to-be.\nBut the real challenges will begin when the general population starts receiving the jabs. \nIndia will use its formidable election machinery to deliver and track doses to recipients in far corners of the country. It is also likely to use digital platforms and apps to enable people to register for the doses. \nHowever, not every Indian owns a smart phone or knows how to operate an app, so it will be interesting to see what the government does to make sure that there are no inadvertent exclusions. \nVaccine hesitancy is the other concern. \nThe recent controversy over the hurried approval of Covaxin, many feel, could undermine confidence. There's a history of hesitancy about receiving the polio vaccine in parts of northern India, triggered by rumours about vaccines being impure and affecting fertility. Similar disinformation is now circulating about Covid vaccines on social networking apps, such as WhatsApp. \nThe government will need consistent, clear-eyed communication to bolster vaccine acceptance and community perception of the programme. \nVaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such \"adverse events\" following immunisation. \nBut researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Summer holidays overseas are \"extremely unlikely\" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, a scientist on a government advisory body has said.\nThe UK faces a \"real risk\" if people travel abroad, Dr Mike Tildesley said.\nForeign holidays are currently not allowed and returning travellers have to quarantine.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was \"too early to tell\" when holidays abroad would be allowed.\nUnder the current road map for easing restrictions, the earliest date people in England could holiday abroad would be 17 May.\nPeople can currently travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work, with anyone who does having to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form stating a valid reason for leaving the country.\nA government taskforce will report to the prime minister on 12 April detailing when and how international travel can resume.\nIn Scotland, national clinical director Jason Leitch also said foreign summer holidays in Europe were looking \"less likely\" as Covid numbers in some countries were a \"cause for concern\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said on Saturday morning half of all adults in the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine.\nFriday was also a record-breaking day for jabs, Mr Hancock added.\nDr Tildesley, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into Sage, said there was a danger holidaymakers could bring back variants, like the one that emerged in South Africa - which were less susceptible to vaccines.\nDr Tildesley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think that international travel this summer is, for the average holidaymaker, sadly I think, extremely unlikely.\n\"I think we are running a real risk if we do start to have lots of people going overseas in July, for instance, and August because of the potential for bringing more of these new variants back into the country.\n\"What is really dangerous is if we jeopardise our vaccination campaign by having these variants, where the vaccines don't work as effectively, spreading more rapidly.\"\nFuture vaccination campaigns might need to be considered to tackle future variants, but \"the longer that we can push that down the road... the better\", Dr Tildesley added.\nProf Andrew Hayward, from Sage, said it was \"unlikely\" the government would want to encourage travel to European countries currently experiencing high levels of coronavirus infections.\n\"I suppose one of the more worrying things about this resurgence is that in some parts of Europe the South African variant is beginning to creep up to higher levels,\" he told Times Radio.\nHe said this variant was of \"particular concern\" because vaccine effectiveness against it was \"quite low\".\nAirlines UK, which represents UK-registered carriers, said it was \"too early to say\" what the state of Covid will be in Europe and the rest of the world in 10 weeks' time.\n\"We have always said any reopening must be risk-based, but also led by the overriding assumption that as the vaccine rollout accelerates both here and abroad, a phased easing of restrictions is achievable,\" Airlines UK said.\n\"We know that universal, restriction-free travel is unlikely from 17 May but under a tiered system, based on risk, international travel can meaningfully restart and build up, with minimal restrictions in time.\"\nFebruary's announcement of the roadmap for easing restrictions in England was followed by a flurry of reports from airlines and holiday companies that future bookings had surged - particularly from July onwards.\nAlthough domestic operators reported strong demand for UK-based getaways, many people are clearly desperate to go abroad when it is allowed. \nStricken travel and tourism firms desperately need their business. They see this summer as crucial.\nBut although 17 May is in the calendar as the earliest possible date for international leisure trips to resume, this has never been guaranteed. \nNor do passengers yet know exactly what rules or systems might be in place to enable travel to re-start. \nAll eyes will be on what the global travel taskforce reports on 12 April.\nThere are thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid circulating but there has been particular focus on those first found in three countries:\nThese variants could be much more contagious or easy to catch but there is no evidence any of them cause much more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected.\nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus but scientists believe they should still work, although perhaps not quite as well.\nVaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in the future to be a better match.\nRead more.\nMeanwhile, Kate Bingham, the former head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, said some European leaders were being \"completely irresponsible\" over their approach to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\n\"If I was sitting in those countries I would not be happy to have leaders that are undermining a vaccine that could actually protect,\" Ms Bingham told the Daily Telegraph.\nSeveral countries decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following reports some people suffered blood clots after receiving the jab.\nData supplied by AstraZeneca showed there had been fewer than 40 reports of blood clots among the 17 million people across Europe who had been given the vaccine.\nUK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the Covid vaccine caused blood clots and Boris Johnson has said the vaccine is safe - receiving it himself on Friday.\nDr Catherine Smallwood, from the World Health Organization, said: \"We can't talk about the interest of one country or one city or one part of the world, this is so interconnected and we've really got to come out of this together.\"\nProf Sir John Bell, a member of the government's vaccine taskforce, criticised France for changing its vaccine advice, calling it \"crackers\".\nFrance is refusing to give the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s having previously said it was unsuitable for older people - a move Prof Bell said undermined confidence in the vaccination rollout.\n\"It doesn't make any sense. The whole thing looks completely crackers. They are changing the rules almost every week,\" he told Today.\n\"They are really damaging people's confidence in vaccines generally - not just the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\"They are sitting on a massive stockpile of vaccines that they haven't deployed yet and at the same time they have got a massive wave of the new variants coming across the country.\" \nMore than 26 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures."

He said an exhibition centre had also been suggested.\n\"A lot of people don't know what she did,\" he said. \"She came from an ordinary background like myself in the East End of London.\n\"She had tough times and hard times and she was always down-to-earth - never grand, and always kind and generous.\n\"These days, many celebrities are grand and remote but Vera was never like that.

She used her birthday and VE Day to give messages of hope.\nOn VE Day, she quoted from her most well-known song and said: \"We will meet again.\"\nThe wartime song had also been echoed by the Queen in a special televised address in April - when she acknowledged the hardship Britons were facing during the Covid-19 crisis.\nDame Vera, the daughter of a plumber, was born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917 in the London suburb of East Ham, and discovered her talent for singing at an early age.\nHer stage name, Vera Lynn, came from her grandmother's maiden name.\nLater, when she volunteered for war work, she was told the best thing she could do was to keep on being an entertainer.\nFollowing her death, tributes from around the world included Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing her as a \"truly great Briton\".\nA promotional video to be released next week will include contributions from Katherine Jenkins, Sir Tim Rice, Sir Paul McCartney and Anthony Andrews."

      "text": "A move by the UK government to compel Stormont to implement abortion laws will have \"serious consequences for devolution\", a DUP MP has said.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson said it would be a \"very serious breach of the devolution settlement\".\nWestminster is planning to give Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis new powers to take such action.\nNorthern Ireland's abortion laws changed last March after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution.\nSpeaking on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, the DUP leader in the House of Commons, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the action should be a concern even for those who support the provision of abortion services. \nHe said people \"should recognise the danger of what the secretary of state is doing here\" and \"if he can do it on this, then it could happen on many other areas\". \nBBC News NI understands that Northern Ireland's attorney general advised the Stormont executive that commissioning abortion services could be regarded as a controversial matter under the terms of the ministerial code.\nThe code states issues which are \"significant or controversial\" must be brought to the executive.   \nSome Stormont parties had been calling on Health Minister Robin Swann to commission the services.\nBut he has maintained that it requires the support of the whole executive.\nIt is believed Attorney General Brenda King gave the advice to Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, who asked her whether Mr Swann was required to get approval of the executive before setting up abortion services through the Department of Health.\nIt is understood Ms King's view was that if Mr Swann acted without consensus of the full executive, there was a risk of a legal challenge.\nA statement issued earlier by the Department of Health reflected this, and stated that Mr Swann's position was that the issue of abortion services was controversial and required the support of the whole executive.\n\"He does not believe that a ministerial decision to commission and fund abortion services would be defensible in court in the absence of executive approval,\" it added.\nWhile the law was passed last March, commissioning of full services has been stalled due to differences within the five-party executive.\nThis latest development, first reported by the Guardian, will see the NI secretary lay new regulations in Parliament early next week.\nThe move will let him direct Northern Ireland's Department of Health to commission the services.\nStormont and Westminster are also facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over the delay.\nThe law changes meant abortion laws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nIt is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities.\nAlliance Party assembly member (MLA) Paula Bradshaw said the responsibility for providing abortion services lay with the health minister.\nShe said he had the power, responsibility and legal duty to provide a \"comprehensive framework for our healthcare professionals to operate within\". \nMs Bradshaw said while she believed in devolution, she welcomed the intervention of the NI secretary.\nAgriculture Minister Edwin Poots, of the DUP, wrote on social media the UK government \"would do well to listen to first minister on this issue\" and that there was anger among assembly members at \"this act of destruction on the devolution settlement\".\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Steve Aiken, said the \"controversial\" issue of abortion should be dealt with by the whole executive. \n\"Any unilateral decision by the health minister to commission and fund new abortion services without executive approval would be a breach of the Northern Ireland Act and the Ministerial Code,\" he said.\nHe added that it was \"deeply regrettable that some political parties are seeking to score points on such a sensitive issue\".\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a \"matter of regret\" the executive had not been able to \"commission services in line with its legal obligations\". \n\"The SDLP has been warning for weeks that this British government has shown no restraint when it comes to interfering with the devolution settlement,\" he said. \nMs Hargey said it was \"unfortunate and unnecessary\" that the action was not able to be taken locally. \nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said the \"executive as a whole, and certainly those parties who are blocking the commissioning of these services, need to be implementing them as soon as possible\". \nShe said she had unsuccessfully tried to have the issue placed on the agenda for the executive last week, and would try again for next week. \nThe Church of Ireland said the move was \"unjustified\" now Stormont was sitting again. \nArchbishop of Armagh John McDowell said it was \"clearly a devolved matter\".\nThe Presbyterian Church said it would \"seriously undermine\" devolution and called on Mr Lewis to withdraw the proposal. \nAt present health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\nIt passed its second reading on Monday with the support of a number of parties.\nSinn F\u00e9in abstained on that vote but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations.\nThe Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members."

      "text": "Donald Trump's main residence, Mar-a-Lago, has been partially closed after some staff members tested positive for Covid-19, US media report.\nThe Florida resort has served as the former president's official residence since he left office in January.\nThe club said in a statement that the Beach Club and a la carte dining room were closed, but did not specify how many people had tested positive.\nMr Trump had coronavirus last October, and was vaccinated in January.\nAt the time of his diagnosis, he was hospitalised for several days and treated with the low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone. \nHis wife Melania Trump and son Barron also tested positive for the virus, as did several White House officials close to the then-president.\nIn an email to members obtained by the Washington Post, Mar-a-Lago said it was following \"all appropriate response measures\" and its banquet and event services would remain open.\nIn January, images surfaced from a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago that showed a number of guests not wearing masks. The resort was handed a formal warning by Palm Beach County which said the event had violated coronavirus regulations.\nThe New York Times reports that the club is planning to host events during the Republican National Committee spring retreat next month."

      "text": "The elections watchdog has contacted the Conservative party with questions over the funding of renovations to Boris Johnson's official flat.\nThe Electoral Commission said it was trying to establish whether any of the spending needed to be examined within its own remit on political donations.\nThe Daily Mail has reported that \u00a360,000 of party funds were used to help cover the work's \u00a3200,000 cost.\nNo 10 said all appropriate codes of conduct were followed.\nThe PM's press secretary Allegra Stratton has previously insisted that no party funds were being used to pay for any refurbishments to the Downing Street estate.\nThere have been ongoing reports about the cost of the refurbishments to the Downing Street flat where the prime minister lives with his fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds. \nLike several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, the chancellor of the exchequer's official residence.\nMr Johnson and Ms Symonds moved into the four-bedroom flat back in July 2019, and welcomed their son Wilfred in April 2020.\nThe flat, which is much larger than the one above No 10, was extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011 at a cost of \u00a330,000.\nThe Daily Mail reported on Saturday that the Electoral Commission had contacted the Tory party to check whether any funds linked to the refurbishment should have been declared in adherence with the laws on political donations.\nAn spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said in a statement: \"We are in contact with the party to establish whether any sums relating to the renovation works fall within the regime regulated by the commission.\"\n\"If so, they would need to be reported according to the rules specified in law, and would then be published by the commission as part of our commitment to the transparency of political finance.\"\nA Conservative party spokesperson said: \"All reportable donations to the Conservative party are correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law.\n\"Gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity are, and will continue to be, declared in government transparency returns.\nSources previously told the BBC that interior designer Lulu Lytle had been involved in the upgrade of the PM's flat.\nInterior designer Ms Lytle is a co-founder of Soane Britain, an upmarket London-based interior design firm which specialises in traditional craft methods.\nAccording to the company's website, its furniture can be found in hotels, restaurants, private members' clubs, yachts and private houses.\nLondon's Connaught and Claridges hotels, the Somerset Georgian manor Babington House and Shoreditch House private members' club are listed as clients."
