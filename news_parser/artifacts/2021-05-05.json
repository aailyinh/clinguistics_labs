      "title": "Covid: Canada authorises Pfizer vaccine for children aged 12 to 15",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,Canada,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Canada has authorised the use of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children between the ages of 12 and 15. \nIt is the first country to do so for that age group.  \nThe country's health ministry made the decision based on data from phase three clinical trials on children that age. \n\"The department determined that this vaccine is safe and effective when used in this younger age group,\" an adviser at the ministry said. Pfizer says its jab works well in the age group.\nCanada has already authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in people over 16. \nThe province of Alberta, which has the highest rate of the virus in the country, said it would offer vaccines to those over 12 from Monday.\nCanada has recorded more than 1.2 million coronavirus cases and roughly 20% of those have been in people under the age of 19. \nThe country's vaccine rollout has been relatively slow, caused by delivery delays. About 34% of people in the country have received at least one dose of the vaccine while the figure in the US stands at 44%, according to Our World in Data. \nThe government has also faced criticism for drawing on a supply of Covid vaccines from the Covax inoculation-sharing scheme. Covax pools funds from wealthier countries to help buy vaccines for themselves and low-income nations. \nChildren's risk of becoming very ill or dying with Covid-19 is tiny, and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment.\nAs part of the vaccine's approval, Pfizer will have to continue providing information to Canada's health ministry on the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine in those aged 12 to 15. \nIn March, Pfizer said initial results from trials of its vaccine in this age group  showed 100% efficacy and a strong immune response. \nThe US Food and Drug administration and the European Medicines Agency are currently reviewing whether they can authorise the jab for younger people, with decisions expected soon. \nUS President Joe Biden this week laid out plans to roll out vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds as soon as possible. \nPfizer is one of a number of vaccine manufacturers testing jabs on children. The aim of vaccinating them - particularly older children - would be to keep schools open, reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable children with conditions which put them at increased risk. \nModerna and Johnson & Johnson are currently testing their vaccines on those aged 12-18, with Moderna's data expected soon. \nModerna and Pfizer are also testing their jabs on younger children between six months and 11 years old. \nIn the UK, AstraZeneca is testing its vaccine on 300 child volunteers. Researchers will assess whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17. \nOn Wednesday, Mr Biden said he planned to back a World Trade Organisation waiver that would take away intellectual property rights from vaccine manufacturers. If approved, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthier countries. \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described Mr Biden's backing as a \"monumental moment in the fight against Covid\". \nBy Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter\nChildren haven't generally been included in the first phase of most countries' vaccine programmes, because under-16s weren't included in the original trials.\nDrug companies are understandably wary to test products on children, especially when their risk from the disease the vaccine protects against is low.\nBut for the families of children with certain health conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, being sure the shot is safe takes on a whole different importance. \nNow we do have some trial data from Pfizer for 12- to 15-year-olds, suggesting the vaccine is both safe and effective. And Canada is the first country to act on this data. \nAlthough most children are not at high risk from Covid, if they can begin to be safely vaccinated it is believed this could help countries to achieve herd immunity, reducing the chances of disease outbreaks in the future. \nAnd with many countries struggling to vaccinate their most vulnerable populations - against a virus that doesn't respect borders - the Canadian move could raise questions about whether the vaccines could be prioritised better elsewhere."

      "text": "Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos is now ready to take people into space.\nThe US entrepreneur's Blue Origin company says it will launch a crew aboard its New Shepard rocket and capsule system on 20 July.\nThe astronauts are likely to include company personnel, but one seat is being auctioned online.\nNew Shepard's flights are sub-orbital. They're designed to take passengers on a straight up-and-down trip that briefly goes above 100km (62 miles).\nThis is the so-called K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, which has been designated by broad international agreement as the starting point of space.\n\"Only 569 people have ever been over the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line. With our New Shepard vehicle, we're about to change that and change it dramatically,\" said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin's director of astronaut sales.\nShe declined to comment on whether Mr Bezos himself might be on the 20 July flight. \nBlue Origin's announcement is further evidence of a resurgence in space tourism after a gap of almost 12 years.\nMr Bezos's proposition is just one of several now open to the super wealthy. Rival businessman Elon Musk is expected to launch one of his SpaceX Dragonships in the autumn with an all-civilian crew aboard. It will go orbital; the capsule will stay up for several days.\nAt 18m in height and 4m wide, New Shepard is a fully reusable, vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) space vehicle. \nIt operates from desert land in Van Horn in West Texas.\nDuring a flight, the booster unit lifts the pressurised passenger vessel to about 76km in altitude, where the pair then separate.\nMomentum carries the capsule on upwards into space, before dropping back down to the ground under three parachutes. The booster also comes home in a controlled manner, making a propulsive landing on a concrete pad. \nBlue Origin is hoping the New Shepard experience will prove a big draw. Passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness at the top of the climb. They'll also get to see the blackness of space and Earth's curved horizon.\nFor the moment, the company is not discussing future pricing options - just the details of the public auction for one seat on that first mission in two months' time. Blue Origin says the cash raised from this particular sale will go to its foundation that promotes science and technology education. \nBut long-term, the company could expect to earn perhaps $200,000 (\u00a3143,780) per seat, maybe even more initially.  \n\"This is a nascent market,\" said Ms Cornell. \"We're opening the doors and look forward to seeing what the market says. \n\"I personally think people are going to see what a cool experience this is and are going to want to do it themselves. And then, as hopefully the prices come down, the scale goes up.\" \nThroughout the 2000s a number of high-value individuals paid to visit the International Space Station (ISS). But this tourism, organised under the patronage of the Russian space agency, ceased in 2009.\nNow, it seems, the sector is being rekindled. As well as the initiatives from Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson continues to push his Virgin Galactic rocket plane concept. There are also those who want to launch private space stations this decade. Among these is Axiom, a company started by a former Nasa ISS programme manager.\nBlue Origin's announcement was timed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the first spaceflight made by an American astronaut - Alan Shepard, in whose honour the new tourist vehicle is named.\nAlan Shepard conducted a 15-minute sub-orbital flight in his Project Mercury Freedom-7 capsule on 5 May, 1961."

      "text": "A French government threat to cut off Jersey's electricity over a post-Brexit fishing dispute was \"clearly unacceptable and disproportionate\", the UK government has said.\nFrench Maritime Minister Annick Girardin threatened \"retaliatory measures\" over the new licensing regime for fishing in Jersey's waters.\nAbout 95% of the island's electricity comes from France via undersea cables.\nA UK government spokesman said they were working with the EU and Jersey.\n\"To threaten Jersey like this is clearly unacceptable and disproportionate,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We are working closely with the EU and Jersey on fisheries access provisions following the end of the transition period so trust the French will use the mechanisms of our new treaty to solve problems.\"\nThe row emerged over a new licensing system for French fishing vessels.\nThe system was introduced by the Government of Jersey under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).\nJersey issued 41 licences for access to its waters on Friday when an interim agreement came to an end.\nThe Jersey government said the permits must \"correspond to the previous activity a vessel has carried out in Jersey waters\" under the terms of the TCA and its new system was \"in line with the data submitted by the French and EU authorities\".\nA spokeswoman said it took French complaints over the terms of the licensing agreement \"very seriously\" and would respond, but said it had acted in \"good faith\" setting up the regime.\n\"The government remains committed to the sustainable management of Jersey waters for the benefit of this and future generations,\" she said. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Gorst, External Relations Minister for the Government of Jersey, argued there was no justification for such severe measures.\n\"This is not the first threat that the French have made to either Jersey or the United Kingdom since we are into this new deal,\" he said.\n\"It would seem disproportionate to cut off electricity for the sake of needing to provide extra details so that we can refine the licences.\"\nOn Tuesday, he explained there was \"no time limit\" for the French fishing industry or government to provide evidence of previous activity in Jersey waters and he wanted to \"heal this relationship\".\n\"If French fishermen or the authorities have further evidence they would like to submit, we will update the licences to reflect that evidence.\"\nFrench authorities said \"new technical measures\" for fishing off the Channel Islands had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them \"null and void\".\nRepresentatives from Normandy have closed their office in St Helier in protest of \"inexplicable conditions\" in the new scheme, which had been introduced \"against all expectations\".\nThese include caps on the number of fishing days for different vessels, restrictions on gear and the closure of fishing areas.\nThe UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the self-governing Crown Dependency is \"responsible for its own territorial waters\".\nFollow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Employment",
      "text": "Almost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC have said they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time.\nSome 43 of the firms said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week. \nFour firms said they were keeping the idea of hybrid working, working from home some of the time, under review.\nCurrently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so.\nHowever, that is likely to change in June when the government hopes to end all social distancing restrictions. \n\"We're never going to go back to working the way we used to work,\" said Mark Read, chief executive of advertising firm WPP.\nBut the new ways of using the office require careful planning, he told the BBC. \n\"People are working from home three to four days a week so we probably need 20% less space, but we're not going to do that if everyone's working from home on Mondays and Fridays.\" \nOther companies cite \"smart working\" and \"flexibility\" as reasons for introducing hybrid working, with many suggesting that workers would be able to make their own choices about how often they come into the office. \nDanny Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva - which has 16,000 UK workers - said 95% of its workers said they would like to be able to spend some of their time working flexibly and remotely in different locations.\nBut she said the company had to be mindful that many staff appreciate being in an office, such as those who live alone or do not have a suitable place to work.\nRecruitment firm Adecco, which has 34,000 workers, said about four-fifths of its staff now work remotely. \n\"Rather than having pre-set rules we are encouraging our leaders to engage with colleagues to implement strategies that work for their business,\" it said. \nThe BBC questioned 50 big employers, ranging from banks to retailers, to get an idea of when workers may return to the office. \nThe firms contacted by the BBC covered 1.1 million workers in the UK.  \nBusinesses that depend on custom from office workers - such as cafes and restaurants - are keen for them to return as soon as possible. \n\"We rely really heavily on the office trade,\" Joao Almeida, of Panda Cup Coffee in London's Blackfriars, told the BBC. He was one of millions of people unable to work from home during the pandemic.\n\"There are locations that have 5,000 people, but only 140 come to the building with most working from home or maybe once a week coming in. That makes it really difficult.\" \nCarl Forder, who owns the Pottergate Pantry sandwich shop in Norwich. saw an 80% drop in business when workers, including 5,000 at the nearby Aviva office, were told to work from home where possible.\n\"We really hope a lot more office workers return to Norwich when it's safe for them to do so.\n\"It affects a lot of businesses, from the cleaners who clean the offices, right through to coffee shops and sandwich bars. We want that buzz back again.\"\nBut in the financial services industry it can be a problem if people work from home, reckons Andrew Monk, chief executive of investment bank VSA Capital. \n\"People working from home don't realise it but they're gradually getting slower and slower whereas the people in the office aren't,\" he told BBC Radio Five Live. \n\"In the financial services industry you need to discuss ideas and discuss what's going on. People working from home miss out on an awful lot of the activity in the office because we don't have time to tell them.\" \nBut there may not be a deluge of workers returning this month.  \nThe companies told the BBC they were opening offices \"in line with government guidance\", which means many plan to reopen offices from 21 June. \nSome have already reopened their offices to a limited number of workers. \nInvestment firm JP Morgan and recruiter Michael Page allowed workers to return from 29 March, while Adecco, recruiter Hays Group and WPP reopened offices on 12 April. \nInvestment firm Rathbones has allowed workers to return \"if they wish\", subject to a 25% capacity. \nWPP reopened its UK offices at a 30% capacity, but is increasing that to 50% this month. \nMany have given workers the choice, with Michael Page saying staff could return to the office \"should they choose to do so\". \nBut some other companies are delaying their office re-opening plans. \nOutsourcing giant Capita said workers have been told they will work from home until at least the end of June, while Lloyds Bank has asked staff to stay at home until at least the summer. \nTom, who works in property, is not looking forward to going back to the office. The commute is long, expensive, uncomfortable and unnecessary, he told the BBC. \n\"My office is modern and seemingly comfortable. But the culture can be difficult and the false familiarity is suffocating. It's a petri dish of anxiety and breeding ground of mental health issues.\" \nHe says working at home is more comfortable.  \n\"The technology enables a more inclusive mode of working where information is shared more easily and talent can shine. There's also more time for family and more time for real friends.\" \nIn contrast, David Kimberley said he \"couldn't wait\". He returned to the stockbroker's office he works at two weeks ago.\n\"There's something healthy about having a psychological separation between your work and home life. I find that hard to do when I'm working from home,\" he told the BBC. \n\"There's something quite gloomy, especially in winter, about working from home, and it's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen. \n\"It also makes it much harder to collaborate. I work closely with another member of the team and in the office we can sort things out in seconds, When working from home it can take 10 minutes to get a response, and you have no real idea about how they're feeling as you can't see them to gauge their emotions.\" \nOnly a few of the companies surveyed by the BBC have been shutting offices, with some saying they will wait until leases run out. \nCapita has closed 49 out of 294 of its offices since the start of the pandemic while accountants Deloitte has closed offices at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. \nLloyds Bank said it planned to close 20% of its offices over the next three years while NatWest closed its Regent House, London office last summer, in a move that had been planned, but speeded up by the pandemic. \nNewspaper group Reach has closed its district offices as part of a move to a hub-based model. Meanwhile, Welsh Water closed its head office last year. \nBut not all are keen on the move away from offices.  \nWPP boss Mark Read says he worries about the long-term impact on the company's culture and training.\n\"Advertising and creative industries are something you learn from your colleagues and you can only do that, really, if you're around them in an office.\" \nAccounting software firm Sage has just opened a new office - planned before the pandemic - which has space for 1,800 people.\nSage's chief people officer Amanda Cusdin says that despite using a mix of home and office working going forward, the office will still be needed.\n\"We know for a lot of people maybe don't have a quiet space to work at home and would rather do it in the office.\""

Furlough was extended when England locked down.\n\"I think at every point during the past 12 months during this crisis, I and the government have acted to protect people in all parts of the United Kingdom,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"If you think about things like the furlough scheme, that's protected almost half a million jobs here in Wales, 50,000 businesses have benefited from government-backed loans.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.

MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nWelsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford admitted at a campaign event his party was \"battling hard in north Wales\", where the Tories focused their energies on Wednesday.\nMr Drakeford visited the Hangfire Southern Kitchen in Barry, in the south Wales constituency of the Vale of Glamorgan.\nThe seat is held by the Conservatives in the House of Commons, but Labour in the Senedd, and is another constituency the Tories are hoping to gain from Labour.\n\"We have to restore our bargain with the people of north Wales,\" Mr Drakeford said.\nAsked if the fact that he had chosen to go to the Vale of Glamorgan suggested he was worried about the seat, he said: \"I'm here because the real contest in this election is between a Labour progressive government for Wales and handing Wales back to London with the Tories.\"\n\"In this constituency, that's exactly the argument that is on the line.\"\nPlaid Cymru's leader Adam Price said \"every vote will count in constituencies right across Wales\", telling BBC Wales the election was \"going to be won on small margins\".\nHe visited a food wholesaler and processing company at Cross Hands, in the marginal Senedd seat of Llanelli, held by Labour in 2016. \n\"Our message to people out there is get out and vote them tomorrow, every vote will count,\" he said.\n\"We have a historic opportunity to elect the first Plaid Cymru government in our history. That will send headlines across the world.\"\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has turned our lives upside down over the last year and a bit - and it has done the same for this Senedd election campaign.\nPre-Covid, Welsh Labour had been in power for more than two decades and faced a defensive election trying to hold on to a number of marginal seats against opposition parties with the wind in their sails.\nBefore the pandemic struck, few ordinary voters could have picked the Welsh Labour leader, Mark Drakeford, out of a line-up.

This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Social media,Fake News,Mark Zuckerberg,Facebook,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Donald Trump's ban from Facebook and Instagram has been upheld by Facebook's Oversight Board.\nBut it criticised the indefinite nature of the ban as beyond the scope of Facebook's normal penalties.\nIt has ordered Facebook to review the decision and \"justify a proportionate response\" that is applied to everyone, including ordinary users.\nThe former president was banned from both sites in January following the Capitol Hill riots. \nThe Oversight Board said the initial decision to permanently suspend Mr Trump was \"indeterminate and standardless\", and that the correct response should be \"consistent with the rules that are applied to other users of its platform\".\nFacebook must respond within six months, it said. \nAt a press conference, co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt admitted: \"We did not have an easy answer.\"\nShe added that she felt Facebook would \"appreciate the decision\". \n\"We are telling Facebook to go back and be more transparent about how it assesses these things. Treat all users the same and don't give arbitrary penalties.\"\nIn response, Facebook said it would \"consider the board's decision and determine an action that is clear and proportionate\".\nThe board also made a number of recommendations about how Facebook should improve its policies and the social network promised to \"carefully review\" these.\nThe Board was due to announce its decision last month but delayed the ruling in order to review more than 9,000 public responses to cases, it said. \nIn the meantime, Mr Trump, who is also banned from Twitter, launched a new website on Tuesday to update supporters with his thoughts.\nFollowing the ruling, Mr Trump wrote that \"what Facebook, Twitter, and Google have done is a total disgrace\".\n\"Free speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the radical left lunatics are afraid of the truth,\" he said, referring to himself as president.\n\"The people of our country will not stand for it! These corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our electoral process,\" he said.\nThe administration of Mr Trump's successor, Democratic President Joe Biden, declined to comment on Facebook's ruling on Wednesday.\nBut White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said it was President Biden's view that \"major platforms have a responsibility related to the health and safety of all Americans to stop amplifying untrustworthy content, disinformation and misinformation\".\nThe ruling means that Mr Trump's suspension remains in place for now.\nThe Oversight Board decided that Mr Trump had broken Facebook's community standards, and upheld the ban.\nBut it is the \"indefinite\" part of the ban that it took issue with because that is not within its own rules.\n\"It is not permissible for Facebook to keep a user off the platform for an undefined period, with no criteria for when or whether the account will be restored,\" it said in a statement.\nApplying that type of ban to Mr Trump was not following any clear procedure, it said.\nThe Board argued that Facebook had essentially issued \"a vague, standardless penalty and then [referred] this case to the Board to resolve\". \nIt said doing so meant \"Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities\" - and sent the decision back to Facebook.\nCo-chair Michael McConnell justified the timeframe saying that it was a decision \"not to be rushed\" and admitted that the firm may decide to throw it back to the Oversight Board yet again.\nSetting up a \"Supreme Court\" to rule on tricky issues seemed like a smart move by Mark Zuckerberg. Whatever the Oversight Board decided, Facebook's boss could say \"not my fault, blame the judges\".\nBut that's unlikely to wash here. There can be no more divisive issue than President Trump's presence on a platform credited or blamed by many for his electoral success in 2016 and probably crucial if he decides to run again in 2024.\nNow, the Oversight Board has thrown the hot potato right back into Mr Zuckerberg's lap.\nHe and his team have been told to go away and have a long hard think about how they handle tricky cases like this one. They will have to decide the meaning of the term \"newsworthy\" and conduct a proper inquest into the platform's role in the events of 6 January.\nAnd at the end of it all, Facebook will still have to decide what to do about Donald Trump.\nMark Zuckerberg could be forgiven for wondering whether setting up this body was such a good idea after all - and why he is paying the generous salaries of the board's members.\nOften referred to as \"Facebook's Supreme Court\", it was set up to rule on difficult or controversial moderation decisions made by Facebook.\nIt was established by Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg but operates as an independent entity, although its wages and other costs are covered by Facebook. It is made up of journalists, human rights activists, lawyers and academics. \nThe committee has already ruled on nine cases including a comment that seemed derogatory to Muslims. The post from a user in Myanmar, removed for breaking hate-speech rules, was found by the board not to be Islamophobic when taken in context. \nFollowing the Capitol Hill riots on 6 January, Facebook announced it was banning Mr Trump for breaking its \"glorification of violence\" rules. \nHundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in last year's presidential election. \nMr Trump was acquitted of a charge of inciting insurrection at the US Capitol in his second impeachment trial in February, after being accused of encouraging the violence, during which four people lost their lives.\nThe social network had originally imposed a 24-hour ban after the attack which was then extended \"indefinitely\". \nMr Zuckerberg announced that the risks of allowing Mr Trump to post were \"simply too great\". \nThe former president has also been banned from Twitter and YouTube. \nCorrection 25 May 2021: An earlier version of this article said that five people had died in the violence during the Capitol Hill riots on 6 January and this has been amended to make clear that four people died, in different circumstances.

      "text": "Political party leaders have hit the road in England in a final push for votes ahead of Thursday's elections.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the Conservatives faced some \"tough contests\" but the party was \"fighting for every vote\". \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was doing the same but had \"a mountain to climb\" to win back support in key battlegrounds.\nPolls open from 07.00 to 20:00 BST on Thursday, with results due from Friday.\nAbout 48 million people in England, Wales and Scotland will be able to take part in the elections, many of them postponed from last year because of the pandemic.\nAs well as polls for the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd in Wales, there are elections for seats on 143 English councils and 13 local mayors.\nThere will also be a by-election for the Westminster seat of Hartlepool.\nThursday's votes represent the first electoral test for parties since the Conservatives won a majority at the 2019 general election.\nThey will be the first votes since Sir Keir took over as Labour leader 13 months ago and Sir Ed Davey won the Liberal Democrat leadership race last August.\nCampaigning has been curtailed by Covid restrictions, with large public meetings moved online and limits on groups of activists going door-to-door.\nSpeaking in Stourbridge, in support of the Tory candidate for West Midlands mayor, Mr Johnson said: \"It is a very tough set of elections.\n\"When we stood last time for of these many council seats we were at a high water mark and we will be fighting for absolutely every vote.\"\nAsked if the Conservatives could win a \"hat-trick\" in the mayoral races in Tees Valley and West Midlands, and the Hartlepool by-election, he said: \"These are tough contests. \n\"Hartlepool hasn't been a Conservative seat since its inception. It will be a very tough fight, but I hope everybody gets out to vote.\"\nMr Johnson was also asked if he would allow another independence referendum in Scotland, if pro-independence parties win a majority in the Scottish Parliament elections. \nHe said: \"Let's wait and see what actually happens, but I think most people in Scotland, and around the whole of the UK, feel that - as we're coming out of pandemic together - this is not the time to have a reckless and, I think, irresponsible, second referendum.\"\nSir Keir began a frantic day of campaigning on Wednesday with a visit to Pontefract to support Labour's candidate for West Yorkshire mayor.\nAsked about a Guardian report, based on internal polling, that the party is heading for a big defeat in Thursday's Hartlepool by-election, he said: \"There was a mountain to climb when I took over as leader of the Labour Party.\n\"We lost in December 2019 very badly and I've got to make sure the Labour Party is in a position to win the next general election when it comes.\n\"That's the mountain we're climbing. We're on that mountain, we're climbing and we're going into the elections tomorrow fighting for every vote.\"\nSir Keir is also joining Labour's candidates for the mayoral races in the West Midlands and West of England.\nSir Ed Davey took the Lib Dems' campaign to the London suburb of Surbiton, where he highlighted the party's policies on the environment.\nHe described the campaign so far as \"weird\" because of the Covid restrictions, but added: \"When we have managed to talk to people, they're responding positively to the Liberal Democrat message, because we are community politicians.\n\"People know that if they get a Liberal Democrat councillor, things get done.\"\nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley was also in the capital to support the party's candidate for the Greater London mayor. \nHe said he was expecting more council seat gains, having picked up 40 at the last round of English local elections, and promised to speak for the \"unrepresented\".\n\"Once people see Greens elected and make a difference, they want more,\" Mr Bartley added.\nThe pandemic means ballots are expected to take longer than usual to count, creating greater uncertainty over when results will be declared.\nSome counts will take place overnight on Thursday, including for the Hartlepool by-election, where a result is expected early on Friday. \nBut counting in some council areas in England will take place on Friday, or over the weekend.\nA dozen of the counts for 39 police and crime commissioners elected in England will not begin until Monday. \nResults for all 60 seats in the Welsh Senedd will be known on Friday. \nScotland starts counting in some areas on Friday, but there will not be a final result until Saturday, or possibly even Sunday."

      "text": "Women and younger adults were more likely to feel depressed during the second UK coronavirus peak than men and other age groups, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data suggests.\nFour in 10 women aged between 16 and 29 were affected, compared to 26% of men.\nOne in five adults experienced depression in early 2021 - more than double pre-pandemic levels.\nBut GPs in England diagnosed fewer cases of depression in adults in 2020 compared with the year before.\nMany people may not be seeking medical help, the ONS says.\nHowever, the GP data - from March to August 2020 - may not include people who went to their GP last summer and were diagnosed with depression at a later point.\nHealth experts have always warned that the combined effects of ill health, isolation and job losses during the pandemic would have a negative impact on people's mental health and wellbeing.\nBefore the pandemic began, 10% of adults said they experienced some form of depression.\nLast autumn, following the first peak, ONS data suggested twice as many adults in Britain (19%) had feelings of depression as normal - and this new data suggests even more people were affected in early 2021 (21%).\nThis means they experienced symptoms including a lack of energy, poor appetite, sleeping problems or feeling down or hopeless.\nBetween January and March 2021, disabled people, adults who are extremely vulnerable and those living in the most deprived areas of England were more likely to say they felt depressed than other groups.\nAnd rates of depressive symptoms more than doubled in adults aged 16 to 39 years old, to 29%.\nThis compared to 39% of disabled people experiencing symptoms, 17% of men, 24% of women and 25% of people living alone.\nAround a third of the least well-off adults, defined as those who couldn't afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850, experienced some form of depression.\nYounger adults and people living with a child aged under 16 saw the largest increases in rates of depressive feelings in the early part of this year when compared to before the pandemic.\nThe ONS analysis was based on 25,935 adults answering a questionnaire which asked about their feelings. One of the eight questions posed was: \"Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?\"\nA score of 10 or more indicated moderate to severe depression symptoms.\nRichard Kramer, chief executive of charity Sense, said: \"Many disabled people have been shielding and living without their usual levels of support for more than a year, causing great anxiety and leaving them isolated, lonely and, as this data shows, depressed.\n\"No disabled person should have to experience mental health inequality.\"\nHe said the government must provide a dedicated Covid recovery plan to ensure disabled people have the right care and support.\nMental health charity Mind said the impact of the pandemic on the nation's mental health could not be underestimated.\n\"The fact that GP-diagnosed cases of adult depression have fallen during the pandemic suggests people are not going to their GP for help, perhaps because they're concerned about placing extra pressure on the NHS,\" said Stephen Buckley, head of information at Mind.\n\"This is worrying because we know that left untreated, mental health problems become more difficult and expensive to treat,\" he said."

      "text": "Accountancy giant KPMG has told its 16,000 staff they can leave early one day a week as part of a move towards more flexible working after lockdown.\nIt said staff will work at KPMG offices four days each fortnight, with the rest of the time at home or client sites.\nStaff will also get an extra two-and-a-half-hours off per week in the summer to \"promote wellbeing\" if they complete their normal 35 hours of work. \nKPMG's move is another example of big firms overhauling home-office life.  \nJon Holt, chief executive at KPMG UK, said: \"We trust our people. Our new way of working will empower them and enable them to design their own working week. The pandemic has proven it's not about where you work, but how you work.  \n\"We have listened to our people and designed this strategy around our staff and how they can best support our clients.\"  \nKPMG UK head Bill Michael resigned in February after reports that he told staff to \"stop moaning\" about the impact of Covid-19 on their lives. He was replaced by Mr Holt.\nKPMG said the plan is being introduced in response to feedback from staff who have said that they would feel comfortable spending most of their time at home.  \nIn a staff\u202fsurvey\u202fconducted in\u202fMarch,\u202f87% of respondents said they liked\u202fnot having to commute, 76% enjoyed\u202fthe greater flexibility working from home offers, and 65% felt\u202fthey now had a better work-life balance.\u202f \nEmployees who have to attend offices for work, meetings or training that need to be held in person, will not have to stay for the whole day. \nKPMG said it would spend \u00a344m during 2021 on new home-working technology and introducing more collaborative spaces at offices.\nMr Holt added:\u202f \"Our offices will become a place people go to collaborate\u202fand learn.\u202fThe consequence of the pandemic means we\u202fhave a whole\u202fcohort\u202fof people who have never been in the office\u202fand\u202fnever been coached face-to-face\u202f-\u202fwe need to get those connections back.\u202f\u202f \n\"Our new\u202fstrategy for the future of work\u202fwill enable\u202four people to\u202freconnect and test our new ways of hybrid working. This is all about flexibility.\"\nSeveral big UK employers are introducing flexible working, including HSBC, British Airways and BP. In March, Nationwide building society said it would allow its 13,000 office staff to \"choose where they work\" - offices, homes or High Street branches.\nSome 36% of employees in Britain did at least some work from home last year as the coronavirus outbreak closed many workplaces, a jump from around 26% in 2019, the Office for National Statistics said in April."

      "tags": "Belfast,IRA,The Troubles,British Army",
      "text": "Two former paratroopers accused of the murder of an Official IRA man in 1972 have been formally acquitted after their trial collapsed.\nJoe McCann, 24, was shot in disputed circumstances at Joy Street in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972.\nThe court heard he was evading arrest when soldiers opened fire, killing him.\nSoldiers A and C, both in their 70s, had pleaded not guilty. The men admitted firing shots but said they had acted lawfully when doing so.\nBoth soldiers were interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case.\nThe judge ruled that evidence as inadmissible and the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) confirmed on Tuesday it would not appeal against that decision, meaning the case could not proceed.\nAfter the prosecution confirmed it would be presenting no further evidence in the case, the judge told both former soldiers: \"In the circumstances, Mr A and C, I formally find you not guilty of the charge of murder.\"\nSpeaking outside court, Mr McCann's daughter A\u00edne said there had been \"a failure of the state at all levels\" in relation to her father's death.\n\"The RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) failed, the criminal justice failed, not only in this case but in the case of many other families,\" she said.\nMr McCann's family are to apply to the attorney general to open an inquest into his killing.\nTheir solicitor Niall Murphy said: \"This ruling does not acquit the state of murder.\"\nHe added: \"Today is not the end of the McCanns' journey for justice.\"\nIt will take time for the fallout from the collapse of this case to become clear.\nFirstly, prosecutors will examine the implications, if any, for other Troubles legacy cases involving Army veterans.\nIn four of them, decisions to bring charges have already been made - three other cases have still to be ruled upon.\nIn each of the cases, input from the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) will be looked at closely.\nHowever, at this stage prosecutors do not anticipate there being a huge impact.\nSecondly, Tuesday's development will likely intensify the debate around future Troubles prosecutions and legacy matters generally.\nPolitical capital will be made from what has happened in a Belfast courtroom.\nThe government wants to bring forward legislation protecting veterans who served in Northern Ireland and all ears will be on the Queen's speech next week.\nSolicitors for the former soldiers said the prosecution should \"never have got off the ground\" and called for an inquiry led by a senior judge to investigate \"the decision-making process and to ensure that the decision to prosecute these veterans was not political.\"\nIn a statement, the PPS confirmed it had decided to offer no further evidence against two former soldiers.\nMichael Agnew, the deputy director of public prosecutions, said that in spite of the verdict the PPS was satisfied the case had been properly brought before the courts.\nHe said evidence received in 2016 relating to the case was subjected to \"a very thorough and careful examination by a team of experienced lawyers, including senior counsel\" before the test for prosecution was met.\n\"The case overcame a number of legal challenges before reaching trial,\" he said.\n\"These challenges included an abuse of process application following which a High Court judge ruled that there was no unfairness in the decision to prosecute and that in all the circumstances the defendants could get a fair trial.\"\nHe added that the PPS \"fully respected\" the judge's ruling and acknowledged \"the enduring pain of the McCann family and how difficult this development has been for them\".\nMr Agnew said when the full written judgement became available, the PPS would \"carefully consider whether it has the potential to impact upon any other cases that are currently before the courts\".\nDet Supt Stephen Wright of PSNI's legacy investigation branch said: \"We will await the publication of the written judgment and take time to consider it fully and any impact it might have on other legacy investigations.\"\nThe trial opened last Monday and heard a day of evidence before moving to the issue of whether statements and interviews given by the ex-soldiers would be admissible.\nThe court was told that evidence implicating the soldiers came from two sources - statements given to the Royal Military Police in 1972 and interview answers given to the HET in 2010.\nThe PPS accepted that the 1972 statements would be inadmissible in isolation, due to deficiencies in how they were taken including that the soldiers were ordered to make them and they were not conducted under caution.\nHowever, prosecutors argued that the information in the 1972 statements became admissible because they were adopted and accepted by the defendants during their engagement with the HET in March 2010.\nHowever, the judge said it was not legitimate to put the 1972 evidence before the court \"dressed up and freshened up with a new 2010 cover\".\nHe questioned why the HET's re-examination did not prompt a fresh investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), with the veterans interviewed under caution. \nThe judge suggested that course of action might have made a prosecution more sustainable.\nFormer Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer, who left the government in April over legal protections for troops who served during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, attended the trial.\nSpeaking after it collapsed, he said he was \"delighted\" for the former soldiers, adding he hoped they could \"go and live the rest of their lives in peace\".\n\"The government has made very clear promises, and the prime minister has made very clear promises, on legislation to end the relentless pursuit of those who served their country in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\n\"It is time to deliver on that.\"\nFour other cases in relation to Army veterans are currently before the courts."

In the 12 months to 28 February, total sales rose to \u00a31.7bn up from \u00a31.2bn for the comparable period in the previous year. \nPre-tax profit grew by 35% to \u00a3124.7m.\nDuring the year, Boohoo was also hit by claims that one of its suppliers was paying staff below the minimum wage. The Sunday Times also reported unsafe working conditions at the Leicester-based business which supplied Boohoo's Nasty Gal brand.\nAs a result, Boohoo launched an investigation into its supply chain and set up an \"agenda for change\" programme to develop \"meaningful changes to the way we do business\".\nIn its full-year results, Boohoo's chief executive John Lyttle said that he was \"proud to lead a business that, instead of choosing to walk away from the allegations, took the immediate decision to do everything within its power to address them\".\nHowever, the company faced significant backlash over the allegations from both City shareholders such as Standard Life Aberdeen as well as other retailers, including Next and Asos, which said they would stop selling Boohoo's clothes.\nBoohoo said it had completed \u00a3250m worth of acquisitions over the past year to February, which also included Oasis and Warehouse.\nThe company, which also owns Coast and Karen Millen, said that it had successfully integrated and re-launched both these brands across its platforms.  \nThe BBC recently revealed that Boohoo was selling some identical items of clothing for different prices across a number of its brands, with differences of as much as \u00a334.\nBoohoo said it was a result of a \"genuine mistake and not business practice\".\nCommenting on its new brands, Boohoo said they were being \"re-energised and made relevant for today's consumers across a broader market demographic\"."

      "tags": "Amazon fires,Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest,Amazon rainforest,Climate change",
      "text": "Nearly 40 UK food businesses have threatened to stop sourcing products from Brazil over proposed land reforms.  \nAn open letter from the group calls on Brazil's legislature to reject a bill which could legalise the private occupation of public land.\nThe letter said the proposal could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon. \nThe bill is being considered just months after Brazil pledged to end illegal logging.  \nSainsbury's, Aldi, Greggs, the Co-Op, the British Retail Consortium, and the Hilton Food Group are among the major organisations to sign the open letter.\nA vote in the Senate on  the bill is expected within days.\nThe companies say they \"consider the Amazon as a vital part of the earth system that's essential to the security of our planet, as well as being a critical part of a prosperous future for Brazilians and all of society.\"\nRainforests are critical to mitigating the effects of climate change, as they store vast amounts of carbon.\nUnder the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, the level of deforestation in the Amazon is reported as being the highest since 2008. \nThis year alone around 430,000 acres of the Amazon have been logged or burned, according to the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project.\nThe vast majority of land is cleared either to graze cattle for beef exports, or to grow soy, which goes in to animal feed around the world.\nAt a summit in April hosted by US President Joe Biden, Mr Bolsonaro declared that Brazil would end illegal logging. The letter says these measures \"run counter\" to this \"narrative and rhetoric.\"\nThe new law would allow land that has been illegally occupied after 2014 to be put up for sale. This would potentially allow illegal occupants to buy it. \nSimilar controversial measures were first put forward in a different bill last year, but were withdrawn after more than 40 organisations made the same threat over supply chain sourcing.\nThe group says the existing protections and land designations have been \"instrumental\" in their organisations having \"trust\" in Brazilian producers.\nThe companies say that the \"door remains open to work with Brazilian partners\" to develop sustainable land management practice in Brazil. \nHowever, if this or other measures that undermine existing protections become law, they will have \"no choice but to reconsider our support and use of the Brazilian agricultural commodity supply chain.\"\nCommenting on the imminent vote, Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF-UK, said: \"We cannot fight the climate crisis without the Amazon, yet its future hangs in the balance as deforestation pushes it closer to the point of collapse.\n\"If passed, this vote in the Brazilian Congress will fuel further destruction and place greater risk on the lives of the people and wildlife who call it home. \n\"As global efforts to protect the Amazon threaten to be undermined, it's encouraging to see major businesses sounding the alarm.\"\nCathryn Higgs, head of policy at the Co-op, said it was \"imperative\" the proposed legislation wasn't \"given any airtime by the Brazilian government.\"\nSupporters of the bill say it would help small-scale farmers to clarify title deeds to land. \nThe Brazilian government has been approached for comment.\nFollow Claire on Twitter"

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus vaccines,World Trade Organization,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has thrown its support behind a move at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily lift patent protections for coronavirus vaccines.\nAdvocates of the move say it would increase global vaccine production, but drugs manufacturers argue it will not have the desired effect.\nCritics say it strips financial rewards from cutting-edge drug developers. \nThe decision by US President Joe Biden comes amid pressure from Democrats in his party to remove patent protections.\nIn announcing the new policy, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said that \"extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures\". \nMs Tai said the US would now embark on negotiations at the WTO to try to secure the waiver, but warned this could take time.\nIndia and South Africa were the leading voices in a group of about 60 countries which for the last six months has been trying to get the patents on vaccines set aside. \nOne hundred of the WTO's 164 states are said to be in favour, and a panel on intellectual property is expected to discuss the issue next month. \nIf approved, supporters say, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthy countries.\nThe countries in favour of the move met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, the UK and the EU. Mr Biden had proposed a waiver during the 2020 presidential election campaign. \nIntellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded.    \nPatents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment.\nBiotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times.\nMany developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, called the US decision \"historic\" and said it marked \"a monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19\".\nThe medical NGO, MSF - Doctors Without Borders - said the move would \"increase sufficient and timely access to these lifesaving medical tools as Covid-19 continues to ravage countries across the globe.\"\nCalls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages.\nMSF points out that many of the low-income states where it operates \"only received 0.3 percent of global Covid-19 vaccine supply while the US has secured enough doses to protect its entire population\".\nIndia, which was shipping vaccines to other countries, has now had to cancel exports as it grapples with surging coronavirus cases and falls behind on its vaccination targets.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.\nThe head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme that technology transfer should not be enforced. \n\"I'm deeply concerned if you hand this over and allow companies to try to get it done the right way, safe and high quality, you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now and it would be disruptive.\"\nHe said Western pharmaceutical companies were already sharing technology on a voluntary basis. \n\"The bottlenecks right now are trade barriers, preventing companies from moving their goods from one country to another. It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries. \n\"None of this is addressed with the patent waiver.\" \nDr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Reuters news agency that the waiver \"amounts to the expropriation of the property of the pharmaceutical companies whose innovation and financial investments made the development of Covid-19 vaccines possible in the first place\".\nNobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations short-sighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge, particularly when it comes to the new breed of mRNA vaccines - such as Pfizer and Moderna - as well as the availability of raw materials. \nIt is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production.\nInstead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby know-how is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. \nSome trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge. \nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the EU is also ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner\".\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has changed his position, now saying he is \"absolutely in favour\".  \nA UK government spokesperson said the UK was \"working with WTO members to resolve this issue\" and was \"in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines\". \nThe head of the World Health Organization called the US announcement a \"monumental moment\" in the fight against Covid-19. \nThe prospect of a waiver hit shares in the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. \nSome experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect. \nLicensing agreements are another way of boosting production. \nOne of the largest Covid vaccine producers is the Serum Institute of India which manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab under a licensing agreement with the Anglo-Swedish company.

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has won the remainder of her copyright claim against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter to her estranged father.\nIn February, Meghan won most of her claim for misuse of private information and copyright infringement.\nBut the newspaper had suggested she may not have been the sole copyright owner.\nThe duchess won her case after her former communications secretary denied co-writing the letter.\nAssociated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline - had previously argued the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's former communications secretary Jason Knauf was a co-author of the letter, meaning its copyright belonged to the Crown.\nOn Wednesday, the High Court heard that Mr Knauf has \"emphatically\" denied co-writing the letter to Thomas Markle. Through his lawyers, he said \"it was the duchess's letter alone\".\nIan Mill, representing the duchess, told the court that this \"gives the lie\" to the newspaper's suggestion that Meghan considered using the letter \"as part of a media strategy\".\nThe court also heard that lawyers representing \"the Keeper of the Privy Purse, acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen\" told Meghan's solicitors they \"did not consider the Crown to be the copyright owner\".\nLaunching their case against ANL in 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan said they were forced to take action against \"relentless propaganda\", with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to \"the same powerful forces\" as his mother.\nIn the High Court in February, Lord Justice Warby ruled the publication of Meghan's handwritten letter to her father by the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline was \"manifestly excessive and hence unlawful\".\nThe judge said it was a \"a personal and private letter\" that dealt with the duchess's \"feelings of anguish about her father's behaviour, as she saw it, and the resulting rift between them\".\nOn Wednesday, Mr Mill acknowledged that Meghan had \"shared a draft\" of the letter with Harry and Mr Knauf \"for support, as this was a deeply painful process that they had lived through with her\".\n\"Mr Knauf was responsible for keeping the senior members of the royal household apprised of any public-facing issues, the media spectacle surrounding Mr Markle being one such issue,\" the barrister said.\nThe former communications secretary had \"suggested that a reference to Mr Markle's ill-health be included\", which Meghan added, but he \"did not suggest any specific wording\", the court heard.\nHis lawyers said he did not draft any part of the letter and \"would never have asserted copyright over any of their content\".\nMr Knauf, who is now chief executive of the Royal Foundation, set up by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, had said in a joint letter with other royal aides in January that he did not want to \"take sides\" in the legal dispute.\nAndrew Caldecott, representing the publisher, said it was a \"matter of regret\" that Mr Knauf had not made clear he was not the author of the letter sooner.\nHe said as soon as ANL heard his account, the publisher indicated it would not oppose summary judgment in this case - meaning it could be resolved without going to trial.\nBut ANL is applying to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal against the judge's February ruling on privacy and copyright, when the duchess won the bulk of her case.\nAn order that it must print a statement on its front page and page three that it infringed Meghan's copyright is on hold until the Court of Appeal's decision."

We'll have another update for you on Thursday morning.\nWealthy countries including the UK should send spare vaccine doses to virus-hit nations before organising booster jabs at home, World Health Organization special envoy David Nabarro has told the BBC. He said Covid was \"fiercer than ever\" and \"causing more distress than ever\" worldwide. His comments came after Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the UK could start a booster programme as early as September. The government has also pledged to donate surplus vaccine doses to poorer nations. You can read more about the UK's vaccine programme here.\nThe entire Indian delegation in London for the G7 summit, has had to isolate after two of its members tested positive for Covid-19. India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar pulled out of face-to-face talks and will now take part virtually. He met Priti Patel in person on Tuesday but it is understood that because strict social distancing was maintained, the home secretary and others at the meeting do not need to self-isolate. \nCanada has become the first country to approve a coronavirus vaccine for children aged 12 to 15. The country's health ministry has authorised the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab for the age group. In March, Pfizer said trials of its vaccine in children aged 12 to 15 showed 100% efficacy and a strong immune response. Children's risk of becoming very ill or dying with Covid-19 is low. US President Joe Biden has also laid out plans to roll out shots for 12 to 15-year-olds as soon as possible.\nGoldman Sachs bankers in the UK and US have been told they need to be ready to return to the office in June - when they are allowed to do so. In England the government hopes to lift legal limits on social contact on 21 June, while the bank's bosses expect US workers to be back in the office on 14 June.

      "text": "A father and a student campaigner are seeking a High Court hearing to consider whether the government should tighten youngsters' access to porn.\nIoannis Dekas and Ava Vakil want the government to implement proof of age for access to pornography promised in the 2017 Digital Economy Act.\nIt comes as new research suggests the majority of 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK have recently seen pornography.\nThe government is currently preparing a new Online Harms Bill.\nThis bill would go further than the Digital Economy Act, giving the watchdog, Ofcom, powers to block access to online services - including social media platforms and search engines - which fail to do enough to protect children. \nIt is expected to be put before Parliament later this year.\nIoannis Dekas, a father of four sons, became concerned after he found one of his boys had accessed pornography.\nHe said this was a wake-up call for him and his wife as parents, making them confront the potential danger to their son and the impact on them all as a family.\n\"In the two weeks leading up to this moment, we'd noticed a drastic change in his behaviour, withdrawal, a sense of anger towards his siblings, we could sense frustration in his life.\"\nWhen he and his wife talked to their son, they found he was under peer pressure to be familiar with the language of porn.\n\"What I don't often hear is how to deal with this. What happens in your household when this happens? With the availability, it's not a matter of if, but of when.\"\nMr Dekas wants the government to put in place the age verification requirements set out in part three of the Digital Economy Act - a law that was passed in 2017.\nHowever, in 2019, the then Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said the measures would no longer go ahead, with efforts instead focused on the government's wider Online Harms Bill.\nBut Mr Dekas says that this bill still has to be brought before Parliament, and may be delayed if detailed regulations need to be drawn up.\nIn the meantime, children are being exposed to pornography, he says, when they could be protected using the Digital Economy Act's full powers.\nMr Dekas is bringing the challenge jointly with 20-year-old University of Oxford student Ava Vakil, whose letter about what she described as a culture of sexual violence in some schools went viral online.\nMs Vakil told the BBC: \"I think porn is everywhere, and growing up as a young woman I've seen the influence of that. \n\"I think young men are ingesting pornography online to an extent that people aren't aware of.\n\"I'm sure everyone, and particularly young women, can look back on so many conversations they've had with boyfriends and male friends and think 100% it was impacted by porn.\"\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it would not be appropriate to comment on legal proceedings.\nA spokesman said the government was committed to protecting children from harmful content.\nThe legal action comes as research from City, University of London found many teenagers had seen porn. \nProf Neil Thurman conducted a survey of more than 1,000 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK, using a panel from the specialist market research company Youthsite.\nWhile 63% said they came across porn on social media, 47% said they had also visited porn websites. \nThe research suggests the government's approach of widening the range of legislation to more platforms is right, Prof Thurman said. \nMore worryingly, 46% had used technology that disguises identity when browsing online, such as a virtual private network, and which could allow evasion of age verification.\nHowever, Prof Thurman said this was not a reason not to regulate access.\n\"It doesn't mean we shouldn't bring in legislation,\" he said. \"Firstly I think it would reduce accidental exposure, particularly for younger children and teenagers, and it does send a signal, not present at the moment, that they are accessing something inappropriate for their age group.\"\nVanessa Morse, head of the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation, said there was a \"wealth of evidence\" to show that viewing pornography led to harmful sexual attitudes and behaviours. \n\"The government's own research, which it published this year, showed an association between porn consumption and real world violence against women. It's no surprise considering one in eight porn videos contains sexual violence,\" she said. \n\"Pornography has made violent acts in sex completely normalised.\"\nA new report by the internet safety body, Internet Matters, looking at children's use of technology during lockdown has found that although the internet had a positive impact on how children learn and socialise, parents also reported a rise in the amount of online harms children experienced. \nA survey of 2,000 parents in the UK in March this year suggests a 39% increase in the sharing of sexual images among children since January 2020. \nPsychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, ambassador of Internet Matters, says \"as children have come to rely on technology more than ever during the pandemic, and therefore spending sometimes several hours a day online, it also gives them increased exposure to all of the risks that go with it.\"\n"

HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and not making any effort to intervene. \nNo 10 said it sent the two navy vessels to \"monitor the situation\", while the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French patrol vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety.\nFrance has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government.\nThe boats are protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.\nFrench authorities say \"new technical measures\" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them \"null and void\".\n\"It's really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that, if required, their licences can be amended,\" Senator Ian Gorst, Jersey's external relations minister, told BBC News.\n\"As I've said, it's important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy.\" \nJersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: \"They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters.\"\nAn Elys\u00e9e source said France was monitoring the situation \"very closely\", adding that it is \"currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case\".\n\"We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement.\"\nThe maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, were not on military missions.\nIt said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near to the fisherman in order to ensure safety.\nA European Commission spokeswoman said talks were continuing with the UK. \nBy Freddie Miller, BBC Jersey political reporter\nIn the darkness you could see the lights from boats slowly making their way from the direction of France towards Jersey. They then all gathered outside the St Helier harbour and they stayed there for about half an hour.\nAt about 06:30 BST they started making their way slowly into the harbour. Flares were set off - red flares, orange flares, burning bright. French flags were being flown, there were banners talking about fishing.\nMeanwhile, on the pier-side where I am, islanders had gathered - probably about 30 in total, including a couple of police officers. Jersey flags had been hung to the railings of the pier, some were waving flags.\nThere were also some Jersey boats in support of the French, flying both French and Jersey flags, and also a couple that were there trying to stop the French from coming into the harbour.\nAmidst all of this you've got the two navy vessels in the distance - you can just see the outline shadow of them through the mist, just keeping watch of everything.\nMEP Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a member of the EU fisheries committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said \"all retaliatory measures will be explored\".\nOf the threats to cut off electricity to Jersey, she said \"these are only words we are not ready for war\".\nOn Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would \"remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure\".\nA statement from the Jersey government read: \"Diplomatic efforts will continue to resolve the outstanding issues relating to fishing licences and to de-escalate the situation.\"\nTheir boats were draped with makeshift banners - which read \"en col\u00e8re\"- we are angry, writes BBC Europe correspondent Jean Mackenzie, who was with the fishermen as they set off from the French coast.\nA handful left this small port on the Normandy coast about 02:30, to be joined by dozens more on the way to Jersey. The fishermen seemed more shocked than angry, that their access to waters they have fished in for decades is being challenged.\nUnder the post-Brexit trade deal, Jersey has to allow European vessels into its waters, but they now need licences - but the fishermen say the permits have come with a long list of restrictions that were never agreed.\nReacting to the French maritime minister's threat to cut off Jersey's electricity in retaliation - the fishermen were pleased.\n\"It's good to know our country is on our side,\" they said\nDimitri Rogoff, head of fisheries for the Normandy region, said the boats would not try to block St Helier and would return to France in the afternoon, AFP reported.\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the threats were \"completely unreasonable\" and urged the UK government to \"get round the table with French colleagues and authorities in Jersey and sort this issue out\".\nFrench fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. \nUnder an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.\nJersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats were required to have a licence to operate there.\nOn Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located.\nBut the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that \"were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about\".\nChris Le Masurier, who runs Jersey Oyster and Normandy Trader Freight, said the French fisherman were rightly upset by the situation.\nHe said: \"I see it as very much an insult to them and they are extremely upset. The criteria that they were given was to prove they have fished in Jersey waters for 10 days. Nothing about what species were caught, nothing about if you've fished for 20 days or 30 days [and having to] prove that.\" \nBut Don Thompson, from the Jersey Fisherman's Association, said affected French crews have \"had since 1 January\" to comply with the new rules and \"perhaps some of the boats that perhaps didn't qualify are a little bit put-out\".\nThe threat to cut off Jersey's electricity supply - 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France - was made by French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin on Tuesday.\nHMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which are based in Portsmouth, are each crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines. \nThe ships are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks.\nUpdate: This story has been amended to clarify the specifications of Royal Navy vessels HMS Severn and HMS Tamar."

      "text": "UK travellers returning from \"red list\" countries are flying home via Turkey to avoid hefty hotel quarantine fees.\nPassengers are breaking their journey in Istanbul, and staying in hotels there for a fraction of the cost they would have to pay in Britain.\nTravellers from countries on the red list would otherwise face bills of up to \u00a31,750-per-person to isolate in a hotel if they flew to the UK directly.\nThose using the route must still quarantine at home once back in the UK.\nOne hotel worker in Istanbul said he had seen British nationals flying in from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh - which are all on the UK's red list.\nThe BBC has also spoken to travellers returning from Pakistan to the UK, many of whom were attending weddings or funerals and say they couldn't afford the cost of quarantining once the rules changed.\nAs long as they isolate at home for 10 days after returning from a non-red list country, they are not breaking the UK government's Covid rules.\nThe UK has a so-called red list with travel heavily restricted to countries on it - usually those with high coronavirus rates.\nAny British citizen arriving home who has been to a country on the list in the past 10 days must then pay to quarantine in a government-approved hotel.\nThe cost is \u00a31,750 for a single adult, while a family of four with teenage children would pay \u00a33,700. Guests are largely restricted to their rooms for the duration.\nBy comparison, anyone arriving in the UK from a country not on the list is told to self-isolate at home - so long as they've not been in a red list country in the past 10 days.\nOne travel agent in Bradford said some of his clients who had travelled to Pakistan had been left facing a hefty bill to return home after the country was placed on UK's banned list on 9 April. \n\"I've got customers who can't afford to come back,\" said Ascher Khawaja of Oltrax Travel, citing UK quarantine costs. To ease the burden on his clients, Mr Khawaja says he has arranged 15-20 journeys home via Turkey. \nThe country brought in a three-week lockdown last week because of rising infections - but it has not been added to the UK's red list. \"With the hotel factored in, it works out at around \u00a3600 compared to \u00a31,700-plus,\" he said. \nAnyone entering Turkey must have had a negative Covid test within 72 hours. They also must have a negative PCR test to leave the country. Foreign tourists are, however, exempt from Turkey's current lockdown rules. \nBradford businessman Mohammad Saad travelled to Pakistan on 23 March to attend his nephew's funeral and had been due to fly home on 10 April - the day after Pakistan was added to the red list. \nWhen he couldn't change his flights, he and his 16-year-old son flew to Turkey instead. The cost was about \u00a3450 for 10 days in Istanbul, he said.\n\"It's like an extra holiday. Then you can fly back into the UK from Istanbul without any hotel quarantine.\"\nHashir, a 21-year-old student returning from Pakistan, said he had met other Britons at the airport when he arrived in Istanbul.  \n\"There's no way I have that money, I'm a university student,\" said Hashir, referring to the cost of returning directly to the UK. He is due back in the UK on 7 May.\nZulfiqar Ali, a 45-year-old taxi driver from Leeds, travelled from Pakistan to Istanbul on 24 April. \"I paid \u00a3100 for 11 nights. It's a double bed, a TV and a fridge. It was online and food was very cheap.\"\nHe said he was returning to the UK on 5 May.\nThe BBC has also spoken to staff at hotels in Istanbul. One accommodation worker in the old city said British travellers were using the country as \"a bridge\".\nHis hotel had booked British passport holders travelling from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India - all on the red list, he said.\nTurkey has since tightened its rules on people arriving from India, who must now quarantine in designated dormitories.\nA manager at another hotel in the city said, through his membership of an international booking website, he could see there had been a rise in people travelling from Pakistan and India to Istanbul. \nBradford MP Naz Shah said others had been unable to book family rooms on the UK hotel quarantine booking system. She said she was \"deeply concerned\" about children potentially missing school because their parents can't afford to fly home.\nThe UK's Department for Transport said people who had not been in a red list country for the past 10 days were not prevented from entering the UK - but should isolate at home.\nIt said the rules were aimed at stopping people - other than British residents - entering the UK from red list countries.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Turkish Service."

      "tags": "India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "On Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country. \nAs he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk. \nThe chief doctor of one of the hospitals - a specialist paediatric facility - told the BBC that \"our hearts were in our mouths\" because of the risk of children dying. They got supplies just in time, after a local politician intervened. \nAnd yet, the federal government has repeatedly insisted that there was no shortage. \"We are only facing problems in its transportation,\" Piyush Goyal, a senior official from India's home ministry, said.\nHe also advised hospitals to \"ensure judicious use of oxygen as per the guidelines\". Several doctors who have spoken to the BBC say they are giving oxygen only to patients who need it, but there is not enough.\nBut experts say that the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems which shows both federal and state governments were not prepared, having failed to do enough to stop or minimise the damage of the second wave. \nWarnings have in fact been repeatedly issued, including:\nDespite this, on 8 March, the country's health minister announced that India was in the \"endgame of the pandemic\".\nSo, where did it go so wrong?\nIn January and February, the national number of daily cases fell to under 20,000 from peaks of around 90,000 in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Covid beaten, and all places of public gathering opened.\nAnd soon, people were not adhering to Covid safety protocols, thanks in part to confused messaging from the top.\nWhile Mr Modi asked people to wear masks and follow social distancing in his public messages, he addressed large unmasked crowds during his election campaigns in five states. A number of his ministers were also seen addressing large public gatherings without wearing masks. The Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival - which attracts millions - was also allowed to go ahead.\n\"There was complete disconnect between what they practised and what they preached,\" says public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya.\nProminent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says \"the government just did not see the second wave coming and started celebrating too early\". \nBut there is more to the story: the devastation has also exposed the underfunding and neglect of the public healthcare system in India. \nThe heart-breaking scenes that have been witnessed outside hospitals - people dying without getting treatment - shows the grim reality of India's healthcare infrastructure.\nAs one expert puts it, India's \"public health infrastructure was always broken, the rich and the middle class are just finding out\". Those who could afford it have always relied on private hospitals for treatment, while the poor struggle to get even a doctor's appointment.\nRecent schemes, like health insurance and subsidised medicines for the poor, are not helping because very little has been done in decades to increase the number of medical staff or hospitals.\nIndia's healthcare spending, including both private and public, has been around 3.6% of GDP for the past six years, the lowest percentage in the five Brics countries: Brazil spent the most at 9.2%, followed by South Africa at 8.1%, Russia at 5.3% and China at 5% in 2018.\nDeveloped nations spend a far higher proportion of their GDP on health.  In 2018, for instance, spending in the US was 16.9% and Germany 11.2%. Even smaller nations like Sri Lanka (3.76%) and Thailand (3.79%) spend more than India. \nAnd India has fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, and in some states the figure is less than five. \nSeveral \"empowered committees\" were last year looking at the preparations needed to tackle the next coronavirus wave, so experts are baffled by the shortages of oxygen, beds and drugs.\n\"When the first wave was tapering, that's when they should have prepared for a second wave and assumed the worst. They should have taken an inventory of oxygen and [the drug] remdesivir and then ramped up manufacturing capacity,\" Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra state, told the BBC.\nOfficials say India produces enough oxygen to meet the spike in demand but transportation was the problem. Experts say this should have been fixed much earlier. \nThe government is now running special trains carrying oxygen from one state to another and stopping use of oxygen in industries - but only after many patients died because of a lack of oxygen. \n\"The outcome has been that desperate family members are spending thousands of rupees to secure an oxygen cylinder on the black market and then stand for hours in a queue to get it filled,\" points out Dr Lahariya.\nMeanwhile, those who can afford it are also paying hefty amounts to procure drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab.\nAn executive from a pharmaceutical company which manufactures remdesivir said \"demand had dried up\" in January and February.  \"If the government had placed an order, we would have stockpiled and there wouldn't have been any shortage. We have ramped up production but demand has grown significantly,\" he said. \nIn contrast, the southern state of Kerala planned for the surge in advance. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of the state's Covid taskforce, says there was no shortage of oxygen in the state as necessary steps were taken in October last year.\n\"We also procured sufficient stock of remdesivir and tocilizumab and other drugs well in advance. We also have a surge plan in place to tackle any exponential rise in the numbers in the coming weeks,\" he says.\nMr Zagade says other states should have also taken similar steps \"to avoid the suffering\". \n\"Learning means someone else has done it and you can do it now, but that means it will take time,\" the former health secretary for Maharashtra said.\nBut time is running out as the second wave is now spreading to villages where healthcare systems are not equipped to deal with the surge.\nGenome sequencing of the virus is an important step in identifying new variants that could be more infectious and deadly. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up last year and it brought together 10 labs in the country.\nBut the group reportedly struggled to get funding initially. Virologist Dr Jameel says India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only \"properly started\" in mid-February 2021.\nIndia is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. \"In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,\" he said.\nHowever, India's main hope was always vaccination.\n\"Any public health specialist will tell you there is no practical way to strengthen an already broken public healthcare system in a matter of months,\" one woman, whose family runs a large private hospital in Delhi, told the BBC.  \n\"The best and most effective alternative to battle Covid was to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible so the majority wouldn't need hospital care and hence not overburden the healthcare system.\" \nIndia initially wanted 300 million people vaccinated by July, \"but it seems the government did not do enough planning to secure vaccine supply to run the programme\", Dr Lahariya says. \n\"On top of it, it has opened the vaccination for all adults without securing vaccine supplies.\" \nSo far, only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. India has millions more doses on order, but still far short of what it actually needs.\nThe federal government needs 615 million doses to vaccinate everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. There are 622 million people between the age of 18 and 44, and 1.2 billion doses are required to vaccinate them.\nThe government has also cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. \nThe government has enlisted other firms like Biological E and the state-run Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines. It has also given credit support of $609m to the Serum Institute of India, which produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab which is being made in India as Covishield, to ramp up production.\nBut that funding should have come earlier, Dr Lahariya says, saving precious lives. \"It will take months before we have enough vaccines to speed up the programme. In the meantime, millions will continue to be at risk of getting Covid,\" he adds.\nExperts say it is ironic that India is known as the world's pharmacy and it is now facing shortages of vaccines and drugs.\nAll of this, Dr Lahariya says, should serve as wake-up call for for both federal and state governments, which should invest drastically more in the healthcare sector because \"this definitely is not the last pandemic we will have to fight against\". \n\"The future pandemic may come earlier than any model can predict,\" he says."

Mali's government flew her there for specialist care.\n\"I'm very happy,\" her husband told the BBC. \"My wife and the babies [five girls and four boys] are doing well.\"\nA woman who had eight babies in the US in 2009 holds the Guinness World Record for the most children delivered at a single birth to survive.\nTwo sets of nonuplets have previously been recorded - one born to a woman in Australia in 1971 and another to a woman in Malaysia in 1999 - but none of the babies survived more than a few days.\nWorld record holder Nadya Suleman's octuplets have grown up and are now 12 years old. She conceived them through in vitro fertilisation.\nFanta Siby, Mali's health minister, congratulated the medical teams in Mali and Morocco for the \"happy outcome\".  \nProf Youssef Alaoui, medical director of the Ain Borja clinic in Casablanca where Ms Ciss\u00e9 gave birth, told the AFP news agency that the case was \"extremely rare, it's exceptional\" - and a team of 10 doctors and 25 paramedics had assisted at the delivery of the premature babies.\nThey weighed between 500g and 1kg (1.1lb and 2.2lb) and would be kept in incubators \"for two to three months\", he said.\nMs Ciss\u00e9's pregnancy became a subject of fascination in Mali - even when it was thought she was only carrying septuplets, Reuters news agency reports.\nDoctors in the West African nation had been concerned for her welfare and the chances of the babies' survival - so the government intervened.\nAfter a two-week stay in a hospital in Mali's capital, Bamako, the decision was made to move Ms Ciss\u00e9 to Morocco on 30 March, Dr Siby said.\nAfter five weeks at the Moroccan clinic, she gave birth by Caesarean section on Tuesday, the minister said. \nAccording to Prof Alaoui, Ms Ciss\u00e9 was 25 weeks pregnant when admitted and his team had managed to extend her term to 30 weeks.\nHer husband, Adjudant Kader Arby, is still in Mali with the couple's older daughter, but he says he has been in constant touch with his wife in Morocco and is not worried about the family's future.\n\"God gave us these children. He is the one to decide what will happen to them. I'm not worried about that. When the almighty does something, he knows why,\" he told BBC Afrique.\nHe says the family have been overwhelmed by the support they have received.\n\"Everybody called me! Everybody called! The Malian authorities called expressing their joy. I thank them\u2026 Even the president called me.\"\nAnalysis by Rhoda Odhiambo, BBC health reporter, Nairobi\nIt is very unusual for such pregnancies to occur naturally - often it is the result of fertility treatment - though we do not know if this happened in Ms Ciss\u00e9's case. \nBut gynaecologist Bill Kalumi, from Kenya's Kenyatta National Hospital, says they really only occur when this has been the case.\nThere are a range of reasons why fertility treatment is sought.\nBut most commonly in Africa fertility drugs are prescribed when a woman comes off a hormonal form of contraceptive as she can find that it takes a while to ovulate again, Dr Kalumi says.\nThis can then result in the release of several eggs, instead of one, during a woman's monthly cycle.\nMultiple births are risky for both mother and babies - and a woman who is found to be carrying more than four foetuses tends to be advised to reduce that number in countries where abortion is legal.\nMost pregnancies involving large numbers of babies end prematurely, as in Ms Ciss\u00e9's case.\nAnd premature babies - those born before 37 weeks - are at risk of developing problems as they have immature lungs and are prone to infections such as sepsis because of their weak immune system.\nLonger term, children born in multiples are also more likely to develop cerebral palsy - which affects movement."

      "text": "Nearly 40 UK food businesses have threatened to stop sourcing products from Brazil over proposed land reforms.  \nAn open letter from the group calls on Brazil's legislature to reject a bill which could legalise the private occupation of public land.\nThe letter said the proposal could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon. \nThe bill is being considered just months after Brazil pledged to end illegal logging.  \nSainsbury's, Aldi, Greggs, the Co-Op, the British Retail Consortium, and the Hilton Food Group are among the major organisations to sign the open letter.\nA vote in the Senate on  the bill is expected within days.\nThe companies say they \"consider the Amazon as a vital part of the earth system that's essential to the security of our planet, as well as being a critical part of a prosperous future for Brazilians and all of society.\"\nRainforests are critical to mitigating the effects of climate change, as they store vast amounts of carbon.\nUnder the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, the level of deforestation in the Amazon is reported as being the highest since 2008. \nThis year alone around 430,000 acres of the Amazon have been logged or burned, according to the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project.\nThe vast majority of land is cleared either to graze cattle for beef exports, or to grow soy, which goes in to animal feed around the world.\nAt a summit in April hosted by US President Joe Biden, Mr Bolsonaro declared that Brazil would end illegal logging. The letter says these measures \"run counter\" to this \"narrative and rhetoric.\"\nThe new law would allow land that has been illegally occupied after 2014 to be put up for sale. This would potentially allow illegal occupants to buy it. \nSimilar controversial measures were first put forward in a different bill last year, but were withdrawn after more than 40 organisations made the same threat over supply chain sourcing.\nThe group says the existing protections and land designations have been \"instrumental\" in their organisations having \"trust\" in Brazilian producers.\nThe companies say that the \"door remains open to work with Brazilian partners\" to develop sustainable land management practice in Brazil. \nHowever, if this or other measures that undermine existing protections become law, they will have \"no choice but to reconsider our support and use of the Brazilian agricultural commodity supply chain.\"\nCommenting on the imminent vote, Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF-UK, said: \"We cannot fight the climate crisis without the Amazon, yet its future hangs in the balance as deforestation pushes it closer to the point of collapse.\n\"If passed, this vote in the Brazilian Congress will fuel further destruction and place greater risk on the lives of the people and wildlife who call it home. \n\"As global efforts to protect the Amazon threaten to be undermined, it's encouraging to see major businesses sounding the alarm.\"\nCathryn Higgs, head of policy at the Co-op, said it was \"imperative\" the proposed legislation wasn't \"given any airtime by the Brazilian government.\"\nSupporters of the bill say it would help small-scale farmers to clarify title deeds to land. \nThe Brazilian government has been approached for comment.\nFollow Claire on Twitter"

      "text": "Debenhams has announced it will shut its remaining stores by 15 May, closing the door on more than 200 years of trade on UK high streets.\nThe move means 49 more shops will go, on top of the 52 due to close on 8 May. \nThe Debenhams brand will continue online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for \u00a355m in January.\nThe company traces its roots back to 1778 when William Clark opened a shop in London's West End, selling fabrics, bonnets and parasols.\nIn 1813, William Debenham invested in the firm and it was renamed Clark & Debenham.\nDebenhams has already announced that 52 shops will close on 8 May. The remaining sites will shut on either 12 May or 15 May. Some 12,000 workers will lose their jobs.\nIn 1950 Debenhams had the distinction of being the biggest department store in the UK with 110 stores.\nOver the years, Debenhams expanded at a rapid rate. In 2006 it announced plans to double its number of stores to 240 and was opening new shops as recently as 2017.\nHowever, the chain had struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April 2020.\nBut the coronavirus pandemic - which saw the enforced closure of non-essential retail outlets - proved to be the final blow for Debenhams and other rival retailers including Top Shop-owner Arcadia. \nBusinessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April of last year.\nHowever, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of \u00a3125m, was rejected as being too low.\nThen in December final hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder JD Sports withdrew.\nAdministrators announced they would start closing the remaining 124 stores, after the last ditch attempts at saving the business failed. \nThen in January Boohoo stepped in to buy the brand but not the shops, signalling the end of Debenhams on the High Street.\nAnnouncing the final closures, Debenhams said: \"Over the next 10 days, Debenhams will close its doors on the High Street for the final time in its 242 year history. \n\"We hope to see you all one last time in stores before we say a final goodbye to the UK High Street.\""

      "text": "Model and singer Nick Kamen has died at the age of 59, a friend of his family has confirmed to the BBC.\nThe Essex-born star was known for appearing in a 1985 Levi's advert filmed in a launderette.\nHis music career peaked the next year with a top five hit Each Time You Break My Heart, co-written by Madonna.\nHis friend and fellow singer Boy George led the tributes on Wednesday, describing Kamen as \"the most beautiful and sweetest man\".\nDuran Duran's John Taylor also paid tribute, remembering Kamen as \"one of the loveliest and gentlest men\" he had ever met.\nKamen - real name Ivor Neville Kamen - rose to fame in a jeans commercial, which showed him arrive at a launderette and strip down to his boxer shorts as several women looked on.\nThe advert, soundtracked by Marvin Gaye's I Heard It Through The Grapevine, helped to boost the company's denim sales and made him a sex symbol in the process.\nIt also caught the attention of the queen of pop, who told the BBC at the time she had been taken by Kamen's \"charisma\" and \"beautiful voice\".\nMadonna then contacted Kamen and asked him to record Each Time You Break My Heart - a synth-pop track left over from her third studio album True Blue - while she provided backing vocals.\nKamen's follow-up track, a cover of the Four Tops' Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever, peaked at number 16 in the UK singles chart but reached number one in Italy.\nHe topped the charts again in Italy with 1988's Tell Me, to which Madonna again provided backing vocals, and got to number one in Austria and Sweden with 1990's I Promised Myself.\nThe song, which Kamen wrote, was covered by Dead or Alive on their 2000 Fragile album and again by Swedish DJ Basshunter in 2009.\nSinger Judie Tzuke said she was \"so sad\" to hear of Kamen's death, saying that both he and his brother Barry - a model and stylist who died in 2015 - had \"gone far too soon\".\nFormer Grange Hill actor Ricky Simmonds said he had worked with Kamen at an early age and remembered him having \"the aura and charisma of a superstar\".\nSinger Tanita Tikaram also paid tribute, saying she had met him when she was starting out as they were signed to the same record label.\n\"He was kind & sweet [with] none of the ego of someone who had just set the world alight with his extraordinary beauty,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\"R.I.P Nick Kamen - beautiful inside and out,\" singer Kavana tweeted, while DJ Gary Crowley remembered him as \"a lovely, gentle guy\".\nKamen, who was born in Harlow in 1962, is understood to have died on Tuesday night after a long illness.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has turned our lives upside down over the last year and a bit - and it has done the same for this Senedd election campaign.\nPre-Covid, Welsh Labour had been in power for more than two decades and faced a defensive election trying to hold on to a number of marginal seats against opposition parties with the wind in their sails.  \nBefore the pandemic struck, few ordinary voters could have picked the Welsh Labour leader, Mark Drakeford, out of a line up.  \nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nSome of his own troops had misgivings about fighting an election under his understated, academic style of leadership, especially against the energetic and rhetorically gifted Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.\nPlaid's plan was to centre their campaign around Mr Price, confident that the contrast between the two men would get many centre left voters leaning in their favour.  \nThe Welsh Conservatives were feeling bullish after dismantling Labour's red wall in the north east of Wales in the 2019 General Election, but their leader, Paul Davies, was a quiet man struggling to make his mark.\nFast forward to April 2021 and a very different political world. \nIn this world, Mark Drakeford is a well-known figure. He has a better recognition than the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - an unprecedented event in a devolved election.\nThis presents obvious problems for Plaid's campaign - how does Adam Price outshine an incumbent who, polls suggest, gets good approval ratings for his handling of the pandemic even among Plaid's own supporters?\nAfter the \"drinking in the Senedd\" episode the Welsh Conservatives now have Andrew RT Davies at the helm. \nHe is better known than Paul Davies, but faces the same challenge - how to motivate those who voted Tory in 2019 to do the same again in 2021? \nTraditionally, Welsh Conservative supporters are less likely to vote in Senedd elections - but the party has deployed UK big hitters, most notably the prime minister to enthuse their base. \nHave they succeeded or have the allegations swirling around Boris Johnson had an impact?\nBut some things haven't changed.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats are still fighting to hold onto their one Senedd seat in Brecon and Radnorshire, while Welsh Labour's defensive challenge remains.\nThe margins in some key seats are wafer thin and the \"time for change\" narrative employed by Plaid and the Tories could be a powerful one after 22 years of Labour in the post-devolution driving seat. \nSo while none of the main parties are fighting the campaign they planned for, there is still a lot at stake.\nEven in this most unusual of election campaigns, it's still the voters who decide the result. \nAnd that poses one final question.\nAfter 14 months which have made us realise like never before the power of the Welsh government over our lives, what will happen to turnout?\nUp to now, voter turnout has never broken 50% in devolved elections.\nPerhaps Covid will change that too."

      "text": "Bumper ballots, Super Thursday, Election extravaganza.\nWhatever you want to call the votes tomorrow, there will be millions and millions of them, in a sweeping set of elections. \nThere are national polls in Scotland and Wales for the Holyrood Parliament and the Senedd. Council elections across England, from the tiniest parish to huge powerful authorities, 39 ballots for police and crime commissioners, 13 directly elected mayors and the London Assembly too. \nIt's a strange set of elections, after a year when the country has been in and out of lockdown, putting politics and much other business as usual on hold. \nGovernment at all levels has been grappling with a health and an economic emergency and while pollsters have been busy number crunching, there are plenty of races that are very hard to predict. \nAnd the votes will matter in many ways, from who collects the bins in Derbyshire to the future of the whole UK. \nFirst off, deciding who controls councils in England is an important job for voters. Councils are in charge of how the elderly are looked after, how late pubs on your high street can open, planning, the bins (of course), to name just a few.  \nLocal government has huge influence over our lives in lots of ways. City mayors also have a growing role in the UK, whether it's what seems to have become the Labour fiefdom of London, or Tory mayor on Teesside. \nThe individual contests matter for our quality of life, but make a difference to political sentiment too. At this stage of an electoral cycle, where one party has been in charge nationally for more than 10 years, the Tories in this case, the oppositions should be gobbling up seats all over the place. \nBut having changed its leader twice, and hung on through a political rollercoaster, it just doesn't seem like that's set to happen. Indeed, the broader question for the two main parties might be about geography rather than number of places that really change hands. \nCan the Tories keep up their momentum in areas the Labour Party used to rely on? Can Labour, after Jeremy Corbyn, stop the electoral rot? \nFor political nerds, a by-election in Hartlepool too provides a very convenient example of this big test. The current formation of the seat has never been held by the Tories. If they can grab it from Labour now, it suggests their vote in 2019 with dozens of new seats turning blue was not a fluke. \nIf Keir Starmer's team can't hold it, mutterings about his ability to reverse the trend will get louder. (It's important to note, though, in 2019 the Brexit Party received more than 10,000 votes in that constituency - this makes it harder this time for Labour than less recent history might suggest.) \nThe elections in Wales, where notably 16 and 17-year-olds will vote for the first time, seem unlikely to produce what would be the first majority in the Senedd for any party. \nBut the experience of the pandemic has demonstrated the powers and profile of its devolved government. Results will be watched closely there to see if that tips the balance.\nThe most keenly anticipated decisions though will be those made by Scottish voters. The SNP has been far and away the dominant force at Holyrood for many years. The real potential prize for Nicola Sturgeon this time round would be for the party to win a majority on its own. \nHer backers believe that would give the SNP a convincing mandate to hold another independence referendum, something that Boris Johnson right now has the legal power to refuse and, indeed, says that he would block. \nBut some unionists fear meeting an outright majority with a brick wall would not be possible for long. Yet with internal spats and the dramatic moves of the former leader Alex Salmond, the SNP's armour-plated unity has taken a fair few knocks. \nAnd with many Scottish races extremely close, the outcome is hard to predict. But this week could see the start of many months of fraught fights, even court cases, over the future of the Union where once again, politics in the whole UK becomes tangled up in arguments about the constitutional status quo. \nIt is important to remember as the results come in that these elections are complicated. They capture one moment in time, they don't make the next steps inevitable. And voters, of course, vote different ways in different contests. \nThis time, however, the long list of different contests will make an overall picture even harder to draw. \nOne insider described them as a 'spinners dream' - there will be so much going on that each party afterwards will have evidence from somewhere to try to create its own headline. \nEach result will give us a jigsaw piece to try to create a pattern, but this time, not every piece will even be taken from the same box.

On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nJess Blair of the Electoral Reform Society said the low registration figures were \"disappointing but sadly unsurprising\".\n\"Despite a major civil society push, thousands have fallen through the gaps,\" she said.\n\"The Senedd election will see a historic chance for young people to have their say. It's critical that everyone turns out to vote next week.\"\nWhile campaigning may traditionally be associated with knocking doors and posting leaflets, this year grime artists, fitness stars, and Instagram and TikTok influencers have been weighing in.\nA group led by young people in Cardiff have been trying to get teenagers to vote by talking on social media about why their vote counts.\nIn the past few months, more than 10,000 clicks have gone through from the videos, created by Citizens Cymru Wales, to the voter registration website.\nHowever, the campaigners said they felt young people were not being listened to by politicians and parties had not done enough to reach potential new voters.\nNadila Hussein, 20, said she did not believe any of the main political parties had engaged effectively with young people during the campaign.\nThe politics student at Cardiff University, who is a member of the Labour party, said: \"It was just young people, living in their own areas, just thinking, we have this responsibility to get our peers voting.\n\"It's our futures, it's our lives, we had to pick up the mantle.\"\nShe said recent climate change and Black Lives Matter protests showed young people cared and wanted to see change.\n\"The passion is there... but I think the onus is now on parties and the government to find a way to apply that so that young people are going to be engaged in local politics,\" she said.\nKirstie Edwards, 26, said many young people may not have registered to vote as they were either not aware, or did not think their vote mattered.\nShe said leaflets and TV adverts had not felt like they were aimed at her, and politicians had a \"responsibility\" to engage young people, especially those who may not have friends or family who were politically engaged.\n\"It's a momentous moment for young voices to be heard,\" she said.\n\"Politics isn't just for one type of group, it's for everyone... we hope that from doing videos with our influencers, the 16 to 17-year-olds who have got the opportunity to vote can do so with confidence their voice matters.\"\nMegan Gillard, from Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she had always considered herself a political person but \"never felt I had the power to do something\".\nThe 18-year-old, involved in a project about voting by the National Youth Theatre of Wales, said with coronavirus there had been little opportunity in schools for education about the importance of democracy.\n\"I had to do a lot of learning on my own and a lot of young people struggle with that,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\nWhile thousands of young people may have registered to vote it may not mean they actually turn up to cast a ballot on the day.\nTurnout for Welsh elections is lower than for the UK Parliament, with just 45.3% of all eligible voters casting a vote at the 2016 poll.\nIn the Brexit referendum 71.1% in Wales cast a ballot, while at the last general election in 2019, 66.6% voted.\nExperts say it is unclear how the Covid pandemic might change numbers voting, with different lockdown rules highlighting differences between the UK and Welsh governments.\nRoger Awan-Scully of Cardiff University said he feared the turnout could be \"exceptionally low\" - with most attention on the pandemic.\nHe said it could be similar to the vote in 2003, during the Iraq war, when turnout fell to the lowest ever for a Welsh election, at 38.3%.\n\"With everything going on, it's possible that turnout could be really low... but on the other hand we have seen in some elections, globally, in the last year, we have seen some very healthy turnouts,\" he said.\n\"There are arguments it could be relatively high... it's certainly brought home to people that devolution is a reality and something that directly affects them.\n\"However, I'm increasingly inclined to be pessimistic about turnout... maybe some 16 and 17-year-olds simply won't take part, but it could actually be that a lot of older voters may not actually end up taking part either.\"\nProf Awan-Scully said the challenges of campaigning during a pandemic had meant parties had not really changed their campaigns to reflect the potential influx of young voters.\n\"In more normal times I am sure there probably would have been a bit more headspace to focus on the additional teenaged voters... but I think this has been squeezed by the circumstances of the pandemic,\" he said."

      "text": "Israel's president has asked the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, Yair Lapid, to try to form a government.\nReuven Rivlin announced that he had given Mr Lapid the mandate after long-time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to meet an overnight deadline.\nYesh Atid came second to Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party in March's inconclusive general election.\nMr Lapid faces a challenge to bridge the ideological differences between the parties he can ask to join a coalition.\nIf he fails to secure a majority in the 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, there is a risk of the country having to go to elections for the fifth time in two years. \nIn a televised address on Wednesday evening, President Rivlin said he had decided to give Mr Lapid a 28-day mandate to form a government after 56 lawmakers expressed support for his candidacy.\n\"From the number of recommendations, it is clear that Yair Lapid could form a government that has the confidence of the Knesset, despite there being many difficulties,\" he added.\nHe noted that Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Yamina party, which has seven seats, had called for a stable government and not ruled out the possibility of joining a coalition with Mr Lapid. \nMansour Abbas, the head of the Arab Islamist party Raam, which has four seats, had meanwhile stated that he would \"co-operate positively\" with anyone given a mandate, he added.\nIn a statement after the announcement, Mr Lapid promised to do everything he could to form a government as soon as possible.\n\"After two years of political paralysis, Israeli society is hurting. A unity government isn't a compromise or a last resort - it's a goal, it's what we need,\" he said.\n\"We need a government that will reflect the fact that we don't hate one another. A government in which left, right and centre will work together to tackle the economic and security challenges we face. A government that will show that our differences are a source of strength, not weakness.\"\nThe 57-year-old former finance minister has previously said that he would be prepared to share the premiership with Mr Bennett as part of a rotation agreement, with the latter leading the country for the first two years.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr Bennett called for the formation of a \"broad emergency government\" that would \"get the wheel out of the mud\".\n\"This is the time to stop and reconsider a new path. Whoever cynically takes the State of Israel to fifth elections based on personal interests, in complete opposition to the needs of the nation and state, the people won't forgive him.\" \nLikud, which controls 30 seats, blamed the prime minister's failure to form a coalition before the deadline ended at midnight on Mr Bennett's \"refusal to commit to a right-wing government\".\nMr Netanyahu told his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and defence minister on Monday that he would be willing to hand over the premiership to him for one year. But Mr Bennett dismissed the proposal, saying that even with Yamina's support Mr Netanyahu would still be two seats short of a majority.\nThe far-right Religious Zionism alliance had also ruled out joining a coalition supported by Raam, which was open to working with Mr Netanyahu to address the needs of Israel's Arab citizens.\nA long period of political stalemate in Israel has been complicated by Mr Netanyahu's ongoing trial for corruption, which he denies. His rivals argue he should not remain in office while facing criminal charges.\nThe 71-year-old is Israel's longest-serving leader, having led five governments since 1996. The last, which saw him share power with the then-main opposition party to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic, collapsed in December, triggering the latest election."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has laid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 July and roll out the shots for 12- to 15-year-olds as soon as possible.\nMr Biden's new goal includes having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by Independence Day. \nThe target is well within reach as 105 million have already had the required jabs, and the US is vaccinating nearly a million adults per day.\nBut the vaccination rate is half of what it was just three weeks ago.\nMr Biden said his administration was working to win over \"doubters\" about the shots.\nIsrael - a world leader in vaccination rates - has nearly fully reopened its economy and seen its number of new coronavirus cases crash to almost zero, with just over 60% of the population having received at least one shot.\nHerd immunity happens when enough of a population has protection against an infection that it stops being able to spread - and even people who don't themselves have immunity are indirectly protected. \nFor Covid the estimated threshold for herd immunity is at least 65%-70% of people having protection against infection, although Mr Biden's chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci has increased his estimate to 90% and the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the level is not known.\nMr Biden said at the White House on Monday: \"In two months let's celebrate independence as a nation and our independence from this virus. We can do this. We will do this.\"\nThe Democratic president also announced a new website, vaccines.gov, that Americans can use to more easily find vaccination sites after widespread complaints that the sign-up process was too difficult for some.\nThere is also a phone number Americans can now text to submit their postal code and learn about vaccination sites in their area.\nMr Biden had previously set the goal for life to be \"back to normal\" by 4 July. \nThe US Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to approve the Pfizer vaccine for children as young as 12.\nPfizer's vaccine is currently approved in the US for people as young as 16. \nMr Biden said he would not interfere with the FDA process but \"if that announcement comes, we are ready to move immediately\".\nThe president told reporters vaccines would be sent directly to paediatricians in the following weeks \"so parents and their children can talk to their family doctor about it and get the shot from the provider they trust the most. Easy, fast and free.\"\nHe added that 15,000 pharmacies would also be made available to teenagers to get their jab.\n\"And if teens are on the move this summer they can get their first shot in one place and get their second shot elsewhere,\" he added.\nIf approved, the vaccine will immediately become available to some 17 million teenagers aged 12 to 15.\nDr Fauci has said children will probably need to be vaccinated in order for life to return to normal.\nWith 75% of American seniors now fully vaccinated, rates of infections have increased in unvaccinated children, a study suggests.\nAccording to the research released on Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children in states that count Covid cases by age now make up around 22.4% of all new infections. That's up significantly from 3% of new daily cases at this point last year, the study found.\nMr Biden also said he was speaking to US businesses to announce shopping discounts for vaccinated Americans.\n\"We're working with major sports leagues to launch special promotions for their fans. Things like ticket giveaways, in-stadium vaccinations, discounts on merchandise and other creative ways to make it easier and more fun to get vaccinated,\" he said.\nSeveral US companies have already offered rewards for the vaccinated.\nIt is not clear what the threshold for herd immunity is for Covid. Dr Fauci began by saying the number was around 70% before ratcheting the figure gradually upwards to 90%.\nHe acknowledged in a New York Times interview in December having moved the goalposts in response to public polling on Americans' willingness to get a vaccine. Dr Fauci last month said the target of herd immunity was \"elusive\".\nThe World Health Organization's chief scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, has said: \"The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against Covid-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known.\" "

The remaining sites will shut on either 12 May or 15 May. Some 12,000 workers will lose their jobs.\nIn 1950 Debenhams had the distinction of being the biggest department store in the UK with 110 stores.\nOver the years, Debenhams expanded at a rapid rate. In 2006 it announced plans to double its number of stores to 240 and was opening new shops as recently as 2017.\nHowever, the chain had struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April 2020.\nBut the coronavirus pandemic - which saw the enforced closure of non-essential retail outlets - proved to be the final blow for Debenhams and other rival retailers including Top Shop-owner Arcadia. \nBusinessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April of last year.\nHowever, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of \u00a3125m, was rejected as being too low.\nThen in December final hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder JD Sports withdrew.\nAdministrators announced they would start closing the remaining 124 stores, after the last ditch attempts at saving the business failed. \nThen in January Boohoo stepped in to buy the brand but not the shops, signalling the end of Debenhams on the High Street.\nAnnouncing the final closures, Debenhams said: \"Over the next 10 days, Debenhams will close its doors on the High Street for the final time in its 242 year history. \n\"We hope to see you all one last time in stores before we say a final goodbye to the UK High Street.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

However, we are also conscious that there is still great uncertainty surrounding international travel.\"\nThe British Normandy Memorial, designed by UK architect Liam O'Connor, records the names of the 22,442 servicemen and women under British command who fell on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\nThe memorial, which cost almost \u00a330m, overlooks Gold Beach, one of three where British forces landed to begin the liberation of western Europe from Germany.\nIt was funded by the government, private donations and fundraising efforts of people like D-Day veteran Harry Billinge, who was appointed MBE for raising more than \u00a325,000 towards it.\nThe 94-year-old from St Austell, Cornwall, said he was \"overwhelmed\" by the memorial and \"had tears in my eyes\".\n\"When I collect money for that memorial, I get a great calmness over me,\" he said. \"I lost a lot of good men, young men.\"\nAnother fundraiser was Harry Salmon, who raised thousands through a sponsored bike ride through northern France. His father, also called Harry, was among those killed in the conflict.\n\"I saw veterans being interviewed on television and I found it really hard to see them shedding tears taking about their fallen comrades,\" he said. \n\"My father was a team player, these were his team mates. They were shedding tears for him.\"\nHe visited the site during his bike ride and said it was \"an incredible piece of architecture\".\nD-Day, codenamed Operation Overlord, was a massive assault by the allies to invade Nazi-occupied western Europe and saw 156,000 soldiers from Britain, US, Canada and France land on the beaches of Normandy.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Wealthy countries including the UK should send spare vaccine doses to virus-hit nations before organising booster jabs, a World Health Organization (WHO) official has said.\nSpecial envoy David Nabarro told the BBC top-ups and extra vaccinations \"should come a bit later\".\nHe said Covid was \"bigger than ever, it's fiercer than ever and it's causing more distress than ever\" worldwide.\nThe UK has said its booster programme could start as early as September.\nThe government has also pledged to donate surplus vaccine doses to poorer nations.\nBut the WHO has urged richer countries to do more - and sooner - as Covid cases surge in countries, including India and South Asian nations.\nMr Nabarro told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the virus was now spreading in places where testing was poor - so the numbers being reported risked being a \"major under-estimate\".\n\"This is a bad phase,\" he said.\nAs foreign ministers of the G7 group of countries met in London, he urged leaders to begin to distribute spare doses to those countries in the grip of the virus amid a global shortage of supply.\nHe said he wanted \"to plead with G7 leaders, with G20 leaders, with every leader, with everybody who's got influence, to please recognise that we've got to try to get vaccines distributed to those who need them the most now in this period of acute shortage of supply\".\nMr Nabarro added that \"top-ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries... should come a bit later\".\nIt comes after UK Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said extra funding would fast-track new vaccines to \"future-proof\" the UK against new virus variants.\nExisting vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps on mutating. \nMr Zahawi said the \u00a329.3m funding increase would improve testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory.\nHe also said the booster programme could begin in September \"or later in the year, or early next year\".\nHe told BBC Breakfast clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme.\nLast week, the UK government ordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters.\nFollowing the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years.\"\nUK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: \"A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. \n\"This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants.\n\"While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops.\" \nThe government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered.\nProf Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said new variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic.\n\"In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country.\"\nProf Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored \"carefully\", but the UK had gone from a \"terrible situation\" in January to a \"remarkably good situation now\".\nCovid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.\nOn Wednesday, the UK reported another 2,144 daily cases, as well as a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe government's latest data showed more than 50 million Covid vaccinations have been given in the UK so far, with more than 34.7 million first doses and 15.8 million second doses administered."

      "text": "These Senedd elections are not the ones we anticipated and there's a strange contradictory feel to them. \nIt's been a low-key campaign which has scarcely dazzled, yet the results on Friday feel more significant than ever. \nThe Members of the Senedd - or MSs - elected will serve in a proper parliament with law-making and tax setting powers. \nAdded excitement comes from the very tight margins that will decide at least a quarter of the constituency seats and several regional list seats. \nSmall shifts in votes could determine the distribution of seats to parties and therefore the shape of our next Welsh government. \nSo, the final results are unpredictable, dependent as they are on several important unknowns. \nFirst, this is a Covid election - both practically and policy wise. \nWe are edging out of lockdown, but with gargantuan recovery problems ahead. \nMost of us had imagined a dramatically different political landscape for Senedd 2021, framed by post-Brexit adaptation not a pandemic.\nThen there's turnout: I called devolution Wales' 'dirty little secret' as no election has generated a turnout of above 50%, impacting on Senedd credibility and legitimacy. \nIt should be higher this time, but who knows as we ease out of lockdown restrictions. \nIt's also less about the raw percentage figure and more about who actually goes out to vote that matters - this time more than ever, with such small margins deciding many seats. \nWhilst the overall votes are likely to be split relatively evenly between the three big parties, Wales's semi-hybrid - and increasingly dysfunctional - electoral system benefits the largest party whilst offering opportunities for the smaller parties on the regional list. \nAttention will be on whether Welsh Labour can win an overall majority (and no party's ever achieved this) or has to govern alongside Plaid Cymru, with or without a formal coalition.\nWhat about the other 'c's - credibility and the constitution?\nThe BBC Leaders' Debate last week was not a dial shifter, but it did expose parties on the campaigning front and back foot. \nVoters will also have been able to judge the credibility of the main contenders for first minister. \nWelsh Labour's campaigning has been all about packing its defence and playing up its sure footed Covid handling. \nThe party's had least need to adapt, keeping the push on its track record of delivery, competence and trust. \nLabour has been in power for all of devolution's 22 years and the most (small 'c') conservative and successful political party in Wales (there's a lesson there) is running on a platform of carrying on with what it's doing. \nIt has been helped by the fact that Mark Drakeford has become an electoral asset, newly recognised and mostly popular, an avuncular \"safe pair of hands\".\nAmongst the Welsh-identifying, centre-left part of the electorate, Covid handling is not a particularly promising route to criticise the Labour government.\nBluntly, this impacts Plaid Cymru most. \nPlaid's intention to make the case for the removal of Mark Drakeford was wrecked by Covid. \nVoters appear ensconced in national identity \"tribes\" with limited crossover between them. \nWelsh Labour and Plaid currently share the same tribal identity - but Labour is clearly dominant. \nPlaid's planned presidential campaign had its charismatic leader, Adam Price front and centre but its hopes of replacing Welsh Labour \u00e0 la SNP were shattered by the way Welsh public opinion realigned over Covid.\nIt's fair to say that Welsh Labour has ridden its luck in Senedd elections, not least in 2016 when it clung on to many seats in what became known as the 'Red Wall' - often by very small margins, a good way of describing this is as a very efficient votes to seats won ratio! \nThis time, seats like Llanelli, Wrexham, Brecon and Radnorshire, Gower, Delyn, Rhondda, Vale of Clwyd, Caerphilly and Vale of Glamorgan are all interesting for different reasons. \nStill, due to the inbuilt compensatory mechanism of our electoral system, Labour would have to lose several constituency seats in the south, including some in the valleys to Plaid, not to be the largest party on 7 May.\nThe problem for the Tories is that it's not as straightforward as getting out the half a million Welsh voters who supported them in 2019. \nThat was a UK election, all about getting Brexit done - and \"done\" it is in most people's minds. \nWe know that many in the 'Red Wall' were not necessarily natural Tories and there's long been plenty of voter mobility in Wales. \nAndrew RT Davies' populist style might well capture some of UKIP's sizeable vote last time around, but that might be too dispersed to help the Welsh Conservatives win many of their targets. \nBefore recent events at Downing Street, the Welsh Conservatives were in bullish mood. \nThey will still likely make some seat gains but what currency will these have given Davies has effectively ruled out all feasible routes to governing? \nStill, winning some of its plausible Labour-held targets would probably seal the results day narrative and surely be noticed at UK level given the potential implications for both Johnson and Starmer.\nDespite plenty of interest in the topic from media far and wide, this is not an independence election. \nNevertheless, strong support for independence amongst young voters - especially with 16- and 17-year-olds now on the electoral roll - and amongst Labour supporters might prove critical if a mandate for Indy Ref 2 is delivered in Scotland. \nIf Plaid plays the long game, this could prove significant. \nAdam Price ruled out most realistic coalitions early doors, but his party's best hope now is for a last-minute surge in support in a couple of key constituencies, along with picking up a couple of extra regional list seats. \nIf Labour doesn't manage to ride its luck twice - and its 2016 results represent a high bar after all- this would mean some fascinating negotiations over the shape of our next government."

MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits.\nThe referendum in 2014 - which saw voters in Scotland reject independence by 55% to 45% - was formally approved by the UK government, with both it and the Scottish government pledging to respect the result. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has so far refused to grant the same consent for another vote on the issue, arguing that the 2014 referendum had settled the question for a generation.\nAnd some within the independence movement - including former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond, who now leads the Alba Party - have called on Ms Sturgeon to set out an alternative path to independence if the PM's stance does not change.\nAnd there have been suggestions that a referendum could be held without the UK government's approval - similar to the disputed vote in Catalonia in 2017.\nThe SNP manifesto says it wants to hold a referendum after the pandemic ends - with Ms Sturgeon not ruling out going to court to settle the question of whether Holyrood could legislate for a legal referendum without Westminster's backing.\nThe striking thing about the early stages of this debate was that when you get away from the constitutional faultlines, these parties actually have a lot in common.\nThe leaders all broadly agreed about taking a cautious route out of the Covid-19 lockdown, and all seem to be planning a \"staycation\" this year rather than international travel.\nAll want to commit more money to health and care services - and none of them want to raise income taxes to do it.\nThey are still politicians, so there were digs aplenty, but there were also lots of \"I agree with...\" moments - even between Patrick Harvie and Douglas Ross, who are not usually exactly chummy.\nSo there is plenty of common ground between the parties - but it tends to be forgotten when the debate swings to independence, and that was predictably the section where the \"no talking over each other\" rule went out the window.\nRead more about Phil's five key \"takeaways\" from Tuesday night's debate. \nBut Mr Ross claimed: \"Nicola Sturgeon has been clear. If she gets a majority, she'll take her eye off the ball for Scotland's recovery, for rebuilding the country from the pandemic, and seek to hold another independence referendum.\n\"She will ask for a Section 30 order - which the prime minister has said is absolutely the wrong thing to do right now in the middle of this global pandemic - and seek to divide the country all over again.\"\nHe said that, when the prime minister refused her request, Ms Sturgeon would \"go ahead with an illegal wildcat referendum\" - pointing to previous comments made by SNP MP Richard Thomson, who said the Scottish government would \"simply go ahead with a referendum\" if formal consent is refused. \nUse our concise manifesto guide to compare where the parties stand on key issues like Covid-19, independence and the environment.\nThe televised debate also featured the leaders of the three other parties who are represented in the Scottish Parliament.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Mr Ross was the \"gift that keeps on giving\" for the SNP and claimed he was \"only interested in saving his skin, not saving the union\". \nAnd he said it was \"not credible\" for Ms Sturgeon to lead the country through the recovery from the pandemic, while also leading a referendum campaign.\nMr Sarwar added: \"I do not support a referendum, I don't support independence and I want people to choose something different. \n\"I want them to choose us to focus on a national recovery in the next parliament.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said people would be \"bemused\" that party leaders were debating independence in the wake of one of deepest pandemics the country has ever faced.\nMr Rennie said: \"The people who are waiting an age for mental health treatment I think deserve better than this, the people who are desperate for a job deserve better than this.\"\nAnd he later added: \"Despite the fact that it has been the policy of the SNP for generations, they still don't know what the currency would be\" in an independent Scotland.\nBut Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the possibility of an independent Scotland would allow the country to shape a more radical future.\nHe added: \"I don't think we can afford to pass up the opportunity to shape our own recovery. This is a moment of incredible opportunity to decide what kind of country is going to emerge from Covid.\"\nBut Mr Harvie and Ms Sturgeon disagreed over what currency an independent Scotland should use - with the Greens co-leader saying plans for a separate Scottish currency should begin \"immediately\" after a vote for independence.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said Scotland would continue to use the pound \"for as long as necessary\" after independence.\nThe debate also saw the five party leaders face questions on topics including the possible easing of foreign travel restrictions, the future of the social care sector, taxation and plans for a new \u00a3200m Royal Yacht.

      "tags": "Telford,Birmingham,West Mercia Police",
      "text": "Two police officers \"colluded\" in their account of what happened after the death of an ex-footballer, a court has heard.\nPC Benjamin Monk is on trial charged with murdering former Aston Villa star Dalian Atkinson in Telford in 2016.\nProsecutors claim he and PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, who is charged with assault, used excessive force. Both deny the charges.\nMr Atkinson was Tasered, kicked and hit with a baton, the jury heard.\nProsecutors at Birmingham Crown Court said the similarity of the officers' accounts was \"indicative\" they had discussed how \"to account for their unlawful attack on an unarmed man\".\nMr Atkinson, 48, died in the early hours of 15 August 2016 after the officers responded to reports of him acting erratically outside his father's house in Meadow Close, Telford.\nJurors heard Mr Atkinson had ripped out his dialysis line shortly before he was confronted by the officers.\nOn Tuesday, the court was told Mr Atkinson, who also played for Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday, was Tasered for 33 seconds - six times longer than is standard - and had been kicked at least twice in the head by PC Monk, leaving the imprint of bootlaces.\nMr Atkinson later died from cardio-respiratory arrest.\nProsecutor Alexandra Healy QC said both officers had been interviewed under caution on 26 August 2016, and in January 2017.\nPC Monk, 42, had said the officers arrived to hear a \"large row\" and Mr Atkinson's behaviour made him \"fearful for himself, his partner and whoever was in the property\".\nMr Atkinson was said to answer the door in \"a rage\" and claiming to be the Messiah, and when presented with the Taser said, 'I am going to take you to the gates of hell',\" Ms Healy said. \nAfter two Taser cartridges had failed, a third one was successfully deployed and left Mr Atkinson unconscious.\nPatrick Gibbs QC, defending PC Monk, said the officer believed Mr Atkinson was trying to get up.\nMr Gibbs said the officer did not dispute kicking the ex-footballer twice in the head, but did so while he was \"terrified\".\nRichard Smith QC, PC Bettley-Smith's barrister, said the 31-year-old maintained her use of the baton was \"lawful\", adding: \"She genuinely believed, in the heat of the moment, in the circumstances she found herself in, that the use of that baton was necessary and reasonable.\"\nEarlier that night, Mr Atkinson had been acting out of character, his partner Karen Wright said, and had borrowed her car to drive to his father's house. \nIt followed a few weeks where he was \"quite convinced that he was going to be killed\" either by the NHS or police, she said.\nShe rang him at about 01:30 BST, at which time Mr Atkinson was at his father's home. \nAsked if she could hear anything else, Ms Wright said: \"I heard the sound of the door opening and then a third voice and then Dalian left the phone on, and I could hear him say 'do you know who you're speaking to?'.\n\"It wasn't to me, it was to somebody else.\"\nThe call then went dead, she said. \nBarbara Wynne, a neighbour of Mr Atkinson's father, who gave evidence to the hearing, had called 999 after she and her husband Mark were awoken by a \"car horn\" and vehicle lights.\nIn a recording of the call, played to court, she was heard telling the operator: \"I'm not sure what actually happened but I just heard some noise... there's a car pulled up outside an old man's house and there's somebody shouting.\n\"Then he went back to his car, then went back to the door - kicked it.\n\"And he said to the bloke 'you better let me in'.\"\nShe told the operator \"the bloke seemed scared\", adding: \"He's gone in - I'm a little worried.\"\nThe court also heard a pathologist had examined Mr Atkinson's injuries but \"no typical defence wounds\" were noted to his hands or forearms.\nA pathologist recorded a narrative cause of death, Ms Healy told the court, which found Mr Atkinson died due to cardio-respiratory arrest, \"close in time to the deployment of Taser, followed by a brief period of restraint and blunt force trauma\".\nAll three of the prosecution's medical experts, the court heard, agreed that while Mr Atkinson's enlarged heart meant that he could have died at any time, the prolonged period of Tasering and the kicks to his head made a \"significant contribution\" to his death.\nMs Wright, who had been in a relationship with Mr Atkinson for eight years, said he was due to check in to a hospital the following day for treatment and that night had pulled out a dialysis line in agitation. \nMr Gibbs told jurors the medical evidence in this case was \"multi factorial\" and possibly \"the most medically complex forensic pathology case\" the pathologist had dealt with.\nConcluding her opening speech, Ms Healy said the jury would have to consider whether PC Monk had intended to cause really serious injury.\n\"The prosecution say that once that last Taser deployment had been totally effective, causing Dalian Atkinson to fall to the ground as a result of neuromuscular incapacitation... the officers were no longer acting in self-defence,\" she said. \n\"Rather they acted in anger as a result of the fear that Dalian Atkinson had just put them through.\nPC Monk denies murder as well as an alternative charge of manslaughter. PC Bettley-Smith denies assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The white former Minneapolis police officer convicted last month of the murder of the black man George Floyd has requested a new trial. \nDerek Chauvin's legal team have filed court documents alleging misconduct by both prosecutors and jurors.  \nChauvin, who was captured on video kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, was found guilty of murder and manslaughter. \nHis lawyer says his client was deprived of a fair trial.  \nThe rare verdict against a police officer was considered a milestone in the racial history of the US and was widely applauded by Americans. Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison.  \nHe will be sentenced next month.\nUS media report that the request for a new trial was expected and is a common move following a conviction.\nThe New York Times quoted experts as saying it was unlikely that the jury's decision would be overturned because of the evidence in the case.\nIn court documents Eric Nelson argues that the process was not impartial because of pre-trial publicity.  \nHe writes that it was \"so pervasive and so prejudicial\" before and during the trial, that it amounted to a \"structural defect in the proceedings\". \nThe motion also alleges that errors were made by the judge and that there was prosecutorial misconduct and witness intimidation. \nSupporters of Chauvin have pointed to juror Brandon Mitchell, who was pictured last August at an event in Washington held on the 57th anniversary of the civil rights movement's historic March on Washington.\nThe event included a Get Your Knee Off Our Necks protest at which speakers including Martin Luther King's son demanded racial equality. Mr Mitchell was pictured wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan \"Get your knee off our necks\" and \"BLM\", referring to the Black Lives Matter movement.\nJurors in the Chauvin case were asked before the trial whether they or people they knew well had \"participated in protests about police use of force or police brutality\".\nMr Mitchell - the only juror in the trial to give media interviews - says he answered no to that question.\nHe told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he had attended the event to commemorate the civil rights movement and had not seen it as an anti-police brutality protest.\n\"The opportunity to be around thousands and thousands of black people, I just thought it was a good opportunity to be a part of something,\" he said.\nBefore the trial, during questioning by Chauvin's defence team, Mr Mitchell said that he saw Black Lives Matter as a statement that he supported.\nThe 12-member jury took less than a day to declare Chauvin guilty following a highly charged, three-week trial in which 45 witnesses took the stand and several hours of video footage were shown.\nSeveral witnesses broke down in tears as they watched graphic footage of Mr Floyd's death and described feeling \"helpless\" as events unfolded.\nExpert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Mr Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to the manner of restraint employed by Chauvin and his colleagues.\nChauvin himself chose not to testify, invoking his right to not incriminate himself with his responses.\nThe 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in May 2020. A shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit note and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back.\nWhen police arrived, they ordered Mr Floyd out of his parked car and handcuffed him. A struggle ensued when officers tried to put a screaming Mr Floyd in their squad car. They wrestled him to the ground and pinned him under their weight.\nChauvin pressed his knee into the back of Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.\nAs he was being restrained, Mr Floyd said more than 20 times that he could not breathe, pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\nWhen the ambulance arrived, Mr Floyd was motionless. He was pronounced dead about an hour later."

      "text": "Ikea has launched its long-awaited furniture buy-back and re-sale scheme, in an attempt to reduce the number of products going to landfill.\nThe move is part of the retail giant's sustainability drive to become \"climate positive\" by 2030.\nCustomers will get vouchers to spend in-store if items they no longer need are returned in good condition.\nIkea admitted the scheme was a learning curve, but decided to launch it after successful trials in several cities.\n\"I'm not saying we have all the answers, but we learned enough from the pilots to tell us that this could be something of real value to us and our customers,\" Hege Saebjornsen, an environmental and sustainability expert at Ikea, told the BBC.\nThe initiative, originally scheduled to launch in November but postponed because of the pandemic, is now available in Ikea stores across the UK. It is also being launched in the other 26 countries in which Ikea operates.\nUsed products returned in as-new condition with no scratches will be bought for 50% of the original price, while items with minor scratches will be bought for 40%. Furniture that is well used with several scratches will be bought for 30%. \nThe items will be sold in separate areas of the stores, although Ikea has also announced a new partnership with Gumtree to sell second-hand products via the online marketplace.\nProducts eligible for buy-back include dressers, cabinets, bookcases and shelf units, small tables, dining tables and desks.\nThe Swedish company has already announced it wants to become fully \"circular\" - eliminate waste through the continual use of materials - by 2030. Ingka Group, Ikea's parent company, recently announced it was investing \u20ac4bn in renewable energy.\nCustomers wanting to sell back furniture go to Ikea.co.uk to fill out an online form, which generates a preliminary offer, and then take items to a store.\nMs Saebjornsen, a former sustainability manager at the retailer and now an Ikea adviser on the forthcoming COP26 climate summit, said that exactly what the consumer uptake will be is unknown.\nBut she said the trials, including in Sydney, Lisbon, Edinburgh and Glasgow, \"were really successful. It taught us a lot about the appetite for this and how people behave\". \nThe second-hand market generally - from clothing to homeware - is growing rapidly as shopping habits change, and Ikea hopes to tap into this, she said.\nOne potential drawback was that furniture must be delivered fully-assembled, a possible impediment for people who have heavy and bulky items.\n\"We still found people are taking us up on it [the scheme],\" she said. \nIkea is working on how to improve the disassembly of products. \n\"Some are better than others. Products can get damaged when taken apart, so we can only really accept assembled products. It maintains the security and quality of the item,\" she said.\nAlthough Ikea is offering vouchers, not cash, the scheme is not being introduced as a profit driver for the retailer, she said. Still, doesn't it reinforce a buy-new, disposable culture?\n\"We've taken all of that into account,\" Ms Saebjornsen said. \n\"It's really important to highlight that the voucher has no use-by date. They can be used to buy another second hand item, or food.\n\"The real consideration here is that it's about how we make sustainable and healthy living easy, accessible and affordable, and really mainstream.\n\"Ikea is such a large company with massive potential to reach millions of customers.\n\"We are not saying that we have all the answers. But small actions can make a difference.\"\nThe buy-back service is available in full-sized Ikea stores nationwide, excluding order and collection points in Tottenham Court Road, Norwich and Aberdeen. The service will launch in Reading and Belfast on 17 May."

A large-print version should also be available.\nPolling stations are selected for accessibility. But if a voter cannot enter, the presiding officer may take the ballot paper to them.\nFor help, call the Electoral Commission on 0333 103 1928.\nPeople occasionally sign their ballots - but if the name is identifiable, the vote will not count.\nNo - it is entirely up to you whether or not you vote. \nLocal councils recruit the presiding officer and staff to conduct the ballot, count the votes and process the postal votes.\nThe first councils will be counted overnight into early Friday morning.\nBut making the process Covid-secure means the results will probably take much longer than usual - possibly as late as Monday in some areas."

The 33-year-old's body was found in woodland a week after she vanished and a man is charged with her murder.\nBen hopes his and other initiatives being undertaken by the Cardiff University team will help their friends feel safe in university.\nThey also hope it helps challenge perceptions about the sometimes \"laddish\" culture associated with men's sports teams. \n\"People associate it with everyone out drinking, chasing girls, getting into fights and causing mischief, and that the lads aren't good members of society,\" he said.\n\"This laddish culture needs to change and not just in football, if what me and the boys are doing means people will start to look at sports societies differently and men act more responsibly then that's great.\"\nThe 22-year-old is president and club captain of the university football club and said that ultimately he just wanted to help after seeing the post - which turned out to be a hoax.\n\"We are not saying women need help but if someone was scared, I just wanted them to know that I would send one of the boys to walk you and make sure you are ok,\" he said.\n\"It's just horrible to think there are people out there that think it is ok - even as a hoax to scare women, and I think a lot of men get categorised into that men aren't safe, which isn't very fair.\n\"I just wanted to show that there are men out there that will help and aren't doing bad things.\"\nBen makes sure they all wear their red football tops and posted their faces on social media so they were easily identifiable to women who wanted a chaperone.\n\"My biggest worry was falling asleep and missing a text from someone, that would have been the worst thing in the world - to wake up and having a text from someone, not knowing if they got home safe of not,\" he said. \nBen's friend, Mia, said having members of the team available to walk her home made the \"world of difference\" and made her feel much more comfortable.\n\"It shouldn't be a thing where you have to have lads chaperone you but you don't really have a choice,\" she added.  \nRyan Smith, who was one of the chaperones, said he was \"buzzing\" to have been able to help.\n\"I just remember this one girl who kept apologising for wasting our time,\" said Ryan.\n\"But when you put it down to basics, it's a 15 minute walk home and she felt so scared and then was so embarrassed about that and it is crazy to think that someone has to do that.\nIt's an initiative which Cardiff University has welcomed, adding it was \"proud\" of the way the student community responded to the hoax.\nFor the football team, chaperoning was not the first time they have focused on student wellbeing.\nBen and the team's vice president, Jared Evitts, have also been working to encourage men to talk about mental health throughout the Covid pandemic. \n\"We wanted to provide something positive in a time where things were pretty bleak, it was a pretty dark time for all of us,\" Ben said.\nThe pair started a podcast during lockdown talking about mental health in sport. \n\"The lads opened up and we just wanted to keep that conversation going,\" Jared, a third year student, added. \n\"It was the first time the boys were speaking to each other openly, we just thought we would be silly to leave this.\n\"All the boys got involved and then when the athletics union got in touch to ask us to talk about mental health in sport, and with us unable to play and we weren't able to see each other, we thought what's a way that we can kind of help.\n\"We hope that it isn't going to just make a difference to the boys now but also those joining in the future.\n\"But we have to realise that this needs to be happening for all sports though not just football and the laddish culture needs to change.\n\"Covid has meant we have more time, but seeing the whole committee open up and share their experiences shows how much this is needed.\n\"Societies can have an impact and alleviate the pressures on services and that's what we are showing, that we can support each other.\"\nBen and Jared say they hope they can help change the perception people have of university football societies and the culture.\n\"It's overwhelming really, knowing that this could potentially be the start of better things and people focusing on mental health,\" Ben added.\n\"I mean I have always had my own mental health problems within the sport, but have never opened up and just to be in this position and potentially be a role model is incredible.\""

      "text": "The French government has warned it could cut electricity to Jersey amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights.\nMaritime Minister Annick Girardin told the French parliament that new rules governing access to Channel Islands waters were unacceptable.\nShe said France was \"ready to use... retaliatory measures\" under the UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal. \n\"I am sorry it has come to this [but] we will do so if we have to,\" she said.\nJersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, receives 95% of its electricity through three underwater cables from France.\nIn a statement to AFP news agency, the French fisheries ministry said the UK had introduced \"new technical measures\" linked to licences for fishing off the Channel Islands which had not been communicated to the EU and were therefore \"null and void\".\nMeanwhile, the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \"We are clear that Jersey is responsible for its own territorial waters.\"\nThe latest comments mark an escalation in the row over fishing rights, which has been simmering for months and marked a key sticking point in post-Brexit trade talks.\nFrench fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. To receive a licence under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators have to show a history of fishing in the area.\nJersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats are required to have a licence to operate there.\nOn Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located.\nBut the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that \"were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about\".\nThe French fisheries ministry said the new rules dictated \"where the ships can go and cannot go\" as well as the number of days fishermen can spend in the area.\n\"This is absolutely unacceptable,\" Ms Girardin said. \"If we accept this for Jersey, it would imperil our access everywhere.\"\nLast week, French Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune accused the UK more broadly of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with \"reprisals\" in financial services.\nMeanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish such as mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops.\nThe UK has also failed to strike a new fishing agreement with Norway. That failure threatens to prevent British trawlers catching cod in Norway's sub-Arctic seas."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nAn extra \u00a329.3m has been promised by the UK government to pump into fast-tracking vaccines that fight new Covid variants. While existing vaccines still protect against variants such as those found in Kent and South Africa, experts say it is vital to stay a step ahead of the mutating virus. The funding, on top of the \u00a319.7m already promised, will boost testing facilities at the Porton Down research laboratory, cover vaccine manufacture and, according to the government, means scientists can accelerate the pace and scale of their work.\nThe rights of care home residents to have visits from loved ones must be \"underpinned\" by law, according to a new report by cross-party MPs. The Joint Committee on Human Rights said it was \"unacceptable\" that some care home providers had argued it was not safe to follow government guidance. Since April, care home residents in England have been allowed two regular visitors indoors as lockdown has eased. But the report said providers have not felt bound by the guidance.\nOn Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country. As he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk. Experts say the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems and they tell the BBC that delays in decision-making worsened the crisis of India's second wave.\nIt's pretty normal for lab scientists to work long, unsociable hours to run experiments. But some young cancer researchers, including Dr Alba Rodriguez-Meira, have told Radio 1 Newsbeat that they're working longer, harder days, with no extra pay, because of coronavirus. Read their stories here.\nPresident Joe Biden has laid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 July - and roll out jabs for 12 to 15-year-olds as soon as possible. His new goal includes having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by Independence Day, adding his administration was working to win over \"doubters\" about the shots.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith more than 34.6 million people in the UK having had a first dose of a Covid vaccine and nearly 30% of all adults having been given the second, you might be wondering when you'll be invited to book an appointment for yours.

      "text": "Parents should put swimming lessons \"front and centre of their priorities\" as the country comes out of lockdown, Olympian Duncan Goodhew has said.\nIt comes after the sport's governing body said the lack of lessons during the Covid pandemic meant 240,000 children had missed out on learning how to swim 25m - the length of most pools.\nSwim England said more than five million swimming sessions were lost during the pandemic.\nPools first had to close in March 2020.\nIndoor pools are able to open across the UK and swimming classes have resumed in England, Scotland and Wales but are still limited in Northern Ireland to one-to-one lessons.\nMr Goodhew, who is president of charity Swimathon Foundation which has a Covid relief fund to support aquatics organisations, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"impossible\" for children to learn to swim without being in the water.\n\"It is particularly important with the holidays, with young kids running round at pools or the seaside who can't swim it is a pretty frightening experience for the parent,\" he said. \"So I think it is really important the parents put this front and centre of their priorities and get children signed up to learn to swim.\"\nMr Goodhew, who won gold at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, said 90% of pools had reopened but even before the pandemic there had been three-year waiting lists for lessons at some pools.\nHe said water safety, \"learning about when it is safe to swim and how to look after yourself etc and a better respect for the water\" was important for children.\nSwim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said people had \"returned to the water in droves\" since pools reopened but warned the organisation expected \"some regression amongst children's swimming ability\" with facilities having been closed.\nShe encouraged parents and guardians to be \"proactive\" in making up for lost time.\nOne parent who cannot wait to get his child in the pool is Olympic medallist Leon Taylor. \nHe said he was keen to start teaching his 10-month-old son Ziggy about water and swimming but as he was born in June last year he had \"never even been to swimming pool\" and his only water-based experiences were in the bath.\nMother-of-two Amy McCarthy, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, said she had seen deterioration in her son and daughter's swimming ability but was \"confident that we'll be able to make up for lost time\".\nBut some parents have struggled to get their children into lessons.\nEmma Buysman, from Buckinghamshire, said her youngest child was missing out after his lessons with a parent were cancelled during the first lockdown.\n\"It's now impossible to find a lesson for him as having turned three, he cannot yet swim without parental support while those classes he was in haven't yet moved up to the next stage as they have missed a year of classes,\" she said.\nShe added that her local leisure centre was trying to recruit new swimming teachers but was finding it difficult to allocate both pool slots and find teachers for the level of demand.\n\"People want public swimming and you can't have public swimming when you are having the lessons,\" she said.\nSam Gillett, from Bath, said swimming had become \"a luxury that many families cannot afford\" and said the leisure centre his family used had put up swimming costs due to the pandemic.\n\"It would now cost us \u00a322 for a family of four, with a two-year-old and five-year-old,\" he said.\n\"We are a relatively well-off family and that is too much for us to afford with any regularity, what about families with much less.\""

      "text": "Campaigning has finished for the Senedd election candidates, with voters heading to the polls on Thursday.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has had a real impact on candidates' campaigns, with restrictions affecting the likes of leafleting on the doorsteps and barring those standing from addressing mass public events.\nHere, BBC Welsh Affairs Editor Vaughan Roderick outlines five unknowns that will remain until the results are declared.\nWho will actually vote as we come out of the pandemic?\nVoter turnout is always lower for Wales-only elections compared to when Welsh voters take part in UK polls. \nWill some people have been nervous of going to the polling stations knowing that the virus is still around? \nIs it even possible that the vote could be skewed by older people because they have been vaccinated and feel safer going to the polls than people who haven't? \nAnd this time in Wales, 16 and 17-year-olds have the right to vote, with 70,000 of them entitled to vote. \nTwo questions here - first, how many of them will vote and second, what impact could they have - one expert, Roger Awan-Scully, says \"not much\". \nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nWhat about the fate of Welsh Labour's two red walls?\nThe so-called \"red wall\" areas are the blocks of the traditional Labour stronghold seats in north-east and south-east Wales.  \nIf Labour can keep hold of the \"red wall\" seats they lost to the Conservatives in the north-east at the 2019 UK election and hold the 21 seats they have in the south-east of Wales, then they will emerge as the largest party. \nThe unknown here is can any of the opposition parties chip away at the foundations of Labour's hegemony in the Senedd. \nIn Senedd elections, there are 60 seats up for grabs and each voter gets two votes - one for a constituency candidate and the other for a regional list candidate. \nIf the opposition parties don't make headway in the 40 constituency seats, then there are insufficient regional list seats to ensure a proportional result. \nThat means that the 20 regional seats are likely to be decided by very fine margins with a few hundred votes making the difference between success and failure.  \nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people voted to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nCan the Welsh Liberal Democrats cling on?\nAfter 160 years of history in which they dominated Welsh politics, they are now fighting for survival. \nCould they hold on to their single constituency seat of Brecon and Radnorshire or could they sneak a seat on a regional list? \nIf the party fails, it will be the first national election in Wales where the Liberal Party, the Liberal Democrats or its predecessor parties have failed to win a seat.  \nThe pandemic has transformed what have been perceived as weaknesses for Welsh Labour's Mark Drakeford into strengths. \nThe question is will the cautious academic approach he's taken as first minister appeal to the electorate in the time of crisis? \nHas Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price been restricted by the pandemic because he hasn't had the opportunity to address large public meetings at which he's thought to shine?\nThe Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies only took back the leadership from Paul Davies just a matter of weeks before the election, so has he had time to create an impact? \nCould that though prove a strength for the Conservatives - \"RT\", as he's known, he has a much bigger public profile than Paul Davies but could the late change undermine the party's core message?

Mr Jaishankar has not tested positive.\nIndia is currently on the UK's red list meaning travel from there is banned, but some jobs are exempt including representatives of a foreign country.\nThere are also exemptions to the self-isolation rule \"if it is confirmed that you are travelling to the UK for official business that cannot be undertaken while self-isolating\", according to the government's rules.\nThe G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.\nThe official summit of G7 leaders is taking place in Cornwall next month, but ministers are currently in the UK for talks.\nThe talks this week were the first face-to-face meetings the G7 powers have had in more than two years.\nIndia, Australia, South Korea and South Africa attended as guests.\nOn Tuesday, Home Secretary Ms Patel met Mr Jaishankar and tweeted a picture of them wearing masks as they handled folders, saying it was \"a pleasure\" to welcome him as new trade and investment deals were signed.\nIt is understood that because strict social distancing was maintained, Public Health England decided those in the meetings did not need to self-isolate. \nA senior UK diplomat said they \"deeply\" regretted that Mr Jaishankar could not attend in person.\n\"[He] will now attend virtually, but this is exactly why we have put in place strict Covid protocols and daily testing,\" the diplomat added.\nThe meeting on Wednesday was between foreign ministers, who were greeted by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with elbow and fist bumps in the courtyard of Lancaster House in London.\nThey then went to the summit room where the ministers were separated from one another by clear screens in order to minimise any risk from coronavirus. \nThey discussed new ways to ensure fairer access to vaccine stockpiles and increase support for the global vaccine distribution scheme known as Covax. \nAlso on the agenda on Wednesday was media freedom, arbitrary detention and girls' education.\nOn the news that positive cases had been found among the India delegation, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there were questions that needed to be raised \"about how this happened\".\n\"It is a reminder of how vigilant we need to be about our borders,\" he said, adding: \"Let's get to the bottom of how this happened - we cannot have a repeat.\"\nAsked whether holding the G7 meeting in person was a mistake because of the risk of Covid variants, Boris Johnson said it was \"very important to try to continue as much business as you can as a government\".\n\"As I understand it, what has happened is the individuals concerned are all isolating now,\" the prime minister said.\n\"I will be seeing the Indian foreign minister later this afternoon but that will be a Zoom exchange.\"\nAt the end of their meeting, the ministers issued a lengthy communiqu\u00e9. \nIt contained the group's strongest condemnation yet of China's treatment of the Uighur population in Xinjiang province and what it described as China's \"coercive economic policies\".\nAnd it added: \"We affirm the need to take collective action on the most pressing foreign and security challenges. The Covid-19 pandemic has underscored that global challenges require global collaboration.\""

It had been threatened with legal action by the charity John's Campaign over the isolation requirement.\nThe move, announced on Saturday, has now come into effect. \nOn Tuesday, the government's coronavirus dashboard recorded 1,946 new infections, as well as four deaths within 28 days of a positive test across the UK.\nThe recorded number of deaths is often lower immediately after weekends and bank holidays due to reporting lags.\nMore than 50 million Covid vaccinations have been given in the UK so far, with 34,667,904 first doses and 15,630,007 second doses.\nJenny Morrison, co-founder of Rights for Residents - a group founded to end \"inhumane restrictions\" preventing relatives visiting loved ones in care homes - told BBC Breakfast the change would certainly make a difference for her family, saying: \"Mum's care home is near the seafront. On a nice sunny day, after 14 months where she hasn't been outside, it will be amazing for us to wheel mum down to the seafront and have a picnic. It will just be absolutely wonderful.\"\nBut she said some care homes were ignoring the guidance, with some families being given good access for visits, either indoors or outside, but others not. She said family members needed to be seen not as \"just visitors\" but as \"essential components of people's care\". \nA petition has been delivered to the government, calling for the guidance on visits to be made legally binding. It also calls for relatives of care home residents to be given essential caregiver status by law, so they could continue to visit loved ones in case of another lockdown. \nDavid Finch, from Trowbridge, is hoping the care home where his wife Tricia, 74, lives will be implementing the changes. She has Alzheimer's and has been living at the care home since July 2020, yet her husband has never been inside. \n\"Trish hasn't seen her family properly since July,\" he said. \"The longer we go on with this separation, it's just deteriorating. I just need to be able to take her out, have a walk and feed the ducks. \n\"The trouble with the care home situation is because they're only guidelines, the care homes are frightened to death of implementing something that could cause them problems.\"\nWhat do the new rules for England mean? \nThe daughter of another care-home resident spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the change in guidance.\nWendy, from Essex, said: \"It's just been so tough. I feel like we've been forgotten and the families just feel so powerless. The visits have been so restrictive. \n\"It's been so difficult trying to have a simple conversation with my father through a screen.\"\nShe said the visits in care-home pods or gardens were only 20 minutes long, with both people wearing masks. \n\"They can't hear you, you can't hear them, you're watched as well - there's no privacy,\" she said. Wendy added that, as the only visitor allowed, \"You have this terrible responsibility to try to keep memories of everyone else alive.\" \nMargaret, from Colchester, also in Essex, says her mother, who lives in a care home, no longer recognises her.\nShe says her mother's age and frailty mean that meeting outside is not an option. She questions why she cannot have a \"meaningful visit\" sitting next to her mother inside the care home.\n\"I want to go and sit next to my mother and look her straight in the eye and say 'hello, I'm Margaret.'\"\nA blowy, rainy day in many areas means even though family and friends can now take care home residents for a walk in the park or to visit their garden, few are likely to venture out. \nAnd as the guidance was only published on Saturday, homes have had little chance to put in place risk assessments and any staff support required. \nStill, it is an important step forward for families who have become increasingly angry about the restrictions faced by residents of all ages as the rest of society opens up. Even when guidance is updated, some homes have chosen not to loosen restrictions. \nIt is one of the reasons campaigners are presenting a petition to the prime minister today calling for one named relative or friend to be legally recognised as part of each resident's essential care team, so allowing them access to care homes whatever is happening. \nJanet Shepherd from Utterby, Lincolnshire, says the new guidance means her partner could visit their garden, but added: \"He's got dementia and coming-home trips would have to be on a progressive scale because it makes them anxious. \n\"I would like to spend more time with him during the day, seeing what he does and getting involved. Going for walks and taking picnics round and maybe taking a car trip. Coming home after such a long time might be too much for him.\"\nSome have said there is not enough discretion for younger care home residents and there needs to be more easing of restrictions for them. Maggie Lyons, from Sheffield, said her 42-year-old son, who lives in a specialist care home for men with autism, is \"desperate to have some kind of life\". \n\"We, his parents, can't have him to our home for an overnight stay,\" she said. \"Young people in care homes are basically incarcerated.\n\"When my other children can visit me on 17 May he might not be able to. Yes, I can take him to a park or sit in the garden but that isn't what he wants to do.\"\nAnna Knight, chair of the Dorset Care Homes Association and manager of Harbour House Care Home in Bridport, said: \"You can imagine how it would make you feel if you were completely imprisoned, as it were, in your home.\" \nShe said it had not just been difficult for residents but for families and staff members as well, adding: \"Everybody has really struggled.\" \nMs Knight said her care home was now putting plans in place to allow visits outside the home to happen. \n\"It's going to be fantastic,\" she told Today. \"I know the families are already excited.\" \nShe said the previous guidance had been \"sensible\" but now was the time to start \"learning to live with this\". \nMike Padgham, who runs four care homes in North Yorkshire and is chair of the Independent Care Group, said the move represented limited progress.\n\"It's great news, but personally I think it could have come a bit sooner because people have not been able to have their freedom in care homes for well over a year,\" he said. He added there had not been enough notice given, saying: \"The public want to make arrangements and we're not quite geared up for it yet,\" he added. \nThe government is expected to review the self-isolation requirement for other visits when it reaches the next stage of the road map for easing coronavirus restrictions.\nAdditional reporting by Chris Bell\nAre you or a family member a care home resident?

      "text": "Welsh voters have gone to the polls to elect members of the Welsh Parliament, also known as Senedd Cymru.\nThe election will decide who forms the Welsh government, which runs many major services affecting people's day-to-day lives.\nThe Welsh government was set up in 1999, following a referendum.\nIt was created to give more power over key issues to the Welsh people.\nIt runs health, education, local government, transport, housing, economic development, social services, culture, Welsh language policy, agriculture and other public services.\nIt is in charge of much of the Covid-19 response in Wales, and also controls some taxes.\nWALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nMembers of the Senedd vote on laws, pass the Welsh government's plans to spend money on public services and keep an eye on what ministers are doing. \nThe Senedd is based in Cardiff and is separate from the House of Commons in London, which makes laws covering the whole of the UK.\nIt was known as the National Assembly for Wales until last May.\nThere are 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs), 40 of whom represent individual constituencies (areas). \nAnother 20 represent the five regions of Wales:\nEach region has four MSs. \nVoters get two ballots - one for a person to be their constituency MS, and the other for a party for their region.\nIt will be different, with plastic screens and hand sanitiser. \nPeople are being asked to take their own pen or pencil to fill in ballots. Those who might be vulnerable to coronavirus or are otherwise concerned can apply for a postal vote.\nProxy votes (where you nominate someone else to cast your vote) are available. Emergency proxy votes will be available on the day up until 17:00 BST if voters need to isolate.\nWHO SHOULD I VOTE FOR?\nWales election 2021: Compare what the parties are promising to do on the big issues with our election policy guide.\nThere are about 2.3 million voters in Wales.\nFrom this year, anyone over the age of 16 can vote, as well as an estimated 33,000 foreign nationals who did not previously have the vote.\nVoters must be living in Wales and registered to vote. They can be a British, Irish or Commonwealth national, an EU citizen or a foreign national permitted to be in the UK.\nThey can register to vote online, and must have done so by 19 April.\nCounting will start the next day - not overnight, because of the pandemic.\nIn constituencies, the candidate with the most votes wins. Regional seats are picked using a system which aims to elect MSs according to how many votes their party picked up in that region.\nOnce the results are in there is the question of who runs the next government.\nIf a party wins more than 30 seats, it will be able to form a government without help from the opposition.\nIf it does not win more than 30 seats, the largest party may try to govern anyway. But  it might need help from others - either through occasional deals or a more formal arrangement, known as a coalition.\nThe current first minister is Mark Drakeford - the leader of Welsh Labour since 2018.\nWith 29 seats, Labour was the largest party at the last election in 2016 but did not win enough to govern without some help from opposition politicians.\nThey have support from Lib Dem MS Kirsty Williams and former Plaid Cymru Senedd politician Lord Elis-Thomas, who both serve as ministers.\nThe rival candidates for first minister are Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.\nSmaller parties are also looking for votes - including the Welsh Liberal Democrats, UKIP, the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, Reform, Propel and the Wales Green Party.\nAlthough some of the smaller parties are unlikely to form a government, some could be included in power-sharing if none of the larger parties wins outright. \nMany will see this year's election as a judgement on the Welsh government's response to Covid-19.\nMark Drakeford has been in charge of Wales' lockdown, taking decisions on what parts of the economy to keep open, or keep closed, and on who legally can and cannot meet.\nParties will also make pledges about how they would run the NHS and other large services like education.\nThe Welsh government's controversial decision not to build an M4 relief road may be raised on the campaign trail, as well as what parties would do over tax."

      "text": "A glimpse of human grief, at the loss of a child 78,000 years ago, has been revealed in the discovery of the oldest burial site in Africa.\nThe Middle Stone Age grave - of a three-year-old child - was found in a cave in Kenya. \nIn a paper in the journal Nature, the researchers who studied the fragile, ancient remains described how its head appeared to have been laid on a pillow. \nScientists have named the child Mtoto, meaning \"the kid\" in Swahili. \nThe international team of archaeologists carefully cast the entire grave in plaster in order to preserve the arrangement of surviving bone fragments. This enabled them to transport the body safely to a laboratory for detailed study. \n\"It was like excavating a shadow,\" said Prof Mar\u00eda Martin\u00f3n-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution. \n\"[When we moved the cast], we didn't know we were carrying a child in our arms,\" she told the BBC's Inside Science programme. \nThe researchers were able to study the teeth to confirm that this was the tiny body of a human child - between two and three years old. Scans revealed that the body had been laid in a fetal position. \nAnd the bones had moved in a way that suggested it had been wrapped tightly when buried, with its head was originally resting on something like a cushion of leaves, which subsequently decomposed. \n\"We think the child was wrapped in a shroud made of leaves or animal skins - like he was placed in his last sleep,\" explained Prof Martin\u00f3n-Torres. \n\"There is such a delicacy and intention that really expresses feelings from the group towards this child.\"\nFurther examination of the size and shape of the bone fragments led the researchers to conclude that Mtoto was most likely a boy. \n\"He was buried in the cave -  where the people lived,\" Prof Martin\u00f3n-Torres said. \"All this behaviour meant something - maybe grief, maybe not letting him go.\" \nAfrica is considered the cradle of human modernity, but amid all the evidence of early tool use and community living, scientists say that burials were an important missing piece of the human evolutionary story there. \n\"The next oldest grave in Africa is about 74,000 years old,\" explained Dr Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum in London. \"Interestingly, that was also a young child, but it was poorly excavated about 50 years ago, so we don't know much about it.\"\n\"Here, there is definitely a sense of personal loss,\" she added. \"It's evidence of people who had a more symbolic representation of the world around them.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.\nProf Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said that data on falling Covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths was encouraging.\nHe told BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym that while another lockdown \"can't be completely ruled out\", he has become increasingly \"optimistic\" over recent months.\n\"In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,\" he said.\n\"Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country.\"\nProf Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored \"carefully\", but the UK has gone from a \"terrible situation\" in January to a \"remarkably good situation now\".\nLife would \"feel a lot more normal\" by early summer, he said, although questions remain over whether summer holidays abroad would be possible.\n\"We will have many fewer restrictions. Whether we have none at all it's too early to say,\" he added.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested there could be some \"opening up\" of foreign travel for people in England on 17 May - but said \"we have got to be very, very tough\".\nForeign holidays are currently banned, but a traffic light system of rules will be introduced with countries classed as green, amber or red.\nFurther details are expected this week, after the government said it will \"set out by early May\" how countries will be categorised.\nMr Johnson also said there was a \"good chance\" the 1m plus social distancing rule could be scrapped on 21 June in England, when the nation reaches the final step of its roadmap out of lockdown.\nHe said the results of the vaccine rollout were \"really starting to show up in the epidemiology\" - but any change would depend on the data.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Porton Down,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Extra funding to fast-track new vaccines will help \"future-proof\" the UK against new coronavirus variants, the vaccines minister has said. \nExisting vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps mutating. \nNadhim Zahawi said the \u00a329.3m funding increase would boost testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory.\nSeparately, he said booster jabs would be ready to deploy from September.\nAsked about reports in the Times that third jabs would be given to over-50s and those with underlying health conditions in the autumn, the vaccines minister said no decision had been made yet.\nMr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the booster programme could begin in September \"or later in the year, or early next year\".\nHe said clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme.\nClinical trials will also be looking at the evidence on mixing different vaccines to see what will offer the most protection.\nThe vaccines minister also confirmed there would be an update from the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later this week about England restarting international travel.\nMeanwhile, the government said its extra funding - on top of \u00a319.7m already promised - would also aid vaccine manufacture and allow scientists to accelerate the pace and scale of their work.\nThe cash will allow scientists to test 3,000 blood samples a week, up from 700 at the moment, to measure the levels of protective antibodies against Covid-19 generated by different vaccines.\nWhether or not at-risk adults are offered a booster dose this autumn will depend on two key factors: whether immunity from the first two doses has waned so older adults are vulnerable to an autumn wave of infection; and whether a variant emerges which means the current vaccines can't prevent serious Covid disease.\nUntil we know the answers, it would be wrong to assume a third booster dose is on the cards. But of course it is being planned for.\nAll vaccine manufacturers are working on tweaked vaccines, which will aim to deal with so-called escape variants.\nAnd a key UK trial - which will offer people a third dose of a different vaccine to the one they initially received - is not yet under way.\nIn January 2020, scientists across the world began work on vaccines against the novel coronavirus, long before the disease it caused even had a name. Had they waited until it was clear a vaccine was needed, the delay would have cost tens of millions of lives.\nThe government is already making plans for a booster Covid-vaccine programme in the autumn, to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter. \nLast week it ordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters.\nAnd it may use new, updated vaccines that are a better match for emerging variants. \nBut the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, said the global vaccine rollout should be prioritised over booster jabs in the UK.\nSpeaking to Radio 4's the World At One, he said: \"What you do with a scarce preventive action like a vaccine is that you give it to the people who need it the most. You have to look at the issue as a world issue. \n\"Top ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries that should come a bit later,\" he said.\nFollowing the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years.\"\nUK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: \"A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. \n\"This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants.\n\"While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops.\" \nThe government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered.\nProf Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said new variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic.\n\"In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country.\"\nProf Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored \"carefully\", but the UK had gone from a \"terrible situation\" in January to a \"remarkably good situation now\".\nCovid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval.

Let us emulate the king by being peaceful and continue to love all the queens,\" TimesLives quotes him as saying at his mother's memorial.\nHe also reflected on her qualities, adding \"she was my strength, she was an extraordinary mother. She taught us love, respect and the value of hard work, the importance of honouring tradition\".\nThe decision on who will now lead the Zulu nation of about 11 million people is yet to be made.\nThe throne does not have formal political power and the monarch's role within broader South African society is largely ceremonial. But the Zulu monarchy remains hugely influential, and has a yearly taxpayer-funded budget of more than $4.9m (\u00a33.5m).\nQueen Dlamini-Zulu was buried at KwaKhangelamankengane Royal Palace in a town about 480km (300 miles) from South Africa's main city Johannesburg in the early hours of Friday morning after a night vigil.\nThe queen was the sister King Mswati III of neighbouring Eswatini and she was buried according to Swati royal culture, reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko.\nHer body was wrapped in a cow's hide by a delegation that was sent by King Mswati and the funeral was attended by family members from both the Zulu and Eswatini monarchies. \nA state-funded memorial has followed at the palace, with the Zulu and Swati royal families in attendance, as well as former South Africa President Jacob Zuma, who has always celebrated his Zulu identity, and other politicians. \nNomsa Maseko, BBC News, KwaKhangelamankengane Royal Palace\nQueen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu was laid to rest in the thick of dawn at the royal palace. \nLater, hundreds of people gathered for the memorial, including ordinary members of the public and Zulu maidens whom the late queen was in charge of. \nThere was a nostalgic but sombre mood as mourners spoke fondly about her. \nPrince Misizulu is seen as the favourite to be the next king. Significantly, he was flanked by ibutho, a Zulu regiment, in a show of force. This suggests they support him to take over from his late father. \nZulu princesses in attendance were draped in leopard hides, mostly over their shoulders. Princes wore leopard-skin tabards as well as \"umqhele\" - a headband also made from leopard hide. \nThe royal delegation from Eswatini was also wearing their traditional attire.\nQueen Dlamini-Zulu was named regent by her late husband, King Zwelithini, who died from diabetes-related complications at the age of 72 on 12 March.\nThe longest-reigning Zulu monarch, King Zwelithini had six wives and at least 26 children. But he picked Queen Dlamini-Zulu as his successor because she was the only wife with royal blood.\nQueen Dlamini-Zulu had eight children - including five sons - with the late king and one of them, Prince Misizulu, is seen as the favourite to become the next king.\nA legal challenge has been launched by some members of the royal family who have questioned the authenticity of the king's will.\nOver the next few weeks the royal family is expected to meet and then name a new leader."

Of course that possibility is particularly frightening to local residents.\n\"I don't know, therefore, if it's someone who is regularly in the area,\"\nHe said Ms James' dog had been tested for any possible DNA evidence by forensic officers. \n\"We've got a very considerable forensic strategy and it does include the dog.\"\nPolice have issued a map of the area and are keen to speak to anyone who was there between 13:00 BST and 16:30. \nAfter releasing the new picture of Ms James, a Kent police spokesman said: \"The image shows Julia walking her Jack Russell Toby while wearing a light blue waterproof coat, blue jeans and dark coloured Wellington-style brown boots. \n\"It is the same clothing, apart from the gloves, which she wore on Tuesday 27 April.\"\nMr Richards said: \"We're hoping that this image of Julia wearing what she wore before her death will help jog people's memory.\n\"We want to hear from people who think they saw her walking Toby on that day and we also want to speak to people who were in the area that afternoon.\" \nOfficers are searching a number of locations in the area, Mr Richards said. \n\"We are trying to establish the route the offender approached the location where Julia was murdered and the route, if different, the offender left that location.\n\"This is a very remote location and people did not approach the scene in a conventional vehicle, most likely on foot. \n\"It's a popular dog walking area, but other vehicles - agricultural and off-road vehicles, bikes - would be capable of reaching that area, and we're considering every option.\"\nMr Richards said police were continuing \"to conduct as many house-to-house inquiries as possible\", adding: \"Residents in the Aylesham and Snowdown area can expect a visit from officers to allow them to discuss any concerns they may have as well as provide any information which could assist the investigation.\"  \nHe described the investigation as \"hugely challenging\" and said searches would continue for \"a number of weeks\". \nKent Police has encouraged those in the area to \"remain vigilant\" and if leaving home to \"tell someone where you are going and how long you will be\".\nOn Tuesday evening people left lit candles on their doorsteps and posted tributes online in memory of Ms James.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Exercise,Fitness,Peloton",
      "text": "Peloton has recalled treadmills in the US and UK over a series of safety issues following investigations by a US watchdog.\nIn the US, 125,000 Tread and Tread+ machines are being recalled after the death of a six-year-old child.\nThe watchdog said they could cause injury or death to adults, children and pets if they get pulled underneath.\nTread machines sold in the UK are also being recalled because display consoles could fall off.\nIn addition to the death, Peloton had 72 reports of injuries such as broken bones, cuts and grazes.\nPeloton boss John Foley said the firm had \"made a mistake\" in not recalling the machines sooner.\nIn March, Peloton warned parents to keep children away from its Tread+ machine after the death of the six-year-old, who was pulled underneath the rear of the treadmill.\nAt the time Mr Foley called it a \"tragic accident\" - one of a \"small handful\" of incidents in which children have been hurt on the firm's exercise equipment.\n\"I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission's request that we recall the Tread+,\" Mr Foley said in a statement on Wednesday.               \n\"We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologise.\"\nThe US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said that Peloton had voluntarily recalled the Tread+ and Peloton Tread, which posed a safety risk because the display console can fall off.\nAn agreement between the watchdog and Peloton means the firm must stop selling the machines in the US and give a full refund to people who want to return them.\nBecause of the type motor used in the Tread+, the machine needs a higher ground clearance than typical treadmills. \nRobert Adler, Acting Chairman of the CPSC, said: \"The agreement between CPSC and Peloton is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers. \n\"I would like to thank the CPSC technical staff who have worked tirelessly to protect consumers and to warn the public. Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products.\"\nThe company has yet to respond to a BBC request for clarity over how the recall might affect sales outside the US.\nHowever, the PA news agency said a Peloton spokesman confirmed that the recall also related to the Tread in the UK. \nIn the US, the Tread was only sold as part of a limited invitation-only release from about November, 2020 to about March, 2021 and the company's statement said it \"is currently working on a repair to be offered to Tread owners in the coming weeks\".\nBut the statement does not mention Tread repairs outside the US.\nThe touchscreen on the Tread can detach and fall, according to the CPSC. There have been reports of minor injuries such as abrasions, cuts and bruises in the UK and Canada.\nHowever, the Tread+ carries a more serious hazard because \"adult users, children, pets and objects can be pulled underneath the rear of the treadmill, posing a risk of injury or death\".\nPeloton rose to prominence during the pandemic as a premium option for allowing people to exercise from home with live video from trainers, as gyms were forced to close. Shares in the New York-based company tumbled more than 14% after the recall announcement.\nIn addition to the death, there have been about 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second and third-degree abrasions, broken bones and lacerations.

      "title": "US birth rate falls 4% to its lowest point ever",
      "tags": "Women,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Pregnancy",
      "text": "The American birth rate fell for the sixth consecutive year in 2020, with the lowest number of babies born since 1979, according to a new report.\nSome 3.6 million babies were born in the US in 2020 - marking a 4% decline from the year before, found the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics.\nThe slump was seen across all recorded ethnicities and origins, according to the findings. \nThe national picture mirrors a decline in births seen worldwide, a trend some experts say has been accelerated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. \nIn the CDC report, demographers examined the country's general fertility rate, which compares the number of live births with the number of women considered to be of childbearing age - between 15 and 44 years old. \nIn 2020, the general fertility rate in the US was about 56 births per 1,000 women - the lowest rate on record and about half of what it was in the early 1960s. \nThe decline in birth rates was seen across all measured racial and ethnic groups. Births dropped by 4% among white, black and Latina women, 9% for Asian women, 3% for Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders and 7% for Native American and Alaska native women. \nThe report also analysed the total US fertility rate, which estimates how many babies a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetime based on actual birth rates. For a generation to exactly replace itself, this number must be at or above 2.1.\nAccording to the CDC, this rate has generally been \"below replacement\" since 1971 and has consistently been below replacement since 2007. Today, the US total fertility rate sits at 1.6 - another record low. \nExperts say the country's tumbling birth rate is closely linked to the average age of American mothers. Women are becoming mothers later in life - a phenomenon tied to increases in educational attainment, growing labour force participation and delays in marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. The average age of mothers at first birth is 27, up from 23 in 2010, recent CDC data has found. \nThis changing picture of motherhood has been driven in part by declines in pregnancy among teenagers. The birth rates among teenagers aged 15-19 had the steepest decline of all age groups: down by 8% in 2020 to around 15 births per 1,000 females.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics has said it is too early to determine whether the pandemic had a significant effect on birth rates because this year's data is in keeping with past trends. But initial research suggests that Covid-19 may have compounded existing patterns. \nIn a June 2020 study by the Guttmacher Institute, one in three US women said that because of Covid-19, they were likely to delay having children or have fewer children altogether. And researchers from the Brookings Institution - who predicted a \"large, lasting baby bust\" due to Covid-19 - have suggested that the anxiety and economic uncertainty wrought by the pandemic will further depress birth rates going forward. \nData from the CDC shows births falling most sharply toward the end of last year when babies conceived at the start of the pandemic would have been born. \nThe slowing US birth rate is echoed by worldwide trends.\nWhile wealthy countries like Germany and Japan have seen slowing birth rates for some time, the same is now happening in middle-income countries as well, including Thailand and Brazil. Globally, the fertility rate is expected to fall below replacement levels - 2.1 births per woman - by 2070, according to a 2019 report from the UN. \nBy the end of this century, the report found, the world's population is projected to virtually stop growing for the first time in history. And a widely cited study published in the Lancet last year suggested this population peak would come even earlier - in 2064. \nBetween 2020 and 2100, 90 countries are expected to lose population, including two-thirds of all countries and territories in Europe. According to the UN numbers, Africa is the only region in the world projected to have strong population growth for the rest of the 21st Century - mostly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. \nSimilar to trends in the US, the UN has linked falling fertility rates and population growth to gradual delays in childbearing among women. Though the mean age of childbearing varies widely throughout the world, overall increases will continue to lower fertility rates and global population growth in turn. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Porton Down,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Extra funding to fast-track new vaccines will help \"future-proof\" the UK against new coronavirus variants, the vaccines minister has said. \nExisting vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps mutating. \nNadhim Zahawi said the \u00a329.3m funding increase would boost testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory.\nSeparately, he said booster jabs would be ready to deploy from September.\nAsked about reports in the Times that third jabs would be given to over-50s and those with underlying health conditions in the autumn, the vaccines minister said no decision had been made yet.\nMr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the booster programme could begin in September \"or later in the year, or early next year\".\nHe said clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme.\nClinical trials will also be looking at the evidence on mixing different vaccines to see what will offer the most protection.\nThe vaccines minister also confirmed there would be an update from the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later this week about England restarting international travel.\nMeanwhile, the government said its extra funding - on top of \u00a319.7m already promised - would also aid vaccine manufacture and allow scientists to accelerate the pace and scale of their work.\nThe cash will allow scientists to test 3,000 blood samples a week, up from 700 at the moment, to measure the levels of protective antibodies against Covid-19 generated by different vaccines.\nWhether or not at-risk adults are offered a booster dose this autumn will depend on two key factors: whether immunity from the first two doses has waned so older adults are vulnerable to an autumn wave of infection; and whether a variant emerges which means the current vaccines can't prevent serious Covid disease.\nUntil we know the answers, it would be wrong to assume a third booster dose is on the cards. But of course it is being planned for.\nAll vaccine manufacturers are working on tweaked vaccines, which will aim to deal with so-called escape variants.\nAnd a key UK trial - which will offer people a third dose of a different vaccine to the one they initially received - is not yet under way.\nIn January 2020, scientists across the world began work on vaccines against the novel coronavirus, long before the disease it caused even had a name. Had they waited until it was clear a vaccine was needed, the delay would have cost tens of millions of lives.\nThe government is already making plans for a booster Covid-vaccine programme in the autumn, to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter. \nLast week it ordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters.\nAnd it may use new, updated vaccines that are a better match for emerging variants. \nBut the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, said the global vaccine rollout should be prioritised over booster jabs in the UK.\nSpeaking to Radio 4's the World At One, he said: \"What you do with a scarce preventive action like a vaccine is that you give it to the people who need it the most. You have to look at the issue as a world issue. \n\"Top ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries that should come a bit later,\" he said.\nFollowing the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years.\"\nUK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: \"A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. \n\"This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants.\n\"While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops.\" \nThe government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered.\nProf Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said new variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic.\n\"In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country.\"\nProf Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored \"carefully\", but the UK had gone from a \"terrible situation\" in January to a \"remarkably good situation now\".\nCovid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported another 1,946 daily infections, as well as a further four deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe recorded number of deaths is often lower after weekends and bank holidays due to reporting lags.\nThe government's latest data showed more than 50 million Covid vaccinations have been given in the UK so far, with 34.7 million first doses and 15.6 million second doses administered."

'you need to pay 160 thousand'. So he cashed his pension in, sold his car, borrowed money and I helped him.\n\"I mean at this point I think it was about \u00a345k I'd sent him to help him with the tax bill.\"\nAccording to Action Fraud, romance or dating fraud is where criminals dupe people into sending them money by gaining their trust and convincing them they are in a genuine relationship.\nIn order to stay safe from such scams, it advises people to:\nAnyone who believes they have been a victim of romance fraud, it said, should report it to their bank immediately and to Action Fraud.\nContinuing the story, Ms Elwell said the man had claimed two \"heavies\" had turned up and he had been locked in a cellar. He sent her pictures purporting to show him there. \nShe added he claimed to have been released after money had been sent, but he had told her he would not have his passport, which had been taken from him, until interest had been paid.\nOn the day the man told Ms Elwell he was due to fly back, 16 March, she went to Heathrow airport and got an email from supposed airport officials saying he had been arrested. \nShe said she had then approached Border Force officials who said, \"look, it's a scam\".\nShe went to his supposed house in Coventry to meet his daughter and housekeeper/nanny, but \"no such people lived at that house\".\nMs Elwell said: \"It was in that moment that I knew it was all a lie.\"\nA spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: \"Rachel's case is a prime example of romance fraud, her case highlights how much these scammers affect people's lives.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Environmental campaigners suspect a Liechtenstein prince shot dead probably the biggest bear alive in the EU on a hunting expedition in Romania in March.\nThey say Prince Emanuel von und zu Liechtenstein had been granted a permit to shoot a female bear that had caused damage to some farms.\nBut it was not a female that was shot but Arthur, a 17-year-old brown bear.\nThe prince who lives in Austria has not yet responded, and the BBC's attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful.\n\"We don't have a personal problem with the prince,\" Gabriel Paun of Environmental group Agent Green told the BBC. \"We believe the hunting association was meeting his needs.\" \nThe office of the Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein told AFP news agency it did not know the background of this \"private and personal matter\". But it did stress that nature \"has been one of the fundamental concerns of the House and is a central element of the family's commitment to ecological and social sustainability\". \nRomania's national environmental guard has launched an investigation into the bear's death.\nThere is no verification that a hunting permit was granted to the prince. However, Agent Green has produced a leaked document that appears to be a permit from authorities to a hunting association in Covasna granting the prince several days in March, and detailing the death of a bear in the village of Ojdula in Transylvania.\nTrophy hunting was barred in Romania in 2016 as the brown bear is protected by an EU directive. But hunting is allowed for \"problematic\" bears that cause damage. Campaigners say a local farmer had complained of an issue with three females and their cubs some time ago, but that the March kill had not solved the issue.\n\"To get a derogation [permit] you have to prove you've done all diligence. Derogation is the exception and not the rule,\" said Mr Paun. \"Once you extract large bears out of the population you start to destabilise the population so he had a crucial role.\" Without bears such as Arthur there is a risk of in-breeding, he fears.\nEnvironment Minister Tanczos Barna confirmed that a permit had been issued to get rid of a nuisance bear but did not give details of who received it.\nThe head of Romania's National Environmental Guard protection agency, Octavian Berceanu, said an inquiry had been opened last week into why a male bear had been shot and that poaching was one of the suspicions of the case.\nAs females are far smaller than Arthur, activists believe the older alpha male was deliberately targeted for his trophy value of 592.8 points out of a possible maximum 600.\nAnn-Kathrin Freude of Austrian environmental group VGT told the BBC that as far as they were aware the shooting of Arthur had produced the highest score ever recorded. \"It is a really great trophy to get one of these iconic animals - it's like a good wine.\""

      "text": "The rights of care home residents to have visits from loved ones must be \"underpinned\" by law, according to a new report by cross-party MPs.\nThe Joint Committee on Human Rights said it was \"unacceptable\" that some care home providers had argued it was not safe to follow government guidance.\nSince April, care home residents in England have been allowed two regular visitors indoors as lockdown has eased.\nBut the report said providers have not felt bound by the guidance.\nThe regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), said it had found that 95% of providers were enabling visiting to happen. \nThe parliamentary report said that while coronavirus restrictions had been eased in care homes over the past few months, anecdotal evidence heard as part of its inquiry suggested a \"large number\" were not following government guidance.\n\"Many care home providers are arguing that it is not yet safe to follow the guidance, denying care home residents these important family links as part of their right to family life. This is completely unacceptable.\"\nIt said it was \"astonishing\" the CQC had claimed during its evidence to the committee in April that it was not aware of any care home in England failing to follow the guidance on visits.\nLabour's Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the committee, said: \"By not underpinning this guidance in law, care homes have not felt bound by it and important rights have therefore not been respected.\n\"The Care Quality Commission assurances that visits are being allowed properly now in all homes is wholly unconvincing.\n\"Because care homes see guidance about allowing visits as advisory rather than binding, the government must now bring forward regulations to give their guidance on visits legal force.\"\nThe MPs and peers on the committee concluded that to prevent future blanket bans on visits, they wanted it to be a legal requirement that each resident has their individual circumstances assessed.\nWhen giving evidence to the committee, the CQC said it did not collect quantitative data on how many visits have occurred across care homes.\nThe committee urged the CQC to \"get a grip\" and ensure more robust processes were in place for monitoring adherence to the guidance by the end of May.\nKate Terroni, chief inspector of adult social care at the CQC, said the regulator had been clear throughout the pandemic that blanket approaches to visiting were unacceptable.\nShe said that during 941 inspections in the last eight weeks, the CQC had found that 95% of care homes were enabling visiting to happen, and action was taken against the other five per cent.\n\"Concerns have been raised with us about 30 potential blanket bans and we have taken action in every case,\" she said.\n\"We expect providers to follow government guidance on visiting where people are entitled to have designated visitors.\"\nSocial Care Minister Helen Whately said the care homes themselves should decide on visiting policies.\n\"We recognise that every care home has a unique layout, physical environment and facilities, and residents have their own individual health and wellbeing needs, which is why care homes themselves are best placed to decide how to enable visiting safely,\" she said.\nThe report comes a day after new guidance came into force in England allowing care home residents to go on low-risk trips without having to self-isolate for 14 days when they return.\nIn Scotland, care home residents are allowed to choose two people to visit indoors once a week, while in Wales, indoor care home visits are allowed for two visitors.\nFrom Friday in Northern Ireland, care home visits are being increased from one to two a week - each lasting for one hour."

Airport authorities had used antigen rapid test kits supplied by Kimia Farma.\nFollowing complaints from passengers that they had received false positive test results, police sent an undercover officer to pose as a passenger last week, reported local news outlet Detik.\nWhen he was swabbed and received a positive test result, other officers swooped in and raided the test site, where they found a used test kit that had been recycled.\nLast week, five Kimia Farma employees - including the company's Medan manager - were arrested. The suspects are accused of breaking health and consumer laws by washing nasal swab sticks and repackaging them for sale. \nLocal media said authorities have compiled reports from 23 witnesses, and are investigating whether the profit from the scam - estimated to be around 1.8bn rupiah (\u00a389,700; $124,800) - was used to fund the construction of a lavish house for one of the suspects. \nKimia Farma, which is headquartered in the capital Jakarta, has since fired the staff involved and promised to tighten internal controls.\nThis week, two lawyers who frequently flew via Kualanamu airport in recent months, said they were planning to sue Kimia Farma, the South China Morning Post reports. \nIn a collective lawsuit, they hope to get 1bn rupiah for each passenger who has been affected by the scheme. \nEarlier this week, Indonesian authorities said they had identified two cases of the new Covid variant first seen in India. \nLast month, Jakarta stopped issuing visas for foreigners who had been in India in the previous 14 days.\nThe Muslim-majority nation has also banned domestic travel at the end of Ramadan this month, a period which traditionally sees people travelling across the country to visit relatives, and introduced heightened restrictions for other dates.\nIndonesia has seen one of the worst Covid outbreaks in Asia, and overall has recorded about 1.7m positive cases and more than 46,000 deaths linked to the pandemic.

      "text": "The UK government has agreed to give the European Union ambassador in London full diplomatic status.\nThe Foreign Office had resisted the idea, arguing the EU should not be treated like an independent nation.\nBut in a joint statement, the UK and EU announced ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida, would get \"a status consistent with heads of missions of states\".\nHe will now be immune from detention, prosecution or taxation during his time in London.\nThese are among the privileges given to diplomats in the states where they are stationed, as sanctioned by the Vienna Convention.\nIn more than 100 other countries, the EU's ambassadors have the same status as those representing sovereign nations.\nUntil now, however, the UK government had said it wanted instead to treat the EU's London delegation in London as representatives of an international organisation.\nBut the EU complained that this was inappropriate and could damage relations, while critics accused ministers of wanting to punish Brussels in the aftermath of protracted Brexit negotiations.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab and EU Vice-President Josep Borrell met on Wednesday at the margins of the G7 meeting, taking place in London, to try to resolve the dispute.\nThey later issued a joint statement saying they had \"reached an agreement together, based on goodwill and pragmatism\".\nThey said EU delegation staff in London would \"have the privileges and immunities needed to function effectively, while allowing for effective administration of justice\", adding that they looked forward to \"moving ahead and tackling global challenges together\".\nMr Raab and Mr Borrell also discussed joint work on climate change, ahead of the Glasgow COP26 climate summit, set to take place this autumn.\nThe G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - with the EU representatives in attendance.\nThis week's talks were the first face-to-face meetings the G7 member states have had in more than two years because of the pandemic."
