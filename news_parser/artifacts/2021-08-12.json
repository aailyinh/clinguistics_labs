      "tags": "Companies,Clothing industry,Retailing,Boohoo,Sustainability,Fashion",
      "text": "The boss of fast fashion online retailer Boohoo has insisted its clothing brands are \"not throwaway\". \nIn an exclusive interview with BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money podcast, John Lyttle said Boohoo had a \"clear strategy\" for being more sustainable.\n\"We're here because people want to wear clothes, they have to be supplied,\" he told the BBC.\n\"We're trying make the journey as sustainable as possible,\" he added.\nHowever, sustainability targets the company has set itself could take some time to meet, he said, adding there were \"lots of pieces still to answer.\"\n\"20% of all our ranges will be sustainable this autumn... 40% next spring/summer,\" said Mr Lyttle.\n\"They're not going to be fixed in six and 12 months... It's the same 2030 timeframe as combustible engines.\"\nBoohoo owns 13 brands: Boohoo, BoohooMan, Coast, Karen Millen, Dorothy Perkins, Warehouse, Oasis, Wallis, Burton, Debenhams, PrettyLittleThing, NastyGal and MissPap.\nMr Lyttle, a former chief operating officer at Primark, defended Boohoo's ultra-low advertised prices for its clothing: \"We're not down in the cheap end. Even on our lower price brand our selling price is higher.\"\nHe added: \"Our data doesn't suggest people are buying every day or buying once and wearing something new.\"\nFormer Labour MP and Environmental Audit Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said Boohoo's environmental policy claims and 20% sustainability target amounted to \"greenwashing\".\n\"We've consistently seen them play cat and mouse with lawmakers and public opinion on the issue of sustainable working practices and sustainable consumption,\" she said.\n\"Boohoo in particular has to reduce the volume of clothes it makes and accurately price their garments to reflect the environmental cost of fashion production.\"\nMeanwhile Noelle Hatley, senior lecturer in fashion business at Manchester's Fashion Institute, said brands were able to use the term \"sustainable\" because there is \"no industry-wide agreement on its meaning\".\n\"40% is a reasonable target, but it all hinges on what they mean by sustainable and how much information they will actually share with the customers,\" she stressed.\nBoohoo was founded in 2006 in Manchester by Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane. By 2020, the company had hit sales of \u00a31.2bn and boasted a 5,000-strong workforce. \nThe aim of the venture was to use the internet to \"cut out the middle man\" in retail. \nAs well as facing questions about the environmental impact of Boohoo's fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of widespread abuse of employment law at some of its suppliers in Leicester.\nInvestigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage amid unsafe working conditions.\nSubsequently, an independent review into the retailer concluded that there were \"many failings\" in the way Boohoo managed its supply chain. \n\"We were very upset about it,\" Mr Lyttle said. \"It's not the culture of our business, it's not how we look after our staff.\n\"We want to make sure everything is proper and done in the right way.\"\nThe crisis led to calls for his resignation, but he says this would not have been the right approach to take.\n\"If I'd have resigned, it would have set it back - in terms of time - to do what we needed to do,\" he stressed.\nHe added that Boohoo had \"not seen evidence\" of workers being paid under the minimum wage, but the company could \"level up our audit and investigation to ensure those workers are getting paid\".\nBoohoo is now creating 3,000 new jobs across the country, including at a warehouse in Burnley, as well as more roles at its Manchester headquarters. \nMr Lyttle said consumer habits had changed during the Covid-19 pandemic, prompting the company to hire more staff.\n\"We need efficiency and speed,\" he added. \"Immediacy is the biggest trend in the last 18 months and that's getting greater and greater. Consumers drive the trends.\"\nInterview by Sean Farrington, additional reporting by Elisabeth Mahy."

      "tags": "Home Office,Jamaica,UK government,Immigration,Deportation",
      "text": "A Home Office deportation flight left for Jamaica overnight with just seven people on board, after last-minute legal challenges.\nThe flight, which is understood to have taken off from Stansted Airport in Essex just before 01:30 BST, was originally meant to deport 50 people.\nLawyers said it was \"an enormous waste of taxpayers' money\".\nThe Home Office said all those on board were convicted criminals with no legal right to remain in the UK.\nAnd it added that late legal claims can reduce the value for money of these operations.\nSome 18 of the legal challenges were made in the 24 hours before departure.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel is required by law to issue a deportation order for any foreign national who has been given a jail sentence of more than a year. \nPersistent offenders or those convicted of serious crimes may also be deported where it is deemed \"conducive to the public good\".\nCampaigners had been trying to stop the flight, with reports that some may have had a right to British citizenship.\nOn average, a deportation flight costs around \u00a3200,000, so returning the handful of passengers to the Caribbean is likely to have cost the Home Office about \u00a330,000 each.\nThis is not the first time the Home Office has sought and failed to organise a mass deportation to Jamaica. \nIn December, another aircraft intended to have 50 Jamaican nationals on board left with just 13.\nOn that occasion, the Home Office acknowledged some of those due to fly may have been victims of modern slavery.  \nThe home secretary is keen to demonstrate her commitment to securing Britain's borders.  \nBut with record numbers of migrants arriving in small boats on the Kent coast, and continued problems in organising deportation flights, there is obvious frustration in the department.\nMaria Thomas, of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said some deportees did not fly after claims they were entitled to stay in the UK as part of the Windrush Scheme, which grants residency to many West Indian migrants and their descendants.\nOthers, she said, had tested positive for Covid, while two of her clients - one in his 20s and another in his 30s who have lived in the UK since they were 10 and 11 - were taken to hospital in the afternoon after attempting to take their own lives in a government immigration removal centre.\nMs Thomas described the practice of removing by way of charter flights as \"brutal\". She said: \"It's extremely concerning. \n\"It's an enormous waste of taxpayers' money to charter a plane in these circumstances, particularly in light of an ongoing pandemic.\"\nBella Sankey, director of Detention Action which assists with some of the legal challenges, tweeted that the situation was \"complete chaos\" and the Home Office \"hasn't got a clue what it's doing\".\nThe Home Office said \"extensive checks\" had been carried out to ensure that no-one on board had been eligible for the Windrush Scheme.\nIt said the 43 people who did not fly had committed crimes including murder and rape, and that their combined sentences \"totalled 245 years\".\nDamion Thompson, a Jamaican man who has lived in Leeds for 20 years, was due to be deported on Wednesday.\nIt's been 10 years since he was sentenced to jail for drugs offences - serving 14 months - triggering his automatic removal from the UK.\nHis wife, Linda Rose, said the deportation order had been \"hanging over the family\" ever since, despite several attempts to overturn it.\nNow the family say they have secured a seven-day injunction to try to stop his deportation - but they \"don't want to get too hopeful\".\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We make no apology for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals.\"\nMs Patel said those who were meant to be on board \"have violated our laws and values and have left their victims living with the scars of the crimes that took place against them\".\n\"The British people should be in no doubt of my determination to remove these criminals to protect both the victims of their crimes and the public. The government uses every means to continue to remove foreign nationals who have committed crimes against our citizens,\" she said.\n\"We remove foreign criminals from the UK to different countries every week and this flight is no different.\""

      "tags": "Surgery,NHS England,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A record number of people - more than 5.45 million - are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England. \nThe June figures show a mixed picture - with the numbers waiting more than 18 weeks or a year both down, but a rise in those waiting more than two years.\nMany have joined the waiting list in recent weeks, as more people are referred for treatment. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would look at \"what more we need to do\" for the NHS.\nNHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said the summer had seen some of the highest numbers ever coming forward for care.\nAnd he said the health service had made \"effective use\" of the additional resources it had been given to address the Covid backlog.\nThe data published today also shows:\nBut in signs of progress, the number of patients waiting longer than 18 weeks for care has dropped by almost 25,000 to 1.7 million.\nThe number having to wait more than a year to start treatment was 304,803 in June - down from 336,733 the previous month.\nMost hospitals are doing all they can to reduce the number of long waits for operations.  \nSome trusts in England have been given extra funding if they can get their volume of work above pre pandemic levels - extending operating theatre hours with smarter use of the time available and cutting down delays with pre-op checks for patients are among the policies being adopted.  \nTrusts are working more closely with GPs, pharmacists and other local health providers to try to reduce the number of patients requiring hospital treatment, so freeing up resources for those who most need it.  \nBut dealing with new referrals and tackling the backlog are huge tasks.  And millions more who did not come forward for treatment during the pandemic may now do so. \nThe issue is rising rapidly up the political agenda. Growing waiting lists are also evident in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  \nSajid Javid, the Health Secretary, discussing the issue in England has said more money will be required.  The question is how much.  There could yet be battles with the chancellor in the run up to the spending review in the autumn.\nThe health secretary said waiting lists would rise as people came back to the NHS for healthcare having not done so during the worst periods of the pandemic.\nMr Javid said: \"We estimate there's probably some seven million people that ordinarily would have come forward to the NHS that stayed away, understandably, during the height of the pandemic.\n\"We want those people to come back. I don't know how many will come back but, even if half of them came to the NHS - and can I just stress I really want people that need to be seen by the NHS to know the NHS is there for them and they should come forward - but as they do I think waiting lists will rise because there will be a huge increase in demand.\"\nHe said an extra \u00a329bn had gone into the NHS and social care this year.\nChris Hopson of NHS Providers told the BBC the NHS was \"going at full pelt\" to try to get through the backlog.\nBut he added: \"They're having to cope with the fact that we're 8,000 beds short compared to the normal number of beds we have because of infection control, and we've got large numbers of staff self-isolating. \n\"We're also in the peak leave period and we've got very large numbers of people coming in for urgent and emergency care - and we've still got 5,000 Covid patients in hospital beds.\"\nHe said a long-term funding settlement was vital.\nProf Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said a \"volatile mix of pressures\", including Covid control measures and staff shortages due to pinging, was hindering the NHS's ability to address the surgery backlog. \nOf the 5,727 patients waiting more than two years for treatment - a 46% increase on the previous month - the RCS says most need hip and knee replacements, gallbladder removals or hernia operations.\nIt warns some may be unable to work, or carry out day-to-day tasks, while they wait for their procedures.\nSome have warned the number on waiting lists could rise much further, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warning it could rise to 14m by the end of 2022."

      "text": "On Saturday morning, Gyanraj Rai ate his breakfast, headed to Downing Street, and began a protest about his pension. He hasn't eaten since.\n\"Better to die than be a coward\" is a motto of the Nepalese Gurkha soldiers, who have been an integral part of the British Army for more than 200 years.\nAnd 63-year-old Mr Rai says he is prepared to die - to starve to death - if the government does not agree to make his pension equal to the British soldiers he fought alongside for 20 years.\nNext to him in wheelchairs near the Downing Street gates are ex-soldier Dhan Gurung, 59, and Gurkha widow Pushpa Rana Ghale, 59, who has travelled from Nepal. \nOn Wednesday they entered their fifth day on hunger strike. They don't even have a gazebo to shelter them from the elements. It was taken down by the Met Police, who said it was \"in breach of local bylaws.\"\n\"This is the last resort to go to hunger strike to the death,\" Mr Rai tells the BBC. \"We want to be treated equally with the British in every aspect. That's why we are here, prepared to die.\"\nMore than 200,000 Gurkhas fought in the two world wars, and in the past 50 years they have served in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nYet Gurkhas who retired before 1997 receive a fraction of the pension the rest of the British Army receive. \nThe Gurkha Pension Scheme (GPS) was based on Indian Army rates for those with at least 15 years' service. \nThe government says it was designed for retirement in Nepal, where the cost of living is significantly lower than in the UK.\nBut in 2009, all retired Gurkhas won the right to live in the UK, following a high-profile campaign led by actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served with the 6th Gurkha Rifles.\nMr Rai, who had travelled from Reading for the protest, says he followed his uncles to join the British Army aged 17.\n\"During service we were given a very small amount of salary compared to our British counterparts,\" he says.\n\"And after our service, the pension was very low. My pension was only \u00a347 a month, where a British veteran used to get over \u00a3800 a month.\"\nHe says his lump sum on leaving the army was \u00a33,000 compared to that of a British veteran who received between \u00a360,000 and \u00a370,000.\nHe says today he receives a monthly pension of \u00a3350 compared to British ex-soldiers of the same rank who receive \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,300.\nWhen the BBC put these figures to the Ministry of Defence it did not dispute them.\nIn 2007, pension rules were changed to give serving Gurkha soldiers equal pension rights with other service personnel in the UK.\nBut the British Gurkha Welfare Society said about 25,000 men who had retired before 1 July 1997 were denied the opportunity to transfer into UK armed forces pension schemes.\nThis is not the first time Mr Rai has gone on hunger strike. He did not eat for 14 nights and 15 days in 2013.\nHe only stopped when a group of MPs announced plans to hold an inquiry into Gurkha pensions and other issues. But Mr Rai says the inquiry did not go far enough.\nDhan Gurung, 59, from Basingstoke, says he followed his grandfather's tracks into the Gurkhas - and into poverty.\nHe served the maximum time permitted for Gurkha soldiers, which was 15 years unless they were granted yearly extensions.\nHe called it a \"big discrimination\" that he was forced to retire when the normal term of engagement for his British counterparts was 22 years.\n\"When I retired in 1994 my monthly pension was \u00a320 only,\" he says. \"How I survived...with my wife, my daughter and my son.\"\nHe says Gurkha families in Nepal were left in poverty so their children could not get an education. \n\"Now they working in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Israel all over the world in dirty, difficult and dangerous jobs because they didn't have enough education,\" he says. \n\"So they have no choice because of penny pinching pay from the British government.\"\nWhen he remembers the Gurkhas who died fighting for the British Army, Mr Gurung says he feels pain and his \"blood gets hot\".\n\"I remember those who were wounded in the war, after finished war they said 'You are wounded you are not fit for the army'. That's why they sent them back barefoot, empty-handed without pension. Once I remember those things it's really heart-breaking.\"\nOutside Downing Street, Mr Gurung looks tired. The days without food are taking their toll - but he says he has \"full hope, real optimism they will address our issues\".\n\"That's the reason I'm sacrificing my life,\" he says. \"There is no way they can run away from these issues because it is 207 years of historical injustice.\n\"Our message is let's form a high level of dialogue team, confirm the day for the dialogue. If they do that we will postpone our hunger strike.\n\"If they solve the problem we will stop. If they don't want to solve the problem I don't care even if I die because I already sacrificed my life.\"\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson says: \"We greatly value the huge contribution Gurkhas make to the British Army and ensure they are supported with a generous pension and medical care during retirement in Nepal.\n\"We are committed to ensuring the Gurkha Pension Scheme is sustainable and fair alongside other UK public sector pensions.\""

      "text": "Scotland's first electric-powered aircraft has taken to the skies from a new test centre in Orkney.\nOne of the twin engines in Ampaire's six-seater Cessna Skymaster has been replaced with an electric motor.\nThe company believes it could pave the way to retrofitting inter-island and short-haul flights with greener technologies.\nIt is the first low-carbon aircraft to fly at the \u00a33.7m sustainable aviation facility based at Kirkwall airport.\nThe plane was built in 1974 but has been retrofitted at the company's headquarters in California.\nAfter initial test flights in Hawaii, it was shipped to Scotland for its first flight across open water between Orkney and Wick, a 37-mile (60km) flight.\nTest pilot Justin Gillen told BBC Scotland: \"It's the only hybrid-electric airplane that I know of flying today. \n\"As the airplane is approaching, you hear the propeller which is a kind of blade-through-air sound and then you hear the throatier sound of the engine.  With our electric engine, you hear the propeller but that's pretty much it.\"\nOn Ampaire's aircraft, the engines are built at the front and back of the cockpit in a \"push-pull\" design.\nIt's the front engine which has been replaced with an electric motor that's a fraction of the size.\nA huge battery pack has been attached to the underbelly which can keep the aircraft running for several hours in the right conditions.\nAbout 90 minutes of rapid charging would provide around an hour of flight.\nSusan Ying from Ampaire said: \"It will fly cleaner, be more efficient and more economical.\n\"It will start as a short-haul but eventually, as the technology's improving, it could go into medium to long-haul.\"\nThat would require batteries to continue shrinking but the developers are confident that will happen.\nAir travel is a notoriously difficult industry to decarbonise because the aviation fuel has a high energy density.\nBut it's a high emitter of carbon dioxide which needs to be reduced to net-zero if we are to halt climate change.\nIsland air links in Scotland are regarded as \"lifeline\" for communities who live there, and so battery-powered flights are under serious consideration.\nDougie Cook, from Highlands and Islands Airports, explained: \"If aviation is to survive throughout the world, then it needs to decarbonise and it needs to do so quite quickly. So this is a really important first step.\n\"The links around Orkney are called lifeline links for a reason and it's absolutely essential that we keep them going so electric aviation will guarantee that and make it sustainable for the future.\"\nFlights currently operate from Kirkwall to six of the furthest islands - Eday, Sanday, Stronsay, North Ronaldsay, Westray and Papa Westray.\nThe test facility is expecting to play host to other forms of low-carbon flights, including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels."

      "tags": "Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Stormont Executive has agreed to a number of changes to Covid-19 rules, including the end of close contacts self-isolating if they are fully vaccinated.\nOther changes have been agreed for schools and the hospitality sector.\nClass bubbles will no longer be required from the start of term.\nThe rule-of-six - the number of people allowed to sit at tables together in pubs and restaurants - has also been scrapped.\nHowever, the executive stopped short of changing rules on social distancing or face coverings.\nPost-primary students will also still have to wear masks in class.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan said he hoped for a decision to lift all restrictions by the end of September and that the \"justification for regulations is diminishing\".\nHe also said he had hoped to see fewer restrictions for the hospitality sector in the latest changes and that it was time to move from a regulatory model to one of \"personal responsibility\". \nHowever, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive had taken a \"cautious approach\", which was \"fully supported by public health advice\".\nThe executive agreed to the changes to Covid-19 rules following discussion of a paper submitted by Health Minister Robin Swann.\nThe major change, to take affect from Monday (16 August), will see people who are notified as close contacts not having to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated.\nThey will still be advised to take a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) Covid test on day two and eight of the process.\nIf someone tests positive, they must continue to self-isolate, even if they do not have symptoms of the disease.\nPeople who started self-isolating before 16 August can stop on that date but only if they have been fully vaccinated.\nIt will bring Northern Ireland into line with England, where the change is also taking effect on Monday.\nThe move has already taken effect in Scotland and Wales. \nIn schools, class bubbles will no longer be required from the start of term.\nHowever, ministers have decided to retain face coverings for post-primary students in classrooms for the first six weeks of term.\nOther moves agreed by the executive include: \nIndoor premises and workplaces in Northern Ireland are still required to comply with a social distancing rule of at least 1m (3ft).\nThat rule has been lifted in other parts of the UK and many people in Northern Ireland's hospitality sector are keen to see it relaxed locally too. \nNightclubs also remain without a reopening date.\nThe executive will keep the measures under review. \nThe takeaway from today's executive meeting? The finishing line on restrictions is still not in sight. \nThe DUP is keen to move full steam ahead and scrap the rest of the rules before the end of next month, particularly as furlough and other support for hospitality businesses slip away. \nBut contrast its tone with other parties and health officials who are more hesitant, saying the vaccination rate and case numbers mean progress must be slower. \nThose arguments within the executive over regulations versus guidance and personal responsibility will continue.\n It feels, though, like it's soon going to have to come to a head.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan said he hoped the changes would go further for pubs and restaurants and indicated he hoped all restrictions could be lifted by the end of September. \nMr Givan, a Democratic Unionist Party assembly member, said the restrictions on social distancing and table service had affected the hospitality sector's sustainability.\n\"From my party's perspective, we're getting to the point that personal responsibility, taking informed decisions at an individual level, is how we need to address this.\n\"The justification for having regulations in place for this is diminishing and I don't think is proportionate.\"\nHe said the executive would revisit remaining regulations during meetings due to take place on the 1 September and 9 September.\nBut he said there would be no \"freedom day\" rhetoric.\n\"England portrayed what they were doing as a freedom day. If we look at the restrictions that we had two months ago to where we are today, we are well on the way now to narrowing that difference.\n\"Phrasing it though as freedom day is not language I think we're going to use, because we still want people to take that personal responsibility.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was at the peak of the current Covid wave, but that \"we should expect to see cases starting to come down over the next week\". \nShe said the executive had taken a \"cautious approach\", which was \"fully supported by public health advice\". \n\"I think what we're doing is proportionate to the current level of cases,\" she added.\n\"We'll have a better sense of where we are in the first week of September - that's when we revisit all the issues that have not been moved on today.\"\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member said vaccination was Northern Ireland's \"best defence\". \n\"We didn't reach the levels that we would have wanted, if you have compared us to England, Scotland and Wales, the south have now overtaken us. \n\"It's not about vaccine shaming, but anybody hasn't had the vaccine yet, we would encourage people to please take it up, it's the best thing we can do.\"\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the changes \"provides yet another example of the benefits of being fully vaccinated\". \nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen said the new rules should give schools more \"flexibility\" with pupils.\nDorothee Fassunge from Belfast restaurant L'Etoile du Nord said changes to self-isolation rules removed a risk that was \"hanging over the business\".\nSpeaking to BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme, she welcomed the end to the six person limit - although she said it would be awhile before she booked big groups. \n\"As a business owner it is, yes, about making money but it is personal responsibility for me too, for my staff and my customers, to ensure everybody is safe,\" she said. \nAaron McHenry, who manages The Elk in Toome, said the end of the rule-of-six  was \"great news\" adding: \"For any family event it's great everybody can come, sit together and eat together, which will help things along.\"\nIndustry bodies Hospitality Ulster and the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) both welcomed the relaxations but called on the executive to remove further restrictions, such as pubs being table service only as well as international travel restrictions. \nRetail NI's chief executive Glyn Roberts welcomed the move, saying the end to self-isolation would help businesses managing staff shortages.\nHowever, Angela McGowan, from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Northern Ireland, said Thursday's decision was a \"missed opportunity\" and that some would feel the changes \"haven't gone far enough\".\nMeanwhile, those from the care home sector also said it was unclear whether self-isolation rules would be relaxed for care home staff.\nJulie Ann McNally from Care Home Advice and Support NI said isolation had been \"shocking and traumatic\" for both care home residents and their families.\nThe executive's decisions came after it discussed a paper submitted by Health Minister Robin Swann, in which he said there were good reasons why Northern Ireland should follow the same self-isolation rules as the other parts of the UK.\nThe health minster stated that \"it is likely that the period of good weather in late July helped to suppress the virus transmission and this has now increased again as people have interacted indoors\".\nHe added that positive cases remain highest in the \"18-30 age band but are rising slowly in almost all age bands\". \nHe also told his ministerial colleagues that the Delta variant accounts for over 90% of all cases.\nThe health minister stressed to his colleagues that \"it is important to note that the position in Northern Ireland is significantly worse at present that the rest of the Common Travel Area (UK and the Republic of Ireland) in relation to case numbers, hospital pressures and vaccination status\".\nBut his paper added that his discussions with the chief scientific advisor and the Northern Ireland modelling group \"indicates the current wave of Covid 19 in Northern Ireland is either at peak or nearing its peak\"."

      "text": "The UK economy grew by 4.8% between April and June, according to official figures, as most businesses emerged from lockdown.\nData from the Office for National Statistics showed that the expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) was fuelled by retail, restaurants and hotels.\nEducation also boosted the economy as schools reopened in the second quarter.\nHowever, the figure was slightly below the 5% the Bank of England expected. \nThe UK economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic. \nGrowth in the second quarter contrasts with the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank by 1.6% while Covid restrictions were still in place. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: \"Today's figures show that the economy is recovering very strongly, exceeding many people's expectations.\n\"But I'm not complacent. The economy and our public finances have experienced a significant shock. It is going to take us time to fully recover from that.\"\nCapital Economics said it expected the economy to return to pre-Covid levels later this year.\n\"We are comfortable with our view that monthly GDP will return to its February 2020 pre-pandemic size by October and that the economy may yet surprise most forecasters by emerging from the pandemic without much scarring,\" said senior UK economist Ruth Gregory.\nIn April, non-essential retailers reopened, as well as gyms, hairdressers and outdoor dining. In May, pubs, restaurants and cafes were allowed to serve customers indoors, while theatres, galleries and cinemas were allowed to open their doors.\nThe main driver of growth was consumer spending, which rose by 7.3% over the quarter, ahead of expectations.\nThe UK is not just a nation of shopkeepers, but social animals. And it's that large proportion of \"social spending\" - on hotels, restaurants and leisure - that made our economy so vulnerable to lockdowns. The UK was the fastest shrinking of the G7 nations in 2020 and conversely, maybe one of the fastest of the big players to recover in 2021 as restrictions lift. \nThe consumer has led the way, driving output to within 5% of pre-pandemic levels, despite the Delta variant of Covid. It's growth that some feared just months ago would take far longer to materialise. \nBut what happens next is still uncertain. The safety net that has protected livelihoods - the furlough scheme - ends in October. Economists think there will be some job losses, albeit far fewer than assumed a year ago. \nThe biggest risk, however, will come from further variants and a resurgence in infections and restrictions. Policymakers are assuming we're done with the latter. A year ago, they were predicting there'd be no more national lockdowns: let's hope they're right this time. \nIf so, the impressive vaccination rate in the UK should stand the economy in good stead - others are not that fortunate. Be it health or wealth, it's access to vaccinations that may increasingly make the difference between the haves and have-nots as we try to escape the grip of this pandemic. \nAt the end of the quarter in June, the monthly growth is estimated at 1%, slightly more than most economists expected. \nPantheon Macroeconomics said that nearly half of the economic expansion in June came from activity in the health sector, \"reportedly due primarily to a surge in people visiting their GP\".\nHargreaves Lansdowne said: \"Fears that the arrival of the Delta variant and the 'pingdemic' that followed might impact growth have so far not really materialised.\" \nHowever, the ONS revised down its figure for May from 0.8% to 0.6% during a month of heavy rainfall. \nThe UK economy has been supported by the government's wage support scheme. But from July, employers have had to make contributions to staff wages and the scheme is set to close by the end of September.\nThe economy is rebounding, but the pandemic is still having an impact on the restaurant trade, according to Asma Khan, founder and owner of Darjeeling Express, a family-owned Indian restaurant in London's Covent Garden.\n\"It's been very tough,\" she told the BBC. \"The insecurity has been very hard to deal with, the way the lockdown happened in March of last year.\"\nMrs Khan said that she was \"grateful\" for the furlough scheme which allowed her to keep her entire staff on.\nEven so, \"I was still liable for all the rents and all the financial costs mounted up,\" she added.\nThere is, however, \"a lot of optimism\", Mrs Khan said. People are booking months in advance to dine at her restaurant, which recently welcomed comic actors Paul Rudd, of the US, and Canadian Dan Levy.   \n\"We had, I think, 1,300 bookings in five hours when we started opening all up all the other dates,\" she said.\nMrs Khan said the changing nature of the UK's travel restrictions remained a concern. She said businesses like hers in central London were \"completely dependent on tourists\".\n\"People are worried because this whole insecurity of the red list, the amber list. This fluctuation is basically deterring a lot of people, except the very brave, to want to come in because they don't know whether the status of their country is going to change by the time they're ready to go back.\"\nFollowing the release of second-quarter GDP figures, Mr Sunak said the UK had \"the fastest quarterly growth rate among the G7 economies\". \nBut Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \"The UK economy almost certainly was the hardest hit by Covid-19 in the G7.\"\nWhile UK GDP is still 4.4% smaller than its pre-pandemic level, the US has seen its economy recover, making it 0.8% larger than before Covid. \nPantheon also said France's economy was 3.3% below pre-pandemic levels, Germany was 3.6% below and Italy's GDP was 3.8% lower.\nJapan and Canada have yet to report up-to-date figures, but Pantheon said: \"Both economies had fared much better than the UK in previous quarters.\"  "

      "tags": "Archaeology,Newport,Dairy farming",
      "text": "Dairy farming could have been happening in Wales as early as 3,100BC, according to new research.\nShards of decorated pottery taken from the Trellyffaint Neolithic monument near Newport, Pembrokeshire, were found to contain dairy fat residue.\nThe residue could only originate from milk-based substances such as butter, cheese, or more probably yoghurt. \nGeorge Nash, of the Welsh Rock Art Organisation, said it was the earliest proof of dairy farming in Wales.\nProject leader Dr Nash said Julie Dunne of the University of Bristol had detected the dairy fat residues from the inner surfaces of the pottery, as well as dating them with 94.5% accuracy to 3,100BC.\n\"It's incredibly rare to find any archaeological remains such as bone and pottery in this part of Wales because of the soil's acidity,\" he said.  \n\"So, we can't say for certain that this is the earliest example of dairy farming, but it is the earliest that anyone has been able to prove, using new revolutionary direct dating methods. \n\"The discovery of this pottery is important because it is right on the cusp of when a new Neolithic ideology was taking hold.\"\nDr Nash, who teaches at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, termed the period a \"Neolithic package\" that included animal husbandry, pottery making, food procurement and different ways of burying and venerating the dead.\nIt gradually replaced the hunting, fishing and gathering way of life which had typified the previous era.\nInterest in Trellyffaint began when former University of Bristol archaeology graduates Les Dodds and Phil Dell conducted several geophysical surveys on and around the Neolithic stone chambers.\nThey discovered two concentric henges along with other buried objects. \nThe henges - two circular earthen banks - are roughly contemporary with Stonehenge, dating from the mid to latter part of the Neolithic period, between 3,000BC and 2,000BC. \nHowever, Dr Nash said it is important to view the period as a continuum of social and ritual development rather than a single event. \n\"As the population grew throughout this period, communities had to diversify the way in which they sourced their food,\" he explained.\n\"Initially, farming was a far riskier economy than hunting, fishing and gathering, as if you had one outbreak of disease - one crop failure - then you were prone to starvation and instability. \n\"It is probable that throughout the Neolithic period in western Britain, both natural resources and farming played equal roles in providing communities with the resources they needed.\n\"The pottery recovered from this excavation probably reveals something about the veneration of the earth and what it could provide, hence the offering of dairy products within a ritualised landscape\". \nThe survey discovered the main chamber was largely in a good state of preservation.\nHowever, at some point in the recent past, the enormous capstone covering the chamber had slipped off its supporting upright stones.\nUp to 75 engraved cupmarks - gouged circular indentations - and several intersecting lines were recorded on top of this stone.\nThe cupmarks, which feature on only a handful of Neolithic burial-ritual monuments in Wales, suggest the stone formed part of a new religious ideology where rock art represented the night sky and constellations. \nMaybe a few hundred years later, the community using Trellyffaint made the decision to yet again change their worldview, which resulted in the construction of the two concentric henges a few yards north of the monument.\nFor this new set of monuments, offering dairy products rather than looking towards the night sky became the new way of veneration. \nThe artefacts discovered will be presented to the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff for safekeeping, while the team's research is due for publication in several international scientific journals."

      "text": "A new analysis suggests the current level of UK spending to combat climate change is lagging behind what advisers say is needed.\nA study by the pressure group WWF says new green policies in the March 2021 Budget add up to just 0.01% of GDP.\nBut the government's own advisory Climate Change Committee has said 1% of national wealth - or GDP - must be spent every year in the UK to ensure climate targets are met.\nIn November the prime minister promised \u00a312bn for a 10-point plan \"green industrial revolution\".\nWWF says its research also shows that some Budget policies that encourage pollution totalled \u00a340bn - far more than the PM's green plan.\nIt says that the freeze on fuel duty is costing the Treasury some \u00a311.2bn in the financial year 2019-20 alone, rising to \u00a313.9bn in 2022-23 if the freeze continues.\nA Treasury spokesman defended the government's record and said a comprehensive strategy for financing the \"green revolution\" would be outlined in the autumn.\nBut WWF says the UK won't remotely deliver on its own promise of a 78% CO2 cut by 2035 at the current rate of annual spending.\nIsabella O'Dowd from WWF said: \"It's not yet too late to prevent global warming from rising above 1.5\u00b0C - it is in our hands.\n\"But to do that, the UK government must play its part by keeping every climate promise it has made.\"\nThe government's aim is to reduce UK emissions to almost nil by 2050 - that's a trajectory the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said would save the world from the very worst catastrophes that lie ahead.\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"\"The UK is a world leader in the global effort to tackle climate change, growing our economy by 78% while cutting emissions by 44% over the past three decades and being the first major economy to legislate to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\"\nThe government has been urged recently by some of its own backbench MP to spell out exactly how the low-carbon transition will be funded. They fear the UK may take expensive action to cut emissions when other nations sit back.\nThe Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC recently that policies to shield poor families from higher heating bills would be published soon.\nChris Stark, head of the advisory Climate Change Committee, told BBC News the WWF report is \"an interesting snapshot\" of government spending on the net zero transition.\nHe continued: \"We estimate the cost of reaching net zero to be around 1% of GDP per year, a mixture of public and private money.\n\"Not all of that funding will be reflected in the government's Budget, but it's vital that a net zero test is applied to the Treasury spending review in the Autumn if we are to have a fighting chance of delivering net zero.\"\nRecent analysis for the All-Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group suggests the government is also falling short at a policy level on net zero ambitions.\nIts report said ministers have fully or partially met just 61 out of 135 policies recommended by the advisory Climate Change Committee. \nThe prime minister has promised a full suite of policies before the vital climate summit known as COP26 that he's hosting in Glasgow in November.\nExperts say if the UK must prove how it can decarbonise its own economy to show other nations that it's economically possible.\nOne of the government's new policy initiatives is to promote hydrogen as a power source. A hydrogen strategy is due soon.\nLobby groups are pressing for widespread hydrogen use in home heating.\nBut a report from Cornell and Stanford Universities warns that using hydrogen could increase emissions overall unless it's made by electrolysis from surplus wind power.\nThat's because the most common current method of getting hydrogen is to split it from natural gas, which produces high carbon emissions.\nFollow Roger @rharrabin"

      "text": "The Taliban fighters we meet are stationed just 30 minutes from one of Afghanistan's largest cities, Mazar-i-Sharif.\nThe \"ghanimat\" or spoils of war they're showing off include a Humvee, two pick-up vans and a host of powerful machine guns. Ainuddin, a stony-faced former madrassa (religious school) student who's now a local military commander, stands at the centre of a heavily-armed crowd.  \nThe insurgents have been capturing new territory on what seems like a daily basis as international troops have all but withdrawn. Caught in the middle is a terrified population. \nTens of thousands of ordinary Afghans have had to flee their homes - hundreds have been killed or injured in recent weeks. \nI ask Ainuddin how he can justify the violence, given the pain it's inflicting on the people he claims to be fighting on behalf of?  \n\"It's fighting, so people are dying,\" he replies coolly, adding that the group is trying its best \"not to harm civilians\".  \nI point out that the Taliban are the ones who have started the fighting. \n\"No,\" he retorts. \"We had a government and it was overthrown. They [the Americans] started the fighting.\"  \nAinuddin and the rest of the Taliban feel momentum is with them, and that they are on the cusp of returning to dominance after being toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001. \n\"They are not giving up Western culture\u2026 so we have to kill them,\" he says of the \"puppet government\" in Kabul.  \nShortly after we finish speaking we hear the sound of helicopters above us. The Humvee and the Taliban fighters quickly disperse. It's a reminder of the continuing threat the Afghan air force poses to the insurgents, and that the battle is still far from over.  \nWe're in Balkh, a town with ancient roots, thought to be the birthplace of one of Islam's most famous mystic poets, Jalaluddin Rumi. \nWe passed through here earlier this year, when it was still controlled by the government, but the outlying villages were held by the Taliban. Now it's one of around 200 district centres to have been captured by the militants in this latest, unprecedented offensive. \nOne senior Taliban official said the focus in the north had been deliberate - not only because the region has traditionally seen strong anti-Taliban resistance, but also because it is more diverse. \nDespite its core leadership being heavily dominated by members of the Pashtun majority, the official said the Taliban wanted to emphasise they incorporated other ethnicities too.\nHaji Hekmat, a local Taliban leader and our host in Balkh, is keen to show us how daily life is still continuing. \nYoung schoolgirls throng the streets (though elsewhere there are reports of girls being banned from attending). The bazaar remains crowded, with both male and female shoppers. \nWe had been told by local sources that women were allowed to attend only with a male companion, but when we visit that does not seem to be the case. Elsewhere Taliban commanders have reportedly been far stricter.  \nAll the women we see, however, are wearing the all-encompassing burqa, covering both their hair and face. \nHaji Hekmat insists no-one is being \"forced\" and that the Taliban are simply \"preaching\" that this is how women should dress. \nBut I've been told taxi drivers have been given instructions not to drive any woman into the town unless she's fully veiled.  \nThe day after we leave, reports emerge of a young woman being murdered because of her clothing. Haji Hekmat, though, rejects allegations Taliban members were responsible.  \nMany in the bazaar express their support for the group and their gratitude towards them for improving security. But with Taliban fighters accompanying us at all times, it's difficult to know what residents really think.  \nThe group's hardline views are at times in tune with more conservative Afghans, but the Taliban are now pushing for control of a number of larger cities. \nIn the shadow of Mazar-e-Sharif's intricately tiled Blue Mosque, men and women strolled around last week in a visibly more relaxed social atmosphere. \nThe government are still in control in the city and almost everyone I spoke to expressed concern about what the Taliban's resurgence will mean, particularly for the \"freedoms\" younger generations have grown up with. \nBut back in Balkh district the Taliban are formalising their own rival government. They've taken over all the official buildings in the town, bar one large, now abandoned police compound. \nIt used to be the headquarters of a bitter rival, the local police chief, and was partly destroyed in a suicide bombing by the militants as they fought for control of the area.\nThe face of the Taliban's district governor, Abdullah Manzoor, lights up with a broad grin when he talks about the operation, whilst his men chuckle. The fight here, as in so many places in Afghanistan, is deeply personal as well as ideological.  \nSome things haven't changed since the Taliban takeover; orange-clad street cleaners are still reporting for work, as are some bureaucrats. They're overseen by a newly appointed Taliban mayor, seated at a broad wooden desk, with a small white flag of the \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\" positioned in one corner. \nHe used to be in charge of ammunition supplies, now it's taxes - and he tells me proudly the group charges business owners less than the government used to. \nThe transition from military to civilian life is a work in progress, though. A Taliban fighter still grasping his gun, who moves to pose behind the mayor during our interview, is ushered away by more senior figures.  \nIn other places, however, the insurgents' hardline interpretation of Islamic scripture is more visible. At the local radio station, they used to play a mixture of Islamic music and general popular hits. \nNow it's only religious chants. Haji Hekmat says they banned music promoting \"vulgarity\" from being played in public, but insists individuals can still listen to what they want.  \nI've been told, however, of a local man being caught listening to music in the bazaar. To punish him, Taliban fighters are said to have made him walk barefoot in the baking sun, until he lost consciousness. \nHaji Hekmat insists no such thing happened. As we leave the station, he gestures to some of the young men working there, pointing out they don't have beards. \n\"See! We're not forcing anyone,\" he says, grinning.  \nIt's clear the group do want to portray a softer image to the world. But in other parts of the country the Taliban are reported to be behaving much more strictly. The differences may depend on the attitudes of local commanders. \nWith reports of extra-judicial revenge killings and other human rights abuses in some of the areas they've captured, the Taliban have been warned by Western officials they risk turning the country into a pariah state if they try to seize it by force.  \nWhat many associate most closely with the Taliban's previous stint in power, is the brutal punishments meted out under their interpretation of Sharia law.  \nLast month in the southern province of Helmand, the group hanged two men accused of child kidnapping from a bridge, justifying it by saying the men had been convicted.  \nIn Balkh, on the day we visit a Taliban court session, all the cases are related to land disputes. Whilst many fear their form of justice, for others it at least offers the possibility of a quicker resolution than the notoriously corrupt government system. \n\"I've had to pay so many bribes,\" complains one of the litigants as he discusses his previous attempts to resolve the case.  \nThe Taliban judge, Haji Badruddin, says he's not yet ordered any corporal punishment in the four months he's been in office, and emphasises the group has a system of appeal courts to review serious verdicts. \nBut he defends even the harshest penalties. \"In our Sharia it's clear, for those who have sex and are unmarried, whether it's a girl or a boy, the punishment is 100 lashes in public.\n\"But for anyone who's married, they have to be stoned to death\u2026 For those who steal: if it's proved, then his hand should be cut off.\"  \nHe pushes back against criticism of the punishments as incompatible with the modern world. \n\"People's children are being kidnapped. Is that better? Or is it better that one person's hand is chopped off and stability is brought in the community?\" \n\u202fFor now, despite the Taliban's rapid advance, the government remains in control of Afghanistan's biggest cities. The coming months are likely to see protracted and increasingly deadly violence as the two sides wrestle for control. \nI ask Haji Hekmat if he's sure the Taliban can win militarily? \"Yes,\" he replies. \"If peace talks are not successful, we will win, God willing.\"  \nThose talks however, have stalled, and the Taliban's repeated demand for the creation of an \"Islamic government\" appears tantamount to a call for their opponents to surrender. \n \"We have defeated both the foreigners,\" says Haji Hekmat, \"and now our internal enemies.\""

      "tags": "GCSEs,Rhyl,A-levels,Welsh government,Abergele,Wales education,Exams",
      "text": "The number of top grades given out at GCSE in Wales has increased for the second year running, according to the official results published on Thursday.\nA total of 28.7% A and A* grades were awarded, compared with 18.4% when exams were last held in 2019.\nGrades were decided by teachers after exams were scrapped due to Covid-19.\nThe education minister said pupils had shown \"tremendous resilience\" to overcome the pandemic's challenges.  \nMeanwhile 73.6% achieved at least C grade or above, roughly the same as 2020 but again a sharp rise on 2019.\nDespite being at home with \"a house full of children running around\", Elin, 16, got 12 A* grades at Ysgol Glan Clwyd in St Asaph.\nShe said she felt overwhelmed, adding: \"I'm one of six, which made it much harder and a lot more stressful. \n\"But I got through it.\"\nHer fellow pupil at the Denbighshire school, Alaw, also 16, said: \"It's been a challenging year, getting the motivation to get out of bed, on the laptop and do the work.\"\nShe said she preferred going to school and missed the social side of it, but was happy with her grades - two As, five Bs and four Cs. \nQualifications Wales said it had been a \"difficult year for everyone in education\".\nBut chief executive Philip Blaker added: \"Learners can be confident that the qualifications awarded in Wales this year carry the same value as qualifications awarded in any other year.\"\nIt is a similar pattern to the higher grades seen on Tuesday, when almost half of A-level results were A*s and As.\nWales overtook England for top GCSE grades, although the system is different.\nThe exam results also showed:\nEducation Minister Jeremy Miles said: \"My message to this year's GCSE students is a huge 'well done'. \n\"You've had everything thrown at you over the last 18 months - periods in lockdown, time away from your friends and families, and times where you've missed out on many of the social activities you should be enjoying.\" \nThere is a widening gap at the top grades between students from poorer backgrounds and others. There was a 11.5 percentage points difference at A* between those who were eligible for free school meals and those who do not. \nThis has grown by 2.8 percentage points on last year and has widened by 6.2 percentage points on 2019.\nQualifications Wales said a similar pattern was observed at A*-A, while the A*-C attainment gap also widened in 2021.\nSo, 52% of pupils who were eligible for free school meals got grades between A* and C, but that rises to 79.3% for pupils not eligible - the gap growing to 27.3%, when it had narrowed slightly to 24.2% the year before.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales, Mr Miles said there had been \"considerably better achievement for all groups of learners\".\nBut he said there was \"clearly\" an attainment gap: \"Covid has had an impact on that and we can see that in some of the results.\"\n\"For the next school year we've got significant sums of money to help schools respond to the impact of Covid\" which will be focused on \"disadvantaged learners\", he added.\nBoys achieved 10.7 percentage points more A grades than girls, up from 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and 7.4 in 2019.\nStudents this year received their provisional results back in June, so that they had the option to appeal their grades before they were finalised. \nBoth the provisional and final grades were decided by teachers, and so there will likely be less variation than previous years when exams played a significant role.\nTalking percentages and grades up or down is familiar on results day, but in a pandemic, inevitably, it is all about the context.\nIn the absence of exams, teachers determined grades and, like A-level results, they have been higher than when exams were last held in 2019.\nSo do the Wales-wide GCSE results tell us anything useful?\nNot really about relative performance with other years, but there's plenty to un-pick.\nThe spike in the last two years' figures will colour discussions about how the expected transition back to exams happens next year.\nAnd then there's the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates - always significant but even bigger under this year's system.\nConservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones paid tribute to the \"tremendous work\" of pupils and said it was now important that the Welsh government outlined the roadmap for the new academic year and \"provided clarity for teachers, pupils and parents\".\nLaura Doel, director of the head teachers' union NAHT Cymru, said: \"We should all have the confidence that these results were awarded through a rigorous evidenced-based process by the people who know them best academically - their teachers.\n\"We cannot underestimate the role of schools in this process and our whole education workforce should be commended for all they have done to support learners.\"\nDavid Evans, Wales secretary of the National Education Union Cymru said the circumstances had been \"exceptionally challenging.\"\nHe added: \"For next year, we need a back-up plan in place, to avoid a repeat of the chaos and significant unnecessary workload, pressure, and stress experienced this summer.\"\nBefore results were published on Thursday morning, teaching union Ucac said there were \"huge questions\" about whether \"a barrage\" of formal exams at 16 was now necessary.\nBut exams \"definitely have their place\" in assessing pupils in future, Qualifications Wales said.\nDavid Jones, chairman of Qualifications Wales, disagreed and insisted examinations should remain part of a range of assessment methods.\nHe said different forms of assessment had been developing over recent years and this had increased during the pandemic.\nHe added that there was an \"unique opportunity\" as part of the new Welsh curriculum to look at new approaches, but experience of exams was important.\n\"A lot of learners, but not all learners, go on to university and higher education and they do examinations at university,\" he said.\n\"I think we would be letting them down if we didn't give them some preparation for examinations by doing them at schools and colleges and, of course, many of our learners move on from degrees to do professional qualifications.\"\nQualifications Wales said exams, alongside other forms of assessment, \"remain the fairest way to assess a learner's level of attainment\".\nLouise Casella, director of the Open University in Wales, chaired an independent review into what went wrong with the awarding of qualifications last summer, which also made some broader recommendations.\nShe said the group believed exams were not \"the be all and end all\" and any system should give pupils \"the very best opportunity to show what it is they've learned\".\n\"I think we all have visions of exams as being lined up in exam halls, desk behind desk - it doesn't have to be that way,\" she added.\nWhile agreeing there was a place for \"some common assessment of learning\" she said there should be \"multiple points of reference throughout the year\".\nQualifications at 16 are being looked at as part of the new curriculum being rolled out from 2022, with the first new-look GCSEs to be completed in 2027.\nQualifications Wales said the GCSE brand should be kept, but it has been consulting on how exactly they will work. \nPlaid Cymru said last year it would scrap GCSEs and replace them with a system based on teacher assessment.\nThe Conservatives said they believed exams remained \"the fairest and best form of assessment\" and hoped to see them return as soon as practically possible.\nTeachers' union Ucac said \"removing, or significantly reducing\" GCSE requirements would free up time for learning and minimise stress on young people.\n\"There are huge questions about the purpose and suitability of GCSEs,\" the union's deputy general secretary Rebecca Williams said.\n\"It's not at all clear that a barrage of formal, external exams at 16 is necessary any more\". \nShe said the new curriculum meant \"a major change to the GCSE system is needed\".\nDavid Evans, Wales secretary for National Education Union Cymru, said there were already some elements of coursework at GCSE.\n\"It is arguably a better and fairer reflection of someone's capabilities to take a holistic view of what they know and can do, than to take a snapshot through exams\", he said.\n\"But any changes need to have plenty of time and resources, to ensure we don't increase the workload for staff and students alike.\""

      "text": "After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan.\nThe group completed their shockingly rapid advance across the country by capturing Kabul on 15 August.\nIt came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001.\nThe conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.\nTaliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West.\nBut questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms.\nBack in 2001, the US was responding to the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. \nBin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996.\nWhen they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat.\nThe militants slipped away and later regrouped.\nNato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued. President Barack Obama's \"troop surge\" in 2009 helped push back the Taliban but it was not long term.\nIn 2014, at the end of what was the bloodiest year since 2001, Nato's international forces ended their combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to the Afghan army.\nThat gave the Taliban momentum and they seized more territory. \nPeace talks between the US and the Taliban started tentatively, with the Afghan government pretty much uninvolved, and the agreement on a withdrawal came in February 2020 in Qatar.\nThe US-Taliban deal did not stop the Taliban attacks - they switched their focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and targeted assassinations. Their areas of control grew.\nThey emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas.\nThey vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam.\nBy 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country. \nThey enforced their own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduced brutal punishments. Men were made to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. TV, music and cinema were banned.\nAfter their overthrow they regrouped in Pakistani border areas.\nIn terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians.\nResearch by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000. It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each.\nMore than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured.\nAccording to the UN, Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. \nSince 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. \nBrown University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (\u00a3706bn) up to 2020.\nHow the Taliban plan to govern Afghanistan remains unclear.\nWomen face an uncertain future. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities \"as per Afghan norms and Islamic values\".\nThe militants had declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government.\nBut there are fears over women's freedom to work, to dress as they choose, or even to leave home alone under Taliban rule. \nAnother major fear is that the country will once again become a training ground for terrorism.\nTaliban officials insist that they will fully adhere to the US deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against the US and its allies.\nThey say they aim only to implement an \"Islamic government\" and will not pose a threat to any other country.\nBut many analysts say the Taliban and al-Qaeda are inseparable, with the latter's fighters heavily embedded and engaged in training activity.\nIt is also important to remember that the Taliban are not a centralised and unified force. Some leaders may want to keep the West muted by not stirring up trouble but hardliners may be reluctant to break links with al-Qaeda.\nJust how powerful al-Qaeda is and whether it could now rebuild its global network is also unclear.\nThen there is the regional branch of the Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - which the Taliban oppose.\nLike al-Qaeda, ISKP has been degraded by the US and Nato but could use the post-withdrawal period to regroup.\nIts fighter numbers could be only between a few hundred and 2,000 but it may try to gain footholds in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Tajikistan, which could be a serious regional concern.

      "tags": "COP26,North Sea oil and gas,Climate change,Oil & Gas industry,Aberdeen",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has written to the prime minister to urge him to reassess the development of a new North Atlantic oil field west of Shetland.\nThe first minister said proposals for the Cambo field should be re-examined over \"the severity of the climate emergency\".\nHer letter comes after a UN report issued a \"code red for humanity\".\nThe UK government wants to reduce the use of fossil fuels, but says there is still \"ongoing demand\" for oil and gas. \nIn her letter, Ms Sturgeon asked Boris Johnson to commit to \"significantly enhancing the climate conditionality\" associated with offshore oil and gas production.\nShe added: \"I am also asking that the UK government agrees to reassess licences already issued but where field development has not yet commenced. That would include the proposed Cambo development.\n\"Such licences, some of them issued many years ago, should be reassessed in light of the severity of the climate emergency we now face, and against a compatibility checkpoint that is fully aligned with our climate change targets and obligations.\"\nThe first minister's intervention is her first on the issue.\nMs Sturgeon also urged the prime minister to host to a four-nations conference ahead of November's COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nEnvironmental groups have accused ministers of \"hypocrisy\" over the summit, after it emerged that the Cambo development could get the green light.\nThe oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of Shetland in water depths of between 1,050m to 1,100m. It contains more than 800 million barrels of oil.  \nWhen asked about Cambo during a visit to Scotland last week, the prime minister told BBC Scotland that contracts should not be \"ripped up\".\nBut Mr Johnson added that \"we need to transition as fast as we reasonably can\" to renewable energy sources.\nThe UK government says the original exploration licence for Cambo dates back to 2001. This licence granted permission to search for oil and gas in the area.\nThere is then a lengthy process - involving field development plans, environmental statements and approval from relevant bodies - before production activity can begin.\nIf approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at Cambo could start as early as 2022. The field is expected to produce oil and gas for approximately 25 years. \nNicola Sturgeon has been sitting on the fence on Cambo and today she edged towards coming off it. \nWhile her reassessment call is not a straightforward \"no\" to the new field, it does lean in that direction.\nIt is hard to imagine how Cambo and projects like it would pass \"robust\" new climate tests, as proposed by the first minister. \nIf that amounts to a \"presumption against\" new oil and gas extraction it would be a major policy shift. \nIt's not so long since the Scottish government endorsed plans to extract maximum remaining value from the North Sea and the SNP has championed the oil industry for decades. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon has stopped short of outright opposition because she knows that jobs, investments and energy security are also at stake. \nGreenpeace UK branded Ms Sturgeon's letter a \"PR exercise\" and called on the first minister to make her \"own stance clear\".\nCampaigner Sam Chetan-Walsh said: \"The first minister must stop hiding behind Boris Johnson. If she wants to show leadership on climate she must clearly say, 'Stop Cambo'.\"\nScottish Labour net-zero spokeswoman Monica Lennon said the first minister had taken \"a baby step\" towards having a position.\nShe added: \"Now is not the time to reassess. It's time for Nicola Sturgeon to firmly and loudly oppose Cambo, once and for all.\"\nScottish Green environment spokesman Mark Ruskell said: \"It is welcome to see the Scottish government start to come off the fence when it comes to the Cambo oil field.\n\"But it is clear there are still far too many hopes pinned on the oil and gas industry to get us out of the climate emergency.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the first minister was putting a \"nationalist alliance with the Greens\" ahead of the economy.\nScottish Conservative Net Zero spokesman Liam Kerr added:  \"The oil and gas sector supports over 100,000 Scottish jobs and the development of the Cambo field could create thousands more. \n\"It's a real shame the SNP government are too busy virtue signalling to work with the industry on the transition to renewables, as the UK government are doing.\"\nIndustry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said the sector was \"committed\" to the Scottish and UK climate targets.\nOGUK energy policy manager, Will Webster, added: \"Regarding Cambo and other future oil and gas investments, it is already demonstrated in projections by government and independent agencies that these are compatible with net zero.\"\nA UK government spokeswoman said it was supporting the oil and gas industry's transition to green energy by 2050.\nShe said: \"Even though demand for fossil fuels is falling and we continue to break records on our use of renewable energy, the advice of the independent Climate Change Committee is that we will continue to need oil and gas in the coming years as it is still vital to the production of many everyday essentials like medicines.\n\"We have already ended support for fossil fuels overseas, and are already designing a climate compatibility checkpoint which will ensure any future licences will only be granted if they are aligned with the UK's climate change objectives.\""

      "tags": "Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Stormont Executive has agreed to a number of changes to Covid-19 rules, including the end of close contacts self-isolating if they are fully vaccinated.\nOther changes have been agreed for schools and the hospitality sector.\nClass bubbles will no longer be required from the start of term.\nThe rule-of-six - the number of people allowed to sit at tables together in pubs and restaurants - has also been scrapped.\nHowever, the executive stopped short of changing rules on social distancing or face coverings.\nPost-primary students will also still have to wear masks in class.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan said he hoped for a decision to lift all restrictions by the end of September and that the \"justification for regulations is diminishing\".\nHe also said he had hoped to see fewer restrictions for the hospitality sector in the latest changes and that it was time to move from a regulatory model to one of \"personal responsibility\". \nHowever, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive had taken a \"cautious approach\", which was \"fully supported by public health advice\".\nThe executive agreed to the changes to Covid-19 rules following discussion of a paper submitted by Health Minister Robin Swann.\nThe major change, to take affect from Monday (16 August), will see people who are notified as close contacts not having to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated.\nThey will still be advised to take a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) Covid test on day two and eight of the process.\nIf someone tests positive, they must continue to self-isolate, even if they do not have symptoms of the disease.\nPeople who started self-isolating before 16 August can stop on that date but only if they have been fully vaccinated.\nIt will bring Northern Ireland into line with England, where the change is also taking effect on Monday.\nThe move has already taken effect in Scotland and Wales. \nIn schools, class bubbles will no longer be required from the start of term.\nHowever, ministers have decided to retain face coverings for post-primary students in classrooms for the first six weeks of term.\nOther moves agreed by the executive include: \nIndoor premises and workplaces in Northern Ireland are still required to comply with a social distancing rule of at least 1m (3ft).\nThat rule has been lifted in other parts of the UK and many people in Northern Ireland's hospitality sector are keen to see it relaxed locally too. \nNightclubs also remain without a reopening date.\nThe executive will keep the measures under review. \nThe takeaway from today's executive meeting? The finishing line on restrictions is still not in sight. \nThe DUP is keen to move full steam ahead and scrap the rest of the rules before the end of next month, particularly as furlough and other support for hospitality businesses slip away. \nBut contrast its tone with other parties and health officials who are more hesitant, saying the vaccination rate and case numbers mean progress must be slower. \nThose arguments within the executive over regulations versus guidance and personal responsibility will continue.\n It feels, though, like it's soon going to have to come to a head.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan said he hoped the changes would go further for pubs and restaurants and indicated he hoped all restrictions could be lifted by the end of September. \nMr Givan, a Democratic Unionist Party assembly member, said the restrictions on social distancing and table service had affected the hospitality sector's sustainability.\n\"From my party's perspective, we're getting to the point that personal responsibility, taking informed decisions at an individual level, is how we need to address this.\n\"The justification for having regulations in place for this is diminishing and I don't think is proportionate.\"\nHe said the executive would revisit remaining regulations during meetings due to take place on the 1 September and 9 September.\nBut he said there would be no \"freedom day\" rhetoric.\n\"England portrayed what they were doing as a freedom day. If we look at the restrictions that we had two months ago to where we are today, we are well on the way now to narrowing that difference.\n\"Phrasing it though as freedom day is not language I think we're going to use, because we still want people to take that personal responsibility.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was at the peak of the current Covid wave, but that \"we should expect to see cases starting to come down over the next week\". \nShe said the executive had taken a \"cautious approach\", which was \"fully supported by public health advice\". \n\"I think what we're doing is proportionate to the current level of cases,\" she added.\n\"We'll have a better sense of where we are in the first week of September - that's when we revisit all the issues that have not been moved on today.\"\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member said vaccination was Northern Ireland's \"best defence\". \n\"We didn't reach the levels that we would have wanted, if you have compared us to England, Scotland and Wales, the south have now overtaken us. \n\"It's not about vaccine shaming, but anybody hasn't had the vaccine yet, we would encourage people to please take it up, it's the best thing we can do.\"\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the changes \"provides yet another example of the benefits of being fully vaccinated\". \nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen said the new rules should give schools more \"flexibility\" with pupils.\nDorothee Fassunge from Belfast restaurant L'Etoile du Nord said changes to self-isolation rules removed a risk that was \"hanging over the business\".\nSpeaking to BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme, she welcomed the end to the six person limit - although she said it would be awhile before she booked big groups. \n\"As a business owner it is, yes, about making money but it is personal responsibility for me too, for my staff and my customers, to ensure everybody is safe,\" she said. \nAaron McHenry, who manages The Elk in Toome, said the end of the rule-of-six  was \"great news\" adding: \"For any family event it's great everybody can come, sit together and eat together, which will help things along.\"\nIndustry bodies Hospitality Ulster and the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) both welcomed the relaxations but called on the executive to remove further restrictions, such as pubs being table service only as well as international travel restrictions. \nRetail NI's chief executive Glyn Roberts welcomed the move, saying the end to self-isolation would help businesses managing staff shortages.\nHowever, Angela McGowan, from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Northern Ireland, said Thursday's decision was a \"missed opportunity\" and that some would feel the changes \"haven't gone far enough\".\nMeanwhile, those from the care home sector also said it was unclear whether self-isolation rules would be relaxed for care home staff.\nJulie Ann McNally from Care Home Advice and Support NI said isolation had been \"shocking and traumatic\" for both care home residents and their families.\nThe executive's decisions came after it discussed a paper submitted by Health Minister Robin Swann, in which he said there were good reasons why Northern Ireland should follow the same self-isolation rules as the other parts of the UK.\nThe health minster stated that \"it is likely that the period of good weather in late July helped to suppress the virus transmission and this has now increased again as people have interacted indoors\".\nHe added that positive cases remain highest in the \"18-30 age band but are rising slowly in almost all age bands\". \nHe also told his ministerial colleagues that the Delta variant accounts for over 90% of all cases.\nThe health minister stressed to his colleagues that \"it is important to note that the position in Northern Ireland is significantly worse at present that the rest of the Common Travel Area (UK and the Republic of Ireland) in relation to case numbers, hospital pressures and vaccination status\".\nBut his paper added that his discussions with the chief scientific advisor and the Northern Ireland modelling group \"indicates the current wave of Covid 19 in Northern Ireland is either at peak or nearing its peak\"."

      "text": "More than 180 nurses resigned from Northern Ireland's largest health trust in the first half of this year, BBC News NI has learned.\nFigures from the Belfast Trust show 315 nurses left between 1 January and 31 July for various reasons. \nMore than half (182) resigned, while 81 nurses retired and 21 transferred within the health service.\nA total of 533 nurses left all of the trusts during that time period but only the Belfast Trust gave a breakdown.\nA nursing union says it is angry and worried about the growing number of members leaving the profession.\nRita Devlin, acting director of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said it was now a safety issue as there were not enough nurses to give patients the care they needed. \nA nursing agency said the number of new registrations it received during the first six months of this year was up by about 10% compared to the same time last year.  \nThe Department of Health said the 533 leavers figure would include retirees and nurses moving to other health and social care organisations.\n\"This level of leavers in recent years is commensurate with the size and composition of the workforce,\" the department said.\nKatharine Walker left the health service in June 2020 - several months after the start of the pandemic. \nSpeaking to BBC News NI, she said she wanted a work-life balance, which was not possible when mostly working nights. \n\"I loved my time working within the NHS but I was only there for four years and I was exhausted. \n\"I can't imagine how the staff are coping at the minute working with Covid and everything else.\n\"I worked in ICU [intensive care unit] and I worked with really incredible people who are so passionate about their job and the things you are seeing are almost indescribable at times.\"\nMs Walker joined an agency, which she says has given her flexibility and the \"slightly\" better pay means she can work fewer hours.\nShe is inundated with requests to work at the minute.\n\"All the hospitals are looking staff,\" she said.\n\"Some wards are really on their knees and it's hard because it plays on your good nature as a nurse because you want to help out but ultimately you have to look after yourself too.\"\nShe doesn't blame management for the staffing issues.\n\"They don't have enough staff to manoeuvre - so maybe if the staffing was there it would help,\" she added.\nMs Devlin said the RCN had been on the record for at least a decade over nursing shortages.  \n\"They are starting to vote with their feet and they are leaving some of the high-pressure areas to go to other places or indeed to go and work for agencies,\" she said.\nKieran McCormick, managing director of Balmoral Healthcare, said nurses were leaving the health service and joining the independent sector so they could be more in control of the hours they work.   \nMr McCormick, who once worked for the health service, said nurses wanted to be respected and generally felt \"fed up and done\".  \n\"I believe the executive is trying to fix it but it's about the whole package - paying them good wages, offering nurses flexible working and allowing them to move around and progress within the system,\" he said.\nChief nursing officer Charlotte McArdle acknowledged that staff shortages were not something that could be \"fixed overnight\" but that a \"clear plan\" for recruitment had been put in place.\nShe also told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the safety of patients and nurses on wards was paramount.\n\"Any unit that would be unsafe, steps would be taken to ensure that position is rectified and there are a number of things that can be done to make that happen,\" she said.\n\"Bringing in additional staff, closing beds where they have to to maintain a safe staffing level, deploying other staff into that unit, there are steps that can be taken on a daily basis.\n\"Nursing is a safety-critical profession, I would agree with my colleagues in the RCN on that point, but steps are being taken to ensure that safety is maintained and that can be challenging at times but that is a requirement.\" \nPatricia McKeown, regional secretary of the union Unison, said the figures reflected \"the serious pressure that nurses are under working within a health service that is understaffed and under-resourced\".\nShe said that while many nurses would have moved within the health service, a significant number would have chosen to leave the NHS to work for nursing agencies, with pay a \"major factor in that decision\".\n\"These agencies charge a premium to cover staff shortages across the health service whilst vacancies remain unfilled,\" she said.  \nShe said the executive must make pay a priority.\nOut of the nurses who left the Belfast Health Trust, 16 were from the intensive care unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital.  \nThe figures for all leavers from the other trusts are:\nBBC News NI also asked about unfilled posts. \nNot all of the health trusts could provide answers within the time requested, but according to the Southern Trust it has 255 unfilled posts. There are 150 in the Northern Trust. \nThe Department of Health said there were 18,449 registered nurses and midwives with a staff turnover rate of about 1,000 registrants per annum, \"which has been consistent for the past three years\".\n\"It should be pointed out however that this does not represent a reduction in overall staff numbers as the nursing and midwifery workforce has grown by 4.4% from March 2020,\" the department said.\nA spokesperson said the department had been addressing nursing shortages over the past five years through a range of measures.\n\"Since April 2020, over 3,800 new appointments have been made across Health and Social Care services, of which almost 2,200 are Health and Social Care appointments,\" they added.\n\"In addition, we have maintained the highest ever number of pre-registration nurse training places for this year - 1,325.\""

Foreign teams are helping to tackle blazes in what Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has described as a \"nightmarish summer\". \nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. \nOn Monday the UN released a major report saying human activity was making extreme weather events more common."

However, Network Rail's interim report found that the train \"struck a pile of washed-out rock and gravel before derailing\".\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch has said there was \"near-continuous heavy rain\" in the area between around 05.50 and 09:00 on the day of the crash, which caused \"significant flooding\".\nThe 51.5mm (2in) of rain that fell in this period was almost 75% of the monthly total in Aberdeenshire in an average August.\nBut it was \"dry and sunny\" when the derailment happened at 09.37. The minute's silence is being held at 09:43 - the time the crash was first reported.\nThe train was returning towards Aberdeen at the time of the accident due to the railway being blocked. It was travelling at around 73mph - below the maximum permitted speed of 75mph for that section of track - when it struck the debris and derailed to the left, destroying a bridge barrier.\nCustomers will be made aware of the silence through messages on boards around the country and onboard announcements.\nAlex Hynes, ScotRail's managing director, said: \"Everyone at Scotland's Railway will always be broken-hearted about the terrible accident at Stonehaven.\n\"Today, exactly a year on, we pay tribute to Brett, Donald and Christopher, who lost their lives, and also, of course, we remember those who were injured.\n\"We come together as Scotland's Railway family and we send our love and support to everyone, particularly the loved ones of the deceased, who have been affected by the tragedy.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  \nGCSE students have received another set of record grades, in the second year of Covid disruption to exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Top grades (7/As and above) rose to 28.9% from 26.2% last year, while grades 4/Cs and above - seen as passes - rose to 77.1% up from 76.3%. Instead of exams, teachers submitted grades for the more than half a million pupils on GCSE courses this year. Exams regulators said the process has been fair and thorough, while some students told us of their relief at getting their grades.\nThe UK economy grew by 4.8% between April and June as most businesses emerged from lockdown. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) was fuelled by retail, restaurants and hotels. Education also boosted the economy as schools reopened in the second quarter. However, the figure was slightly below the 5% the Bank of England expected. The UK economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"The economy and our public finances have experienced a significant shock. It is going to take us time to fully recover from that.\"\nThe UK holiday recovery is lagging behind the rest of Europe, partly due to uncertainty over shifting travel restrictions, Europe's biggest travel firm has said. Tui chief executive Friedrich Joussen said frequent UK rule changes had deterred people. He also said the cost of PCR tests for Covid would also be putting off customers. The UK government has consistently said that travel restrictions are needed to combat the Covid pandemic. Meanwhile a law firm representing travellers is challenging the UK's quarantine hotel policy and seeking a judicial review. Currently, passengers must spend 11 nights in quarantine hotels on returning from red list countries, despite being fully vaccinated and testing negative for Covid. On Thursday, the cost of staying in a quarantine hotel jumped from \u00a31,750 to \u00a32,285. London-based firm PGMBM's managing partner Tom Goodhead called hotel quarantine \"a fundamental breach of human rights\".\nThe Australian capital Canberra is going into a snap one-week lockdown after recording its first case of Covid-19 in more than a year. The lockdown was called for the whole of the Australian Capital Territory - home to around 400,000 people - because authorities do not know how the infected person caught the virus. Residents will only be able to leave home for essential reasons. Queues were reported at supermarkets as the lockdown approached. Australia is struggling to get on top of the highly infectious Delta strain, which has resulted in two of its largest cities - Sydney and Melbourne - going into strict lockdowns. \nGypsies and travellers are arriving at Appleby in Cumbria as the annual horse fair gets under way for the first time since the pandemic. Tens of thousands are expected at the event, which is normally held in June but was postponed this year, and cancelled in 2020, due to Covid. Some businesses in the town have decided to close over fears the fair may prompt a rise in Covid cases. Organisers say pop-up clinics are being made available for those who have not yet been vaccinated. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs the UK's vaccine rollout out continues down the age groups, here's our explainer on which teenagers can now get the vaccine.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "COP26,North Sea oil and gas,Climate change,Oil & Gas industry,Aberdeen",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has written to the prime minister to urge him to reassess the development of a new North Atlantic oil field west of Shetland.\nThe first minister said proposals for the Cambo field should be re-examined over \"the severity of the climate emergency\".\nHer letter comes after a UN report issued a \"code red for humanity\".\nThe UK government wants to reduce the use of fossil fuels, but says there is still \"ongoing demand\" for oil and gas. \nIn her letter, Ms Sturgeon asked Boris Johnson to commit to \"significantly enhancing the climate conditionality\" associated with offshore oil and gas production.\nShe added: \"I am also asking that the UK government agrees to reassess licences already issued but where field development has not yet commenced. That would include the proposed Cambo development.\n\"Such licences, some of them issued many years ago, should be reassessed in light of the severity of the climate emergency we now face, and against a compatibility checkpoint that is fully aligned with our climate change targets and obligations.\"\nThe first minister's intervention is her first on the issue.\nMs Sturgeon also urged the prime minister to host to a four-nations conference ahead of November's COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nEnvironmental groups have accused ministers of \"hypocrisy\" over the summit, after it emerged that the Cambo development could get the green light.\nThe oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of Shetland in water depths of between 1,050m to 1,100m. It contains more than 800 million barrels of oil.  \nWhen asked about Cambo during a visit to Scotland last week, the prime minister told BBC Scotland that contracts should not be \"ripped up\".\nBut Mr Johnson added that \"we need to transition as fast as we reasonably can\" to renewable energy sources.\nThe UK government says the original exploration licence for Cambo dates back to 2001. This licence granted permission to search for oil and gas in the area.\nThere is then a lengthy process - involving field development plans, environmental statements and approval from relevant bodies - before production activity can begin.\nIf approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at Cambo could start as early as 2022. The field is expected to produce oil and gas for approximately 25 years. \nNicola Sturgeon has been sitting on the fence on Cambo and today she edged towards coming off it. \nWhile her reassessment call is not a straightforward \"no\" to the new field, it does lean in that direction.\nIt is hard to imagine how Cambo and projects like it would pass \"robust\" new climate tests, as proposed by the first minister. \nIf that amounts to a \"presumption against\" new oil and gas extraction it would be a major policy shift. \nIt's not so long since the Scottish government endorsed plans to extract maximum remaining value from the North Sea and the SNP has championed the oil industry for decades. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon has stopped short of outright opposition because she knows that jobs, investments and energy security are also at stake. \nGreenpeace UK branded Ms Sturgeon's letter a \"PR exercise\" and called on the first minister to make her \"own stance clear\".\nCampaigner Sam Chetan-Walsh said: \"The first minister must stop hiding behind Boris Johnson. If she wants to show leadership on climate she must clearly say, 'Stop Cambo'.\"\nScottish Labour net-zero spokeswoman Monica Lennon said the first minister had taken \"a baby step\" towards having a position.\nShe added: \"Now is not the time to reassess. It's time for Nicola Sturgeon to firmly and loudly oppose Cambo, once and for all.\"\nScottish Green environment spokesman Mark Ruskell said: \"It is welcome to see the Scottish government start to come off the fence when it comes to the Cambo oil field.\n\"But it is clear there are still far too many hopes pinned on the oil and gas industry to get us out of the climate emergency.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the first minister was putting a \"nationalist alliance with the Greens\" ahead of the economy.\nScottish Conservative Net Zero spokesman Liam Kerr added:  \"The oil and gas sector supports over 100,000 Scottish jobs and the development of the Cambo field could create thousands more. \n\"It's a real shame the SNP government are too busy virtue signalling to work with the industry on the transition to renewables, as the UK government are doing.\"\nIndustry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said the sector was \"committed\" to the Scottish and UK climate targets.\nOGUK energy policy manager, Will Webster, added: \"Regarding Cambo and other future oil and gas investments, it is already demonstrated in projections by government and independent agencies that these are compatible with net zero.\"\nA UK government spokeswoman said it was supporting the oil and gas industry's transition to green energy by 2050.\nShe said: \"Even though demand for fossil fuels is falling and we continue to break records on our use of renewable energy, the advice of the independent Climate Change Committee is that we will continue to need oil and gas in the coming years as it is still vital to the production of many everyday essentials like medicines.\n\"We have already ended support for fossil fuels overseas, and are already designing a climate compatibility checkpoint which will ensure any future licences will only be granted if they are aligned with the UK's climate change objectives.\""

      "tags": "Companies,KFC",
      "text": "KFC has warned that supply chain issues are disrupting both their food and packaging stocks nationwide. \nIn a tweet on Wednesday, the fast-food chain said some items would not be available because there's been \"some disruption\" over the last few weeks.\nThe statement did not mention which items on its menus have been affected or the reason for the disruption. \nIt said the situation is \"not ideal\" and that they were \"working hard to keep things running smoothly\".\n\"Please be patient with our teams...they''re doing a brilliant job despite the disruption,\" it continued. \nThe company did not say which of its restaurants would be affected. The majority (80%) of KFC outlets are run on a franchise basis. \nReplying to the tweet, customers said that there were no cups or lids on drinks. \nIt is not known how long the disruption will last. \nIt comes after a previous supply chain problem in 2018 when the company had to close 750 restaurants after a delivery contract with DHL led to shortages. \nDisruptions across the food and delivery industries are currently being caused by a shortage of HGV drivers, with a combination of fewer drivers from EU member states post Brexit and enforced isolation with drivers being contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nThe Road Haulage Association believes there is a shortfall of about 100,000 lorry drivers across the country. \nDixons Carphone, which owns Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said on Thursday it would pay new lorry drivers a \u00a31,500 bonus amid the shortage. \nExisting drivers will get a \u00a31,500 retention bonus, while those who refer a friend for a driver vacancy will get \u00a31,000. In addition, it will launch a scheme where over 21-year-olds who have held a drivers licence for more than a year will get the costs of training and tests paid for by the company.\nLast month dairy giant Arla, which supplies milk to all major UK supermarkets, said a lorry driver shortage has forced it to cut back on its deliveries. Recently M&S also warned it could be forced to reduce opening hours. \nTesco also said in July it would offer a \u00a31,000 joining bonus for new drivers, and Arla pays \u00a32,000 to drivers willing to work weekends.\nIn July, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours, from nine to 10 hours a day.\nHowever, the RHA said the relaxation was a \"sticking plaster\".\nFrom 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are contacted by NHS Test and Trace when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible."

      "tags": "GCSEs",
      "text": "Teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their GCSE results.\nIn England, these are now graded on a numerical system from 9 to 1, rather than from A to E.\nThe 9-1 grading scheme has been brought in alongside a new GCSE curriculum in England.\nThe highest grade is 9, while 1 is the lowest, not including a U (ungraded).\nThree number grades - 9, 8 and 7 - correspond to the two previous top grades of A* and A.\nExams watchdog Ofqual says fewer grade 9s are awarded than A*s, and that anyone who gets a 9 has \"performed exceptionally\".\nPupils need a 4 for a standard pass and 5 for a \"strong pass\". \nThis means that a candidate who gets nine grade-4s has, technically, passed all their exams.  \nHowever, the government's school league tables are based on the percentage of pupils achieved a 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs.\nWhat's more, many sixth forms will insist on a minimum number of 5s or 6s as a condition of entry. \nLast year there was a spike in the number of pupils who received marks of 4 or above. Ofqual said this year's results would be just as generous, given that Covid has continued to disrupt education.\nThe numerical grading scheme is part of a curriculum introduced in England's schools in 2014 by then Education Secretary Michael Gove.\nGCSE courses now include much less coursework than before, with grades in almost all subjects depending on exams.\nThis has not been the case in 2020 and 2021, when the end-of-year exams were cancelled.\nCourses are designed to be more challenging, with exams taken after two years of study rather than in modules with exams along the way. \nThere are some changes in Northern Ireland too.\nThe NI Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) has introduced a new nine-category grade scale - A* to G, including a C*. \nBut students may also get results with grades 9-1 if they take exams set by English boards.\nThe Welsh government introduced new and revised GCSE courses in September 2015.\nThe most significant changes were in English language, Welsh language and mathematics. \nThey are different from the English exam in that they have retained the letter-based grading structure  A*- G.\nScotland has its own system of public examinations - Nationals and Highers. \nNationals replaced the old Standard Grades in 2014, and new Higher exams were introduced in 2015.

The exams were cancelled for a second year because of the pandemic. And like the A-levels and Scotland's Highers and Nationals, grades are based on mini-exams, mock exams, homework or coursework. There are predictions, similar to with the A-level results released on Tuesday, that there will be a spike in grades. Teacher-assessed grades are likely to be higher on average, a year after there were record rises for GCSEs. \nUK economic growth rose by 4.8% between April and June, according to official figures, as the coronavirus lockdown eased. The growth, fuelled by the relaxing of restrictions, was strongest in sectors hard-hit under lockdowns, such as wholesale and retail, hotels and restaurants. Despite the growth, it fell slightly below the Bank of England's 5% prediction.

According to Jacinda Ardern, it's the best way to keep Covid-19 out and the economy open. With a population of just under five million New Zealand - seen as one of the most successful countries to control the virus - has only recorded 26 deaths. It's aiming to vaccinate everyone by the end of the year with hopes to reopen borders in 2022.\nIt's an \"unlawful deprivation of liberty\", says a law firm which is seeking a judicial review of the UK's quarantine hotel policy. London-based firm PGMBM is representing travellers, who when returning from red list countries must spend 11 nights in quarantine hotels regardless of vaccinated status or testing negative for Covid.

The group's rapid advance has dealt a crushing blow to government security forces.\nSources have told the BBC that Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, is also now in the hands of the Taliban, though this has not been confirmed. \nThousands of civilians have been displaced, fleeing to Kabul to try and escape the fighting.\nTaking Ghazni is a significant gain due to its location - it is 150km (93 miles) from Kabul, and is on the major Kabul-Kandahar motorway, linking militant strongholds in the south to Kabul.\nA provincial council member in the city told the BBC that the Taliban had taken most of the centre, with only a police base on the outskirts controlled by the Afghan security forces.\nHerat, which has been under siege for weeks, is also a major win for the militants. It is Afghanistan's third largest city, lies on significant ancient trade routes and is seen as the gateway to Iran. \nOn Thursday, video on social media showed the insurgents running through a central Herat street firing their weapons, and the Taliban flag was seen flying over the police headquarters. A regional council member confirmed to the BBC that the city had fallen to the militants. \nMeanwhile in Kandahar, once the Taliban's stronghold, heavy fighting was reported and the militants claimed to have taken over its prison and released all of the inmates, although this has not been confirmed. \nIf Kandahar falls into militant hands, it will be the biggest loss yet for Afghan security forces.\n\"Life as we know it is getting harder day by day,\" a woman in Kandahar told the BBC, adding \"both sides are just using\u2026 us as pawns in their own power-hungry games\".\nThe US embassy in Kabul said it was hearing reports that the Taliban was executing Afghan troops who were surrendering, saying it was \"deeply disturbing and could constitute war crimes.\"\nThe US said it was sending 3,000 troops to the airport in Kabul to help evacuate a \"significant\" amount of embassy staff on special flights.\nThe UK later said it was deploying about 600 troops on a short-term basis to provide support to British nationals leaving the country. The number of staff working at the British embassy in Kabul has abeen reduced to a core team. \nMore than 1,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the past month, according to the UN.\nJust this week thousands of people from northern provinces have become internally displaced, travelling to Kabul to seek safety. An estimated 72,000 children arrived in the capital in recent days and are mostly sleeping on the streets, according to Save the Children.\nMakeshift camps have been established on scrubland on the outskirts of the capital, while many others have reportedly been sleeping on the streets or in abandoned warehouses.\n\"We have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child,\" a 35-year-old street vendor who fled Kunduz province after the Taliban set fire to his home told the BBC. \nIn response to the insurgency, the German government has threatened to end its annual financial support of $500m (\u00a3360m) to Afghanistan if the Taliban gains complete control of the country.\nGermany has also suspended the forced repatriation of Afghan citizens whose asylum applications have failed. The French and Danish governments said they would follow the same policy.\nOn Wednesday, Afghanistan replaced its army chief, General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, who had only been in the post since June. \nAlso on Wednesday, President Ashraf Ghani flew to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif - traditionally an anti-Taliban bastion - to try to rally pro-government forces there.\nMazar-i-Sharif lies close to the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and its loss would mark the complete collapse of government control over northern Afghanistan.\nPresident Ghani held crisis talks in Mazar-i-Sharif with ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and prominent ethnic Tajik leader Atta Mohammad Noor about defending the city.\nMr Dostum, a veteran commander, was quoted as saying: \"The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped.\"\nFor years, Mr Ghani tried to sideline the warlords in an attempt to boost the Afghan National Army, and now he is turning to them in his hour of need, the BBC's Ethirajan Anbarasan says. Earlier this week, the president also agreed to arm pro-government militia.\nAre you in Afghanistan? Do you have links to Ghazni?

      "text": "For students across the UK, this has been another year of uncertainty and disruption.\nFor the second year running, exams were cancelled, with final grades based on assessments by teachers.\nThose receiving results this week have had both of their past two years of study interrupted by the pandemic. \nMolly, aged 18, from Liverpool says she's feeling particularly anxious about her A-level results on Tuesday. \n All the disruption means that she doesn't \"feel in control of my own level of achievement\".\n\"I feel like it's been a rollercoaster,\" she says. \n\"There have been times when I feel like it's better it happened this way, and there have been other times when I think, if I could, I would redo the whole two years. The anxiety comes in waves.\"\nMolly worries how fair the system of teacher-assessed grades has been on students. \n\"Everybody has had a different experience and everyone has done a different type of assessment and I just don't think, when we get the grades, that it will be a true reflection of how well we could have done.\"\nShe is hoping for an A* and two As on Tuesday, and originally applied to do a psychology degree. But the experience of studying in a pandemic led her to defer to do a high-level diploma in dance at the Northern Ballet School.\nShe is also concerned her qualifications may be less valued in the future. \n\"I feel employers might look at our grades and say that was the year Covid happened and you didn't sit proper exams.\"\nFatima from south London is feeling quite optimistic about achieving her target of three A grades in her A-level exams - in English literature, geography and psychology. \nBut she's not always felt that way. She's had ups and downs throughout the year and her views have fluctuated. She had to go into isolation twice and missed four weeks of school.\nShe says: \"After the second lockdown, I was unsure if I could pass exams but I really just wanted to sit them. When I found out I couldn't do exams, I was really upset.\"\nFatima believes teachers will grade her fairly but worried when exams were cancelled. \n\"I didn't want a repeat of last year, especially because I live in a low-income neighbourhood. Are they going to assume I'm going to get bad grades because of the area I live in? I don't trust the government to decide that for me.\"\nLike Molly, Fatima decided not to go to university - she's doing a two-year public policy apprenticeship at Ofcom.\nShe found her involvement with youth charity The Mix a great help during lockdown. It allowed her to hook up with other young people remotely, to watch and discuss films. \n\"Especially because I'm quite extroverted, being in my house all day is literally the worst thing you could do to me,\" she says.\nHolly Turner from the Mix says the number of conversations around school and education has almost tripled on their helpline year-on-year.\n\"We've seen just how difficult it has been for students since the start of the pandemic. They have experienced severe disruption to their education, and the constant change and uncertainty is having a serious impact on their mental health.\" \nZoya, aged 16, from Lancashire, says she is feeling really nervous about getting her GCSE results, which are out two days after A-levels. \n\"Normally, Year 11 would feel stress at the end of the year but we had stress from the beginning because we'd missed so much.\n\"Last year, in Year 10, they didn't teach us anything new. We were just catching up while studying for our mocks so it was very hectic. So many isolated so much, they were off for most of the school year.\"\nThe experience has not put her off studying. She's aiming to do A-levels next year in psychology, English literature, English language. performing arts and fine arts.\nDavid, 17, will get his results in the three BTec subjects he took in computing, media and criminology. \nBTecs are based more on coursework than exams, and David says he \"found it tough to get into the mindset of working from home,\" especially not seeing his friends from college.\n\"It really affected my mental health at one stage, which took a toll not only on me personally but also my work, because I was finding it hard to have the motivation.\"\nThe lack of resources at home created problems for his coursework. He struggled, for example, to do the work needed for his media course, as he didn't have access to the cameras and lighting equipment available in the college.\nDespite finding the process tiring, David saw it through and has a conditional offer from the University of Hull to study social work, although he is keeping his options open.\nWhat questions do you have about this year's results?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Women can now wear trousers at the Henley Royal Regatta everywhere after it changed its \"draconian\" dress code. \nPreviously women could only wear a dress or skirt with a hemline below the knee to gain access to the Steward's Enclosure at the annual event in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. \nFor the first time in decades women can now wear trousers and trouser suits.\nRegatta chairman Sir Steve Redgrave said organisers believed women should wear trousers if they wished to.\nThe five-time Olympic champion said the dress code at the Steward's Enclosure was only adopted in the late 1970s.\n\"We felt with the introduction of all the new events for females, if they would like to wear trousers, they should be allowed to wear trousers,\" said Sir Steve.\n\"Within investitures they now allow trousers as well, so we've eased our dress code for that same sort of reason.\"\nIt comes after a petition last year by University of Oxford rower Georgia Grant who called the dress code \"draconian\".\nMs Grant said: \"It's quite a small change, but I think for them to sort of concede on it and change something which has existed for years, that's a huge step and it made me feel quite excited about attending the event.\"\nShe added her petition had led to transgender and disabled attendees sharing their struggles over their difficulty choosing what to wear, and that the next step should be \"de-gendering\" the dress requirements. \nThe Steward's Enclosure is only open to stewards who organise the regatta, members - who can reportedly wait years to be given membership - and their guests. \nIt is described by one rowing website as the \"equivalent of the Royal Enclosure at Ascot\", and has the best view of the finish line. \nMen are required to wear lounge suits, or jackets, or blazers with trousers, together with a tie or a cravat. \nIzzie Mayhew-Smith, who was wearing trousers to the Steward's Enclosure, said: \"It was a lot easier to find something to wear in my wardrobe, and I think it's good because men can wear trousers so we should be able to as well.\n\"The regatta becoming more modernised will maybe encourage more people to come and it's not just something for older people that's old fashioned.\"\nLucy O'Neill added: \"Trousers are just more comfortable personally and it's easier to walk around and sit down, so I've enjoyed wearing my trousers today.\"\nIn previous years women could only wear trousers in the Regatta Enclosure - which did not have a formal dress code.\nA trouser ban remains for women at some private member clubs alongside the river where spectators can view the regatta.\nThe annual five-day event, which is taking place from 11-15 August, has resumed after it was cancelled last year for the first time in its history outside of the World Wars due to Covid-19. \nHenley Royal Regatta sees rowers battle it out on the River Thames over five days of racing, attracting huge crowds.\nIt was first staged in 1839 and attracts participants ranging from Olympians, university and school teams, to amateur clubs.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "With violence surging in Afghanistan, and the Taliban taking new territories in the north, thousands of people are fleeing their homes to seek safety in the capital Kabul.\nWhen they get there, many of these people face sleeping in abandoned warehouses or on the streets. They're struggling to find food, shelter and other basic necessities, such as medicine and sanitary items.\nBut they feel they have little choice - it is either hardship in Kabul, or potential death in their home region.\nNow, thousands have gathered in makeshift camps on scrubland on the city's outskirts.\nAsadullah, a 35-year-old street vendor from Kunduz province, travelled to the capital with his wife and two young daughters earlier this week after the Taliban set fire to his home.\n\"I was a street worker, I sold food and spices... but when the Taliban attacked we came to Kabul,\" he tells the BBC. \n\"Now we have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child.\"\nAsadullah and his young family spent the night on the streets.\n\"All of our home and belongings caught fire, so we came to Kabul and pray to God to help us. Rockets and mortars hit our home... there were heavy clashes in the past seven days, we had no bread to eat and all the bakeries, shops and bazaars were closed.\"\nA woman, who didn't give her name, told the BBC she fled her home in the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri with her husband and children. Her husband, she says, was wounded in the war.\n\"We had a good life, but because of the bomb blasts we lost our home and came here,\" she says. \"We left our home with only one dress and no money.\"\nHumanitarian organisations have been warning of a rise in internally displaced persons in Afghanistan since US-led forces began withdrawing from the country earlier this year, following 20 years of military operations.\nThe campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil. Now, most of the foreign troops have pulled out.\nSince then, clashes between the Taliban and government forces have escalated. The Taliban have taken at least eight of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening to seize more. \nThe Washington Post has also cited unnamed US officials saying that even Kabul could fall to the Taliban within the next 90 days, based on US military assessments.\nThis unrest has caused a rise in people fleeing their homes for the capital. In July the UN warned that around 270,000 more people were internally displaced in the country after troops started to leave - this number is estimated to have surged in just the last few days.\nAmid all of this more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, according to the UN.\nNGOs say that this mass displacement will hit women and children particularly hard. \n\"We're seeing a lot of increased reporting around health protection needs, gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and trafficking,\" Jared Rowell, Country Director of the Danish Refugee Council in Afghanistan, tells the BBC.\n\"Early marriage will become a larger problem too as girls and young women are sold off in order to get cash to provide for their families. Those types of issues, which have always been a problem, are going to get more and more severe.\"\nAs well as food, shelter and health and sanitary items, Mr Rowell says, displaced people in Kabul are in desperate need of cash. \n\"It's really important people have access to multi-purpose cash,\" he says. \"Meaning an agency like DRC would give them a cash distribution that they have the autonomy to determine what they spend that money on in order to best support their needs. \n\"Cash is also particularly important at this point in time, especially when they're relocating to a large city like Kabul with high food prices and markets with fluctuating prices due to the current instability.\"\nFor Asadullah, his main hope now is that his family can one day return to their normal life in Kunduz.\n\"We want to go back and continue our lives there,\" he says. \"We hope that one day peace will come to Afghanistan, and our country will be free.\""

      "text": "A law firm representing travellers is challenging the UK's quarantine hotel policy and seeking a judicial review.\nCurrently, passengers must spend 11 nights in quarantine hotels on returning from red list countries, despite being fully vaccinated and testing negative for Covid.\nLondon-based firm PGMBM says this is an \"unlawful deprivation of liberty\".\nOn Thursday, the cost of staying in a quarantine hotel jumped from \u00a31,750 to \u00a32,285.\nThe firm has begun legal proceedings. \nPGMBM managing partner Tom Goodhead said: \"Mandatory hotel quarantine is a fundamental breach of human rights. It has led to the false imprisonment of people who are fully vaccinated and have tested negative.\n\"Prisoners are entitled to more liberty than those forced to quarantine in hotels.\"\nMore than 60 locations including Turkey, Mexico, Kenya and many countries in Africa are currently on the red list. \nThe other European countries with mandatory quarantine involving hotel detentions - Ireland and Norway - have amended their schemes so fully vaccinated travellers are exempt from needing to quarantine.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are determined to protect our country and the progress we have made thanks to the vaccine rollout. That is why the government has taken decisive action at the border, including the introduction of the managed quarantine system. \n\"Every essential check we've introduced has strengthened our defences against the risk of new coronavirus variants.\n\"Countries around the world are taking equivalent action and apply a fixed charge for quarantine costs. The cost for travelling back from a red list country covers transport from the port of arrival to the designated hotel, food, accommodation, security, other essential services and testing.\"\nThe legal team are seeking compensation, not only for those they represent, but also for anyone who has been double-jabbed in the UK and has stayed at a quarantine hotel. \nIn addition to compensation for the alleged breach in human rights, the law firm is also seeking refunds of the cost of the quarantine hotel stays.\nThis is the second case PGMBM has brought about quarantine hotels. The first was on the grounds of financial hardship and resulted in the government offering the option to pay in 12 monthly instalments for those facing financial hardship.\n\"We want to see this draconian policy scrapped and those affected to be properly compensated,\" he continued. \nMr Goodhead added that the majority of the people who got in touch with the law firm were not travelling to or from red list countries for holidays or for leisure.\n\"They are often travelling for emergency or urgent reasons and would not be travelling unless they felt it was absolutely necessary,\" he explained.

      "text": "GCSE passes for England's pupils, in the most disrupted academic year in UK history, have risen dramatically.\nGrades have been awarded by schools, after exams were cancelled, and data shows 78.8% of papers were rated grade 4 or above. It was 69.9% in 2019.\nThere was a rise of a quarter in the top grades - a 7 or above, which is equivalent to an A in the old system.\nThe exams season has been dogged by chaos, with policy changes leading to grades being altered at the 11th hour.\nIn the latest debacle BTec grades were pulled hours before pupils were to receive them although some schools are giving out grades, which were assessed by schools, anyway.\nAnd universities are still waiting for pupils' adjusted A-level results, while they attempt to squeeze as many as possible into the courses they have qualified for. \nUniversities and the government have now agreed to honour all degree places - this year or next - to students who have obtained the right grades, but there are concerns about the funding of these.\nEngland's exams watchdog, Ofqual, says this year's results cannot be compared to last year's and has confirmed that students who are unhappy with GCSE grades awarded by their school or college will not be able to appeal - other than for an administrative error.\nThe watchdog's efforts to maintain standards through a, now discredited, algorithm led to problems for the awarding of A-levels last week and stress for students.  \nIn Wales, where grades are alphabetical,  26% of results were at grade A*or A  - up by eight percentage points from just over 18% in 2019.\nAlmost all pupils - 99.6% - received passes at A*-G grades, compared to 97.2% last year.\nIn Northern Ireland, 37.1% of pupils achieving grade A* to A - up by 5.7 percentage points on last year.\nThe numbers receiving A*-G grades increased by 0.9 percentage points to 99.7%.\nAt Bolton's Canon Slade School, Sophie, 16, said she was \"super happy\" with a string of top grades which will allow her to start her A-level course in a few weeks time. \nHer sister Hannah received her BTec results last week and is \"over the moon\" with her distinction scores.   \nAt Bexleyheath Academy in London, parent Heather Dockerill said the results system could have been managed better: \"These kids have been through hell.\"\nBut her daughter Jess said that, in the end, she was relieved to have got the grades she needed for sixth form.  \nEvie, 15, agrees it's been a challenging year, but but she's \"over the moon\" with the results.\n\"My hard work has paid off so there's a sense of relief.\"\nCory, 16, who did both GCSEs and BTecs said he was proud of his grades.\n\"2020 has been unfortunate, but I feel like I've made the best of the situation and I've stayed happy for the whole year.\"\nHarriet, 16, relieved when her GCSE grades came through: \"I honestly don't think I could have been happier with the results.\"\n\"The U-turn was for the best.\" \nGraeme Napier, principal of Bexleyheath Academy, said it was great to see happy students.\n\"It's reassuring that the awarding bodies have agreed to look at the results again - the important thing is that students get the results they deserve.\"\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said young people should feel \"incredibly proud of all they've achieved in the face of immense challenge and uncertainty\".\n\"I also want to pay a special tribute to teachers and school leaders this year who have shown dedication, resilience and ingenuity to support their students to get to this moment.\"\nGeoff Barton, head of the head teachers' union ASCL, said students and teachers should be congratulated.\n\"These have been extraordinarily difficult circumstances, and this generation of young people has suffered a degree of uncertainty and disruption that is without precedent.\"\nChief executive of Association of Colleges, David Hughes said: \"With an increase in top grades and passes, it is likely that more students than ever will progress to Level 3 vocational courses or A-levels. \n\"There is no need to panic for anyone unsure what to do, or for those awaiting grades - colleges will be able to meet their needs and there will be space for everyone.\"\nOn BTecs, exam board Pearson said it needed to look again at grades following the education secretaries' reversion to centre-assessed grades, which pushed results higher.\nHowever, the late decision is causing even further disruption to students seeking places in further and higher education.\nHeads' leader Mr Barton he could not understand why it had taken Pearson until so late to realise the implications of grade changes for its BTec qualifications.\n\"It really does need to give an explanation of why this has happened. We feel desperately sorry for the students affected in a year when they have already undergone far too much disruption.\"\nPearson said in a statement: \"BTec qualification results have been been generally consistent with teacher and learner expectations, but we have become concerned about unfairness in relation to what are now significantly higher outcomes for GCSE and A-levels.\"\nBut Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the delay to BTec results was absolutely disgraceful. \nShe said demanded to know what had been going on since it became apparent that there was a problem with exam results, adding that the government was warned the algorithm might treat people unfairly.\nThe grades you leave school with,  shape the next few years of your life, they're the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. \nThe system is regulated with one overarching aim - to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people.  \nSo grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next.  \nOver the last three weeks across the UK that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. \nThe price of putting that right, to avoid penalising a generation, is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. \nThe cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable.  The inquest is far from over.  \nIt's clear this can never be allowed to happen like this again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that don't have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed. \nAre you waiting for your BTec results?

      "text": "Directors at UK inhaler company Vectura have recommended shareholders accept a \u00a31bn bid from tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PMI).\nThe Marlboro cigarette maker's offer of \u00a31.65 per share beat a rival bid from US private equity group Carlyle, whose final offer was \u00a31.55 per share. \nVectura makes inhaled medicines and devices to treat respiratory illnesses such as asthma.\nDozens of health groups had urged Vectura to reject the firm's offer.\nThe health groups warned that the deal would significantly harm the future prospects of the healthcare company, as it will deter top lung researchers and scientists unwilling to work for a tobacco company. \nShares in Vectura, which counts Novartis and GSK among its customers, have soared 33% in value since Carlyle's first offer in May.\nPhilip Morris recently said it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK in 10 years' time as it focuses on alternatives, such as heated tobacco.\nThe firm indicated it would welcome a government ban on cigarettes and said \"strong regulation\" was needed to \"help solve the problem of cigarette smoking once and for all\".\nHowever, health charity Ash said it was hard to take such claims seriously from the firm responsible for selling over a tenth of cigarettes globally.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"Philip Morris's attempted takeover of a key player in lung health products beggars belief. It is bitterly disappointing that Vectura have so far failed to exercise duty of care to patients and scientists and reject this takeover by big tobacco. \n\"This is now a test for Sajid Javid. When we know smoking causes so much serious illness and premature death, it's time this government takes the right course, stands up to this tobacco giant and blocks this takeover.\"\nSources close to the deal tell me the company feels their primary duty is to shareholders and note that PMI must be allowed a chance to transition to its stated goal of deriving half its revenue from non tobacco products within a decade.\nSome have also questioned whether this deal is any different in principle from oil and gas companies investing in renewable energy. \nHowever, this decision will be treated with dismay by health groups and will disappoint many shareholder groups who hoped this deal be an acid test of whether shareholders really prized wider societal goals over getting the best price. \nPMI will need to convince 51% of shareholders to take the money for it to take control. Many other shareholders may feel uncomfortable being a minority shareholder in a tobacco company subsidiary. \nA letter sent by more than 20 UK, US and European health organisations on Thursday had urged Vectura's board to \"put sustainability and ethics first\".\nThe signatories included the bosses of Asthma UK, the British Lung Foundation, the Royal Society for Public Health and the Royal College of Physicians, as well as public health directors of several councils and some distinguished medical professors from King's College, Imperial College and University College London (UCL).\n\"If PMI were to acquire Vectura, PMI could then profit from treating the very illnesses that its products cause,\" they wrote.\nOne of the health groups' key concerns is that Vectura's research links with various universities and hospitals could be compromised. \nThe signatories warned that Vectura could be blocked from participating in clinical trials, thus \"disrupting crucial drug development\".\nThey added that professional partnerships could also be affected, since Vectura won the most contracts in 2020 to develop treatments for respiratory disease and lung cancer.\nThe takeover battle began in May with a \u00a3958m bid from Carlyle, which received early backing from Vectura's board.\nBut on 8 August, Philip Morris increased its offer to \u00a31.65 per share, which totalled a bid of about \u00a31.02bn ($1.41bn) from the Marlboro cigarette-maker.\nLondon-listed shares of Vectura closed at \u00a31.63 on Thursday after hitting a more than five-year high of \u00a31.76 pence on Tuesday.

      "tags": "A&E,Queen Elizabeth University Hospital,NHS Scotland,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's hospitals are under more pressure than ever, doctors have told BBC Scotland. \nWhile the number of Covid patients has fallen, the NHS is trying to catch up with surgeries and treatments put on hold during the first wave of the pandemic. \nBut more people are also being admitted with other complex, more advanced disease, having put off seeking treatment.  \nIt's leading to long waits in emergency departments and piling pressure on capacity in other parts of the hospital. \nAs the Scottish government prepares to publish a Covid recovery plan for the NHS, medics at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital spoke to BBC Scotland's health correspondent Lisa Summers.\nIt's 10am on Tuesday at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.  The emergency department is full. Five seriously ill patients are in resus, all 16 assessment cubicles are occupied. Some have been waiting more than 12 hours for a bed to become available elsewhere in the hospital.  \nDr Alan Whitelaw, a consultant in emergency medicine who heads up the department, says: \"The demand is something I have never seen before, it is busier than the Queen Elizabeth has ever been in its six years of existence.\"\nIt is a similar picture in other emergency departments. Data published this week by Public Health Scotland shows nationally just 78.7% of patients were admitted, treated or discharged within four hours, and 182 people spent more than 12 hours in an A&E. \nDr Whitelaw says the pressures in the emergency department are a reflection of how stretched the NHS is, with very few beds available in other parts of the hospital.\n\"Lying on a trolley for a number of hours anywhere is unpleasant, it also turns the tension up, everyone is waiting and everyone is not as satisfied as they otherwise would be,\" he says.  \n\"It's a very difficult place to come and work just now. It's very tiring, very draining, stressful and you can see that on the staff on a day-by-day basis.\"\nOther parts of the hospital are equally busy. Staff are still treating Covid patients but in far fewer numbers. Instead, they are seeing many more patients who have more complex and advanced disease.\nHelen Dorrance, a senior surgeon who specialises in cancer, has more than 20 years' experience but says the last 18 months have been the most difficult of her career.\n\"The waiting times for clinics and for investigations like colonoscopy and endoscopy and for day surgery in particular are huge at the moment, so I have no idea when we are going to be out of this other than it is not going to be any time quickly,\" she says.\nIt is very hard knowing that delays in starting treatment have led to worse outcomes for some patients, she adds. \n\"It makes you very sad for the individual, sometimes angry. It's very difficult knowing that had an individual come six months earlier then the discussions might have been different, the outcome for them and for their families might have been completely different.\" \nAt the start of the pandemic, it was care-of-the-elderly wards which were the first to be turned into Covid wards. \nSenior charge nurse Lauren Johnson says staff had to adapt quickly to wearing PPE and communicating with sometimes confused or hard-of-hearing patients who were scared and couldn't see their families. \n\"It's a blur, it really is,\" she says. \"The five months I worked on the Covid hub was so difficult, I didn't see my family. \n\"I get emotional just talking about it, just seeing our wee frail patients not getting the chance for their families to say goodbye sometimes, and we were the ones saying goodbye to them, it was really, really difficult. \n\"It was the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with in my life.\"\nThere are 244 care-of-the-elderly beds at the Queen Elizabeth, most of them are back to treating non-Covid patients, but all of them are occupied.  \nClinical lead and consultant in medicine for the elderly, Dr Lara Mitchell, says the patients who come to them are also sicker. \n\"We are still full, we are still busy,\" she says. \"The pandemic has been hard for all of us but it has been particularly bad for the older adult. \n\"They've not been connected with as many of their family and friends, they've not had ways to meet, so patients are not as strong as they used to be. \n\"All of that impacts on their general health when they have other medical issues going on, and I think that is what we are seeing, a lot of deconditioning as well as late presentation of illness because people have held on at home.\"\nA spokesperson for the Scottish government said they recognised the additional pressure NHS staff were facing, and were in daily contact with boards facing the greatest challenges. \n\"We are delivering record funding of more than \u00a316bn in 2021-22 to support NHS Scotland and its heroic staff through the most challenging period in history - and after careful and extensive consultation we are currently finalising our NHS recovery plan which will set out plans to increase inpatient, day-case and outpatient activity,\" they added. \nGetting the health service back on track is going to be a huge challenge.  Spending on healthcare already amounts to about half of the entire Scottish budget, and there have been long-standing difficulties recruiting staff.\nOutside the emergency department, four ambulances are parked up.  They are waiting with patients onboard until there is room in the department.  It means four less ambulances on the road.  \nSocial distancing rules limit numbers in the waiting room and a queue has formed outside.  A nurse is patiently explaining the pressures today and helping patients work out if they would get better treatment elsewhere.\nDr Whitelaw says: \"If you've got what you perceive to be a life-threatening condition you should absolutely come to the emergency department, whether that is by 999 ambulance or getting here yourself.  \n\"I think if you've not got what you think is a life-threatening condition you should access NHS 24 on 111 rather than just coming to an emergency department, because demand currently exceeds supply and we are full today.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Computer hacking,Cryptocurrency,Cyber-security",
      "text": "The hacker behind one of the largest cryptocurrency heists to date has returned almost half of the $600m (\u00a3433m) stolen assets.\nOn Tuesday, the firm affected, Poly Network wrote a letter on Twitter, asking the individual to get in touch \"to work out a solution\". \nThe hacker then posted messages pledging to return funds, claiming to be \"not very interested in money\".\nOn Wednesday, Poly Network said it had received $260m back.\nThe company, a blockchain platform which lets users swap different types of digital tokens, posted on Twitter that it had been sent back three cryptocurrencies, including $3.3m worth of Ethereum, $256m worth of Binance Coin and $1m worth of Polygon.\nA total of $269m in Ether tokens and $84m in Polygon tokens has yet to be recovered.  \nA blockchain is a ledger, or log, of every single transaction made of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. \nThe ledger is distributed to all the users in the network to verify all new transactions when they occur, instead of being held by any one single authority.\nThe hacker published a three-page-long Q&A session on one of the blockchains essentially in the form of a self-interview, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a London-based blockchain analytics and compliance firm.\nThe hacker claimed to have always planned to return the tokens and said the heist was carried out to highlight vulnerabilities in Poly Network software.\n\"I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn't they learn something from those hacks?\" the hacker wrote in the notes embedded on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe hacker claimed to have spent all night looking for a vulnerability to exploit. They said they were worried that Poly Network would patch the security flaw quietly without telling anyone, so they decided to take millions of dollars in cryptocurrency tokens to make a point. \nBut they stressed that they did not want to cause a \"real panic [in] the crypto-world\", so they only took \"important coins\", leaving behind Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started off as a joke. \n\"Either they just intended to commit theft and steal the assets, or they were acting like a white hat hacker to expose a bug, to help Poly Network make themselves more strong and secure,\" Mr Robinson, who routinely advises governments and law enforcement agencies about crypto-related crimes, told the BBC.\nHe added that the nature of blockchain technology makes it hard for cyber-criminals to profit from stealing digital currencies, because everyone can see the money being moved across the network into the hackers' wallets.\n\"I wonder whether this hacker stole the funds, realised how much publicity and attention they were getting, realised wherever they moved the funds they would be watched, and decided to give it back,\" said Mr Robinson.\n\"The blockchain itself has operated here flawlessly, but the problem is on blockchains like Ethereum, you can write your own smart contracts. Various services have started offering this, including Poly Network. \n\"So whenever a human being writes code, there's a chance they will make a mistake.\"\nPoly Network's platform works by facilitating movement between several blockchains when people trade one cryptocurrency for another, such as trading Binance Coin for Ether.\n\"The Poly Network is the thing that facilitates the movement between these chains - ultimately, it's software, it's code, and code always has imperfections and defects in it,\" James Chappell, co-founder of London-based cyber-security firm Digital Shadows, told the BBC.\n\"And that's true of banks, or any financial system. Unfortunately, what seems to have happened here is a party has spotted a weakness in the implementation and exploited it to fool the network into transferring these tokens incorrectly.\"\nSimilar attacks have happened to several other services in the last 12 months. These include: \nAfter a rollercoaster 24 hours for the crypto community, it seems the hacker intends to return all or most of the stolen money.  \nAs the criminal posted online: \"The pain suffered is temporary, but memorable.\"\nThe claim that it was all an elaborate way to force Poly Network to fix security failings is being treated with scepticism.\nWhy the taunting and boasting online if the motive was honourable? \nThere's some suggestion that the net may have been closing in, as one cyber-security company says it was close to working out the identity of a suspect. \nIt might have been the case that the hacker bit off way more than they could chew and got scared, so returned the money.\nRegardless, the authorities will still no doubt be working hard to find them.\nBut what this story mostly points to is just how powerful hackers can be and how powerless the unregulated, decentralised cryptocurrency world is when someone swipes a large fortune from under its nose."

      "text": "Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their GCSE results.\nTeachers were asked to award grades after exams were cancelled for the second year in a row, because of the pandemic.\nThe number of pupils receiving the top grades - A or 7 and above - has increased again this year. But the 2.7% rise since 2020 is smaller than the 9% rise between 2019 and 2020.\nIndividual schools decided how teachers came up with final grades. They could base their decisions on a number of different aspects, including:\nPupils were told which pieces of work counted towards their grades.\nThey already knew the results of most of the individual pieces of work, but teachers should not have told them their final grade before today. In Wales, students were given their provisional grade in June, ahead of official results day.\nExam boards have been checking the schools' marking methods to make sure they follow official guidance.\nThey may also have asked schools for a sample of their results to check that grades are not significantly out of line with previous years.\nIf you are disappointed with your result, you can opt to re-take that subject in the autumn.\nThis would involve sitting formal exams. You should speak to your school about deadlines and how to proceed.\nIf you do decide to sit an exam in the autumn and you receive a higher mark than your teacher-assessed grade, it will count as your final result.\nAlternatively, If you think you have been given an unfair grade, you can appeal. Grades can go up or down if they are changed after an appeal.\nThe first step is to ask your school or college to review the grade as soon as possible.\nIf you are still unsatisfied with the school's decision, you can appeal to the exam board.\nThe deadline for this is 17 September. \nStudents who have taken BTec First are also receiving their results on Thursday.\nBTecs are qualifications based on work-based skills. They can be taken in areas such as business, healthcare and engineering.\nUnlike GCSEs and A-levels, BTecs are formally assessed throughout the academic year, meaning that there is more information on which to base final grades. \nAS, A-level and BTEC National results came out on Tuesday.\nStudents in Scotland sit different exams. Official results were released on 10 August, confirming provisional grades awarded in June.\nWhen Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that exams would be cancelled again this year, there was a mixed reaction.\nThe National Association of Head Teachers said the plans would avoid \"the awful chaos of last year\".\nThe Sutton Trust - an education charity - has expressed concern that teacher-assessed grades could lead to students from wealthier backgrounds getting higher marks than they would usually. \nIts research - focusing on A-Level students - found that parents at less deprived schools were more likely to approach or pressure teachers about their children's grades.\nThe GCSE is the qualification taken by 15 and 16-year-olds to graduate from the Key Stage 4 phase of secondary education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe grading system in England  was changed from letters to numbers in 2018. The old A* was replaced by grades 9 and 8, with 7 replacing A.\nThe updated grades were part of a new curriculum introduced in England's schools in 2014 by the then education secretary, Michael Gove, putting far more emphasis on exams rather than coursework.\nWales kept its letter-based grading structure, while Northern Ireland opted for a mixture of letters and numbers for its grades.\nGCSEs were due to be decided by a mathematical model, known as an algorithm, but this plan was abandoned.\nAfter a last-minute change by the government, pupils' GCSE grades were based on teachers' assessments. \nThe U-turn came after uproar when about 40% of A-level results were downgraded by exam regulator Ofqual.\nOfqual chair Roger Taylor told the BBC the regulator decided to \"change course\" after seeing the \"anxiety\" it had caused to young people.\nMinisters are planning for exams to return next year for GCSEs, A-levels and vocational exams in England.\nBut, unlike in the past, pupils are likely to get told which topics will come up, to ensure no one is disadvantaged if they have been affected by Covid disruption.\nThere are similar plans in Wales and Northern Ireland, with exams modified to take into account the turmoil of the past two years."

Ministers who once fulminated against such rising grades have looked the other way.\nBut there will be consequences for those chasing university places - with warnings of a crush for top places in a year when more people than ever have applied.\nThe sorting process for the most sought-after universities is usually based on the limited number getting top grades. \nBut over the last two years the proportion of top grades has soared from about 25% to about 45%. In independent schools, it's over 70%, compared with 39% in comprehensives.\nThe Russell Group of top universities has already said that those who narrowly missed out on required grades will find it harder to get a place - because so many will already have been filled.\nOnce today's celebrations have finished, there will nervous glances ahead to next year. Because having allowed results to rise like a kite, at what point and how do you pull them down again?\nWill there be a long-term plan to get grades back to pre-pandemic levels? And would that mean years of artificially lowered grades? How would that be fair?\nNone of that will be of much concern to those getting their results today. Whether celebrating or commiserating, or a bit of both, this has been the strangest of times to be in an exam year.\nWhat's it really about? Maybe put the percentages aside.\nEven when writing this in the office, there was a parent disappearing into a corner with their mobile phone.

I got all 9s in my GCSEs and two distinctions,\" she said. \n\"It's the best possible results and I'm so proud of myself. I think there is a big sense of relief.\" \nHer mum, Shahima came to the school with her to share the experience.\nShe says: \"I'm extremely, extremely proud of Syeda. She's put so much effort and hard work into this and lots of sleepless nights.\"\n\"It has been a bit crazy for everyone involved in this process this year,\" she says.\nRoman is celebrating four grade 7s and four grade 8s in his GCSEs. \n\"I'm definitely satisfied, but in a sense I feel I've been bumped down a few grades due to some exams being very different and out of the ordinary this year compared to other years.\" \nHe says the challenges he's faced over the past two years have had an impact.\n\"It's been a rollercoaster. So many ups and downs and so many battles, both mental battles and physical ones.\"\nHe says he would actually have preferred to sit exams as he feels one exam at the end would have been easier than the constant pressure of lots of tests.\n \"I don't think anyone could have ever imagined stuff like this,\" she says\n\"But the fact is that we have got through it - and hopefully our results tomorrow will prove that we have worked hard.\"\nTo those people who criticise the value of this year's grades, Syeda says: \"I would tell them they should try and be in our place.\"\n\"I don't think anyone can know what it is like unless you are experiencing it yourself.\"\nShe is aiming to sit A-levels next year and study English literature at the University of Cambridge."

      "text": "The UK economy grew by 4.8% between April and June, according to official figures, as most businesses emerged from lockdown.\nData from the Office for National Statistics showed that the expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) was fuelled by retail, restaurants and hotels.\nEducation also boosted the economy as schools reopened in the second quarter.\nHowever, the figure was slightly below the 5% the Bank of England expected. \nThe UK economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic. \nGrowth in the second quarter contrasts with the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank by 1.6% while Covid restrictions were still in place. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: \"Today's figures show that the economy is recovering very strongly, exceeding many people's expectations.\n\"But I'm not complacent. The economy and our public finances have experienced a significant shock. It is going to take us time to fully recover from that.\"\nCapital Economics said it expected the economy to return to pre-Covid levels later this year.\n\"We are comfortable with our view that monthly GDP will return to its February 2020 pre-pandemic size by October and that the economy may yet surprise most forecasters by emerging from the pandemic without much scarring,\" said senior UK economist Ruth Gregory.\nIn April, non-essential retailers reopened, as well as gyms, hairdressers and outdoor dining. In May, pubs, restaurants and cafes were allowed to serve customers indoors, while theatres, galleries and cinemas were allowed to open their doors.\nThe main driver of growth was consumer spending, which rose by 7.3% over the quarter, ahead of expectations.\nThe UK is not just a nation of shopkeepers, but social animals. And it's that large proportion of \"social spending\" - on hotels, restaurants and leisure - that made our economy so vulnerable to lockdowns. The UK was the fastest shrinking of the G7 nations in 2020 and conversely, maybe one of the fastest of the big players to recover in 2021 as restrictions lift. \nThe consumer has led the way, driving output to within 5% of pre-pandemic levels, despite the Delta variant of Covid. It's growth that some feared just months ago would take far longer to materialise. \nBut what happens next is still uncertain. The safety net that has protected livelihoods - the furlough scheme - ends in October. Economists think there will be some job losses, albeit far fewer than assumed a year ago. \nThe biggest risk, however, will come from further variants and a resurgence in infections and restrictions. Policymakers are assuming we're done with the latter. A year ago, they were predicting there'd be no more national lockdowns: let's hope they're right this time. \nIf so, the impressive vaccination rate in the UK should stand the economy in good stead - others are not that fortunate. Be it health or wealth, it's access to vaccinations that may increasingly make the difference between the haves and have-nots as we try to escape the grip of this pandemic. \nAt the end of the quarter in June, the monthly growth is estimated at 1%, slightly more than most economists expected. \nPantheon Macroeconomics said that nearly half of the economic expansion in June came from activity in the health sector, \"reportedly due primarily to a surge in people visiting their GP\".\nHargreaves Lansdowne said: \"Fears that the arrival of the Delta variant and the 'pingdemic' that followed might impact growth have so far not really materialised.\" \nHowever, the ONS revised down its figure for May from 0.8% to 0.6% during a month of heavy rainfall. \nThe UK economy has been supported by the government's wage support scheme. But from July, employers have had to make contributions to staff wages and the scheme is set to close by the end of September.\nThe economy is rebounding, but the pandemic is still having an impact on the restaurant trade, according to Asma Khan, founder and owner of Darjeeling Express, a family-owned Indian restaurant in London's Covent Garden.\n\"It's been very tough,\" she told the BBC. \"The insecurity has been very hard to deal with, the way the lockdown happened in March of last year.\"\nMrs Khan said that she was \"grateful\" for the furlough scheme which allowed her to keep her entire staff on.\nEven so, \"I was still liable for all the rents and all the financial costs mounted up,\" she added.\nThere is, however, \"a lot of optimism\", Mrs Khan said. People are booking months in advance to dine at her restaurant, which recently welcomed comic actors Paul Rudd, of the US, and Canadian Dan Levy.   \n\"We had, I think, 1,300 bookings in five hours when we started opening all up all the other dates,\" she said.\nMrs Khan said the changing nature of the UK's travel restrictions remained a concern. She said businesses like hers in central London were \"completely dependent on tourists\".\n\"People are worried because this whole insecurity of the red list, the amber list. This fluctuation is basically deterring a lot of people, except the very brave, to want to come in because they don't know whether the status of their country is going to change by the time they're ready to go back.\"\nFollowing the release of second-quarter GDP figures, Mr Sunak said the UK had \"the fastest quarterly growth rate among the G7 economies\". \nBut Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \"The UK economy almost certainly was the hardest hit by Covid-19 in the G7.\"\nWhile UK GDP is still 4.4% smaller than its pre-pandemic level, the US has seen its economy recover, making it 0.8% larger than before Covid. \nPantheon also said France's economy was 3.3% below pre-pandemic levels, Germany was 3.6% below and Italy's GDP was 3.8% lower.\nJapan and Canada have yet to report up-to-date figures, but Pantheon said: \"Both economies had fared much better than the UK in previous quarters.\"  "

      "text": "The \"right owner\" is being sought for a 19th Century island castle off the west coast of Scotland. \nKinloch Castle is a former hunting lodge on the Isle of Rum - one of the Small Isles, south of Skye. \nThe castle and most of the island are owned by NatureScot, formerly Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).\nIt says Kinloch Castle is not for sale on the open market but it is looking for a \"beneficial owner\" for the property and its grounds. \nNatureScot said the lodge requires restoration work and a future owner would need to conserve and preserve the property, while minimising its impact on the environment.\nA Fort William-based businessman has submitted a plan to the Scottish government for the refurbishment of Kinloch Castle.\nAngus MacDonald, who owns a bookshop and a cinema is a former vice president of National Trust for Scotland, said his plan would require some public money along with funds he would raise. \nTwo years ago, Kinloch Castle Friends Association (KCFA) proposed developing part of the castle into a 51-bed B&B and later turning other areas into a museum.\nBut SNH rejected a request to transfer the property to KCFA as a community asset.\nThe agency said it was concerned the group did not have funds to maintain the castle.\nNatureScot said over the past nine years it had been delivering a conservation plan to maintain and protect the castle, in agreement with Historic Environment Scotland and Highland Council. \nA spokeswoman said: \"We feel the castle will best support the community with the right owner, and we have been working towards that goal over the past few years.\n\"While Kinloch Castle is not currently on the open market for sale we continue to work to identify a beneficial owner for the castle and grounds.\"\nNatureScot said any future owner would need to contribute towards \"three key objectives\".\nThe spokeswoman said they were securing the conservation and preservation of the castle, contributing to the sustainability of the Rum community and enhancing nature on Rum and, thirdly, minimising the castle's impact on the natural environment.\nKinloch Castle was built in 1897 as a hunting lodge for Lancastrian industrialist George Bullough and he had it luxuriously furnished.\nThe property fell into decline after World War One and was taken over by SNH's predecessor, the Nature Conservancy, in 1957.\nIt has required extensive restoration work over the years."

We are of course open to working with authorities overseas; we will give them every assistance if they ask us for anything within the law, obviously.\n\"As a result of what's going on, I've asked my team to have another look at the material. \n\"No-one is above the law.\"\nIn August 2019, US financier Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York's highly secure Metropolitan Correctional Center, prompting some to question whether he killed himself.\nThe month before, the 66-year-old had pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.\nPreviously, Epstein was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions.\nIn a secret plea deal in 2008, he admitted soliciting prostitution from a minor and received an 18-month jail sentence. During this time, he was able to go on \"work release\" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week.\nVirginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's many accusers, alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 2001 and 2002, when she was 17 years old.\nMs Giuffre says the abuse happened in London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.\nOn Monday, Ms Giuffre began legal proceedings against 61-year-old Prince Andrew. She alleges that he engaged in sexual acts without her consent, knowing how old she was and that she was a sex-trafficking victim.\nIn a Newsnight interview in November 2019, the prince said he had \"no recollection\" of meeting Ms Giuffre. He denies all allegations, maintaining there are \"a number of things that are wrong\" about her account.\nSpeaking to LBC, Dame Cressida said the force had made the \"right decision\" in November 2019 by choosing not to open an investigation into Ms Giuffre's allegations.\nAt the time, the force concluded it was \"not the appropriate authority\" to investigate the matter."

      "text": "There has been a rise in the number of top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland.\nGrades A* and A were awarded to just under 40% of entries, which is up from 37.1% in 2020.\nAs exams were cancelled for a second year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pupils' results were based on grades calculated by schools.\nSimilar arrangements for A-levels saw a record number of entries awarded top grades on Tuesday but the rise in results at GCSE has been less dramatic.\nIan Bell, principal at Movilla High School in Newtownards, said his pupils had done \"remarkably well in some very difficult circumstances\".\n\"Sometimes I think it's very easy for people to jump to conclusions where they think 'oh it seems that they were easier' or 'it was an easier process' and I would certainly refute that and I'm sure every other principal in the province would refute that too,\" he said.\n\"Hopefully, things as they start to return to normal, we will be able to get back to our normal procedures, but I don't think the examination systems have anything to lose from learning some of the lessons we've had, especially over the last two years.\"\nThe pupils at the high school said their whole summer had \"been leading up to results day\" and that there were a lot of nerves in the last few days.\n\"Last night I was really nervous, but I was excited to come and see everybody, \" one pupil said. \n\"It was hard going into this year because you're going into uncertainty and you didn't know would exams go on or would exams be cancelled, but I think we had to just go head on and do the best that we possibly could.\"\nAbout 29,000 students in Northern Ireland received their GCSE results on Thursday.\nOthers received results for BTec, vocational or entry level qualifications.\nTeachers will have used evidence like classwork, homework, coursework and in-class tests to provide grades for pupils.\nGrades calculated by schools were also used to give pupils their GCSE results in 2020 after exams were cancelled.\nThere has been some criticism that the assessment system used has led to a grade-inflation, but one Londonderry principal believes there are some benefits for pupils not having to sit traditional GCSE exams. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in the Waterside, said there was \"certainly elements I prefer\" about using an evidence-based method for the determination of grades.\n\"Examinations and grades are pre-determined by the exam boards so the number of kids who achieve an A*, A or B is already pre-determined,\" he said.\n\"By removing the algorithm I think we are actually seeing what young people are actually capable of before examination boards are in a position to manipulate results.\"\n2019 was the most recent year in which a full exam series took place.\nJust under a third of all GCSEs in Northern Ireland were awarded A* or A in 2019, and that has risen to 39.9% of entries this year.\nAbout nine in every 10 (89.6%) entries were awarded A* to C grades, similar to 2020.\nGirls continue to outperform boys in achieving the top grades.\nJust under half of entries from girls in 2021 received A* or A grades compared to about a third of entries from boys. \nIn 2020, almost one in every eight GCSE entries (12.4%) in Northern Ireland was awarded the top A* grade, a rise from 8.1% of entries in 2019.\nMore than one in three GCSE entries (37.1%) received the top A* or A grades in 2020.\nThe vast majority of GCSEs in Northern Ireland are taken by pupils through the exams board CCEA and results were available from 08:30 BST on Thursday.\nMany pupils went to their school to pick up results as unlike A-levels, they cannot receive them online. \nAbout 98% of entries are through CCEA, with the remainder through English and Welsh exam boards.\nThat means some pupils in Northern Ireland received results in the form of numbers as well as letters.\nThat is because GCSEs in England are graded numerically from nine to one.\nPupils use their GCSE results to progress to A-level, courses in further education, training or employment."

One is for her estate and financial affairs, while the other is for her as a person. \nMr Spears stepped down as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health issues but has continued to oversee her business arrangements.\nIn recent months, she has sought to remove him from his role and has called for him to be charged with \"conservatorship abuse\".\nThe 39-year-old told a judge that she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children.\nMr Spears has consistently denied any accusations of wrongdoing and has expressed concern for his daughter's wellbeing.\nThe prolonged legal row gained renewed attention earlier this year following the release of Framing Britney Spears, a documentary that centred on the conflict over the singer's guardianship.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It's quite thick, quite nasty stuff,\" said Mr Preece. \n\"We've been tasked with treating about a million gallons of it, getting it off the ship, treating it, safely discharging the sea-water back into the sea, and then collecting the oil.\"\nThe equipment has been loaded into shipping containers in Llangennech over the past two weeks.\nThe journey by sea would normally take five to six weeks to complete, but the US Coast Guard would speed up the process and lead it into port, Mr Preece said.\n\"It'll get to Atlanta in around three weeks and our team will be on a plane waiting for it, and we'll deploy immediately and it's probably about a month's work.\"\nCaitlin Davies, an environmental engineer at the company, explained how the equipment - which looks like a giant bath - would work.\n\"It uses a system which allows the oil to be separated from the water,\" she said.\n\"By putting the aluminium charge onto the electrodes, it coagulates the smaller particles into bigger particles.\n\"It's a really clever but simple solution.\""

      "text": "UK police have been involved for months in the case of a British man arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying for Russia, the Met boss has said.\nThe 57-year-old man, named only as David S, worked at the British embassy in Berlin and was detained on Tuesday.\nHe is alleged to have passed documents to Russian intelligence for money. \nMetropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said police had been working closely with German authorities and the UK government over the issue.\nShe told LBC Radio: \"I think it's a very good example of international co-working.\"\nMI5 and other UK agencies had been working alongside bodies including the BKA - Germany's federal criminal police office - and prosecutors ahead of the arrest in Potsdam, outside Berlin. \nThe man's home and workplace have been searched and he appeared before a judge on Wednesday. He was ordered to remain under arrest pending further inquiries.\nDame Cressida said: \"If this person is charged, we will support any trial, wherever that may be.\n\"At the moment the Germans are most certainly handling it.\"\nShe added of the arrest that \"these things are, thankfully, very rare\". \nThe arrest of a security guard at the British Embassy in Berlin is a reminder that old-fashioned spying has not gone out of fashion.\nStories of betrayal, bribes and stolen documents make for racy tales with all the elements of spy fiction. \nBut the truth is that nothing in the Berlin case should surprise us. What is alleged to have happened is not very unusual, even if we do not hear about it very often.\nIn recent years, Western states have called out Russia for the aggressive actions of its intelligence services - for instance the GRU, Russian military intelligence, using nerve agent in Salisbury or blowing up an arms depot in the Czech Republic, both actions killing innocent people. \nBut you will not hear the same complaints when it comes to the allegation involving the British Embassy in Berlin.\nThat is because if it turns out to be true, following the legal process, then it would be business as usual when it comes to more traditional spying.\nRead more here.\nThe Metropolitan Police said officers from the force's Counter Terrorism Command - which investigates alleged breaches of the Official Secrets Act - were liaising with their German counterparts. \nThe suspect is understood to have been a security guard working as a contractor at the embassy. Prosecutors said he was hired as a local staff member at the embassy.\nLord Ricketts, former national security adviser, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"we're probably not looking at highly classified information being passed to the Russians - a security guard would not have access to that\".\nHe said it was a \"reminder\" that \"old-fashioned\" methods of spying were still being carried out, not just cyber-hacking and social media disinformation. The fact German and British authorities knew about the alleged spying and tracked it show that our defences \"are not in bad shape at all\", he added. \nMPs have called for a security review of UK embassy contractors following news of the man's arrest, with Chris Bryant - chair of the all-party parliamentary Russia group - saying it could be \"one of the most serious security breaches at a UK embassy for many years\". \nAnd Tobias Ellwood, chair of the commons defence select committee, called on the government to review the security of all contractors working at UK embassies, the Daily Telegraph reported.\nThe German Foreign Ministry said it was taking the case \"very seriously\", with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas telling reporters: \"Spying on a close ally on German soil is absolutely unacceptable and we are in full solidarity with our British friends.\""

Spy services still seek out people whom they can recruit to pass on sensitive information and that makes embassies a prime target with Berlin still a major focus. \nAnd it is not just diplomats who have direct access to secrets who spies are interested in. \nLocally hired staff - ranging from drivers to security guards to cleaners - can also be targeted with cash or other inducements because they can provide access to rooms to plant listening devices or gather information themselves.\nGerman and UK relations with Russia are already strained after several high-profile incidents in recent years. \nThe UK accused Russia of being responsible for a 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury against Sergei and Yulia Skripal - an accusation Russia has repeatedly denied.\nBoth survived the attack. But a local woman died after she came into contact with a perfume bottle thought to have been used in the incident and then discarded.\nGermany meanwhile treated Russian dissident Alexei Navalny after he was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian flight last year. Russian authorities have also repeatedly denied their involvement in this incident.\nLast month German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Joe Biden vowed to stand together \"against Russian aggression\"."

      "tags": "Television,EastEnders",
      "text": "Actress Una Stubbs, who appeared in some of the best-loved shows on British TV from the 1960s to the 2010s, has died at the age of 84.\nShe found fame in Cliff Richard's 1963 film Summer Holiday before starring in hit sitcom Till Death Us Do Part.\nThe actress went on to appear in shows like Worzel Gummidge, The Worst Witch, EastEnders and Sherlock.\nHer agent paid tribute to her as \"a wonderful actress\" and \"graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend\".\nAfter starting her career as a dancer, Stubbs became a fixture on the small screen in the 60s when she played Alf Garnett's exasperated daughter Rita in Till Death Us Do Part and the 1980s follow-ups 'Til Death and In Sickness and In Health.\nShe was also a regular on the game show Don't Say A Word and its follow-up Give us a Clue, and became a favourite of young audiences as Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge.\nShe starred in another children's hit, The Worst Witch, in the late 1990s, as well as playing Caroline Bishop in soap EastEnders and appearing in comedies The Catherine Tate Show and Benidorm. \nHer last major role saw her play Sherlock's landlady Mrs Hudson in the BBC drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch.\nSherlock creator Steven Moffat remembered Stubbs as \"the loveliest light on Baker Street\".\nWriting on Instagram, he said: \"What a woman, what a talent, what a star - and just about the kindest, nicest, funniest person you could meet.\n\"I don't know how anyone even starts summing up that career - Till Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, the incomparable Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge... and, of course, the irreplaceable heart and soul of Sherlock\".\nIn a statement, Stubbs' sons Joe and Christian Henson and Jason Gilmore said: \"Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.\"\nHer agent Rebecca Blond, who represented Stubbs for more than 20 years, said she would \"miss her enormously and remember her always\".\nThe veteran actress had been ill for a few months, Blond told BBC News.\nShe said: \"We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\"She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist.\"\nStubbs exhibited in the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition, and her passion for art made her the perfect choice to co-host BBC One's The Big Painting Challenge in 2015.\nBroadcaster Gyles Brandreth paid tribute, saying it was \"a sad day\".\nHe wrote: \"Such a funny, lovely, gifted lady - a marvellous actress with a special style & a great (and impish) sense of humour.\"\nFellow dancer and actress Bonnie Langford said it was \"such a loss\".\nShe said: \"She made everything look so effortless. A consummate professional, kind, gracious, elegant, versatile and fun. Her Aunt Sally was a masterclass alone.\"\nOther tributes came from across the entertainment industry.\nStubbs started her career at the age of 16 as a chorus girl at the London Palladium, and was the Dairy Box girl in TV chocolate adverts in the 1950s.\nShe auditioned for Summer Holiday as a dancer, but ended up being given one of the main roles. She had no formal acting training, saying: \"I've been to the school of observation. I learned everything there.\"\nShe maintained a long careerthat saw her remain popular with successive generations. \"Different age groups recognise me for different things,\" she said.\nShe starred on stage as well as screen, including in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night - which she described as her most challenging part - and in the original cast of the National Theatre adaptation of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.\nIn her private life,Stubbs was married and divorced twice, to actors Peter Gilmore and Nicky Henson, and had three sons.\nShe once said she felt she spent most of her life \"doing two jobs, motherhood and acting, and only being so-so at both of them\".\nBut she also spoke about the resilience she found under pressure. \"I am amazed at the strength I found,\" she told The Guardian in 2007.\n\"When I think of what a lightweight girl I was, expecting roses to grow around the door, expecting everyone to be perfect... but of course, it's the layers you grow that make you into a person.\n\"I realise on reflection that I'm a strong person - even steely, actually - but I had no idea.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,Ashraf Ghani,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Afghanistan has replaced its army chief, as Taliban militants continue to make rapid advances.\nInsurgents have taken control of 10 of the country's 34 provincial capitals.\nOn Thursday the Taliban said they had taken the strategically important Ghazni city, which is on the road to the national capital Kabul.\nPresident Ashraf Ghani earlier flew to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif - traditionally an anti-Taliban bastion - to try to rally pro-government forces. \nThe removal of the country's army chief, General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, was confirmed to the BBC on Wednesday. He had only been in the post since June. \nHis successor will have to deal with escalating violence across the country, as the Taliban continue their offensive. US and other foreign troops have all but withdrawn following 20 years of military operations.\nMore than 1,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the past month, according to the UN.\nAlso on Wednesday, President Ghani held crisis talks in Mazar-i-Sharif with ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and prominent ethnic Tajik leader Atta Mohammad Noor about defending the city.\nMr Dostum, a veteran commander, was quoted as saying: \"The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped.\"\nFor years, Mr Ghani tried to sideline the warlords in an attempt to boost the Afghan National Army, and now he is turning to them in his hour of need, the BBC's Ethirajan Anbarasan says. Earlier this week, the president also agreed to arm pro-government militia.\nMazar-i-Sharif lies close to the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and its loss would mark the complete collapse of the government's control over the north of Afghanistan.\nIn Kunduz, another northern provincial capital, hundreds of government soldiers - who had earlier retreated to the airport after the Taliban overran the city - have now surrendered.\nAccording to local media reports, the Taliban have now taken over Kunduz airport and the army corps stationed there have surrendered.  \nLocal sources told the BBC that fighting was also raging in eastern Afghanistan's Ghazni on Wednesday, after Taliban insurgents entered the city centre. \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) humanitarian group later said intense \"street-by-street\" fighting was taking place in Afghanistan's second-largest city Kandahar. \nThe Taliban claimed to have taken over the city's prison, though this has not been confirmed. \nAccording to one US official speaking to CBS News, Afghanistan's capital could fall to the Taliban in as soon as 90 days. \nHowever, the official told news agency Reuters that it was possible for the Afghan security forces to halt the Taliban's momentum by putting up more resistance, adding that the fall of Kabul was not a \"foregone conclusion\".\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was reportedly citing US intelligence. \nIn the city of Lashkar Gah, in Helmand province, ICRC director-general Robert Mardini said hospitals were \"struggling to deal with the dead bodies\". \nIn addition to fighting on the ground, US and Afghan planes have been carrying out air strikes against Taliban positions in the country. \nThe Washington Post newspaper on Wednesday cited unnamed officials as saying the capital Kabul could fall to the Taliban within 90 days, based on US military assessments. \nA senior adviser to Mr Ghani, Waheed Omer, dismissed this prediction. \"It's hard times for us but we know that we will prevail,\" he told the BBC. \n\"They have managed to gain some territory but it's not about territory.  It's about the people.  The people don't want them and they will soon find that it was a mistake to actually attack our people,\" he said. \nAnalysis by Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Kabul bureau editor\nMazar-i-Sharif, now a major economic centre, has historically been the supply gateway from the former Soviet Union to the country.\nThe government in Kabul recognises the importance of the city, and that is why the Afghan president visited it to hold talks with local leaders and former warlords.\nThe last time the Taliban took the city was in the 1990s. This happened without any heavy resistance after a deal was done with a rival of Abdul Rashid Dostum.\nBut now he is one of the key leaders fighting the militant group.\nWith violence surging, thousands of people have been fleeing in search of safety. \n\"We have no money to buy bread, or get some medicine for my child,\" a 35-year-old street vendor who fled Kunduz province after the Taliban set fire to his home told the BBC. \n\"We had a good life, but because of the bomb blasts we lost our home\", a woman who fled the city of Pul-e-Khumri said. \nAfghan politician Shukria Barakzai said the Taliban gains were \"a red signal for the entire globe\"."

      "tags": "Surgery,NHS England,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A record number of people - more than 5.45 million - are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England. \nThe June figures show a mixed picture - with the numbers waiting more than 18 weeks or a year both down, but a rise in those waiting more than two years.\nMany have joined the waiting list in recent weeks, as more people are referred for treatment. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would look at \"what more we need to do\" for the NHS.\nNHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said the summer had seen some of the highest numbers ever coming forward for care.\nAnd he said the health service had made \"effective use\" of the additional resources it had been given to address the Covid backlog.\nThe data published today also shows:\nBut in signs of progress, the number of patients waiting longer than 18 weeks for care has dropped by almost 25,000 to 1.7 million.\nThe number having to wait more than a year to start treatment was 304,803 in June - down from 336,733 the previous month.\nMost hospitals are doing all they can to reduce the number of long waits for operations.  \nSome trusts in England have been given extra funding if they can get their volume of work above pre pandemic levels - extending operating theatre hours with smarter use of the time available and cutting down delays with pre-op checks for patients are among the policies being adopted.  \nTrusts are working more closely with GPs, pharmacists and other local health providers to try to reduce the number of patients requiring hospital treatment, so freeing up resources for those who most need it.  \nBut dealing with new referrals and tackling the backlog are huge tasks.  And millions more who did not come forward for treatment during the pandemic may now do so. \nThe issue is rising rapidly up the political agenda. Growing waiting lists are also evident in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  \nSajid Javid, the Health Secretary, discussing the issue in England has said more money will be required.  The question is how much.  There could yet be battles with the chancellor in the run up to the spending review in the autumn.\nThe health secretary said waiting lists would rise as people came back to the NHS for healthcare having not done so during the worst periods of the pandemic.\nMr Javid said: \"We estimate there's probably some seven million people that ordinarily would have come forward to the NHS that stayed away, understandably, during the height of the pandemic.\n\"We want those people to come back. I don't know how many will come back but, even if half of them came to the NHS - and can I just stress I really want people that need to be seen by the NHS to know the NHS is there for them and they should come forward - but as they do I think waiting lists will rise because there will be a huge increase in demand.\"\nHe said an extra \u00a329bn had gone into the NHS and social care this year.\nChris Hopson of NHS Providers told the BBC the NHS was \"going at full pelt\" to try to get through the backlog.\nBut he added: \"They're having to cope with the fact that we're 8,000 beds short compared to the normal number of beds we have because of infection control, and we've got large numbers of staff self-isolating. \n\"We're also in the peak leave period and we've got very large numbers of people coming in for urgent and emergency care - and we've still got 5,000 Covid patients in hospital beds.\"\nHe said a long-term funding settlement was vital.\nProf Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said a \"volatile mix of pressures\", including Covid control measures and staff shortages due to pinging, was hindering the NHS's ability to address the surgery backlog. \nOf the 5,727 patients waiting more than two years for treatment - a 46% increase on the previous month - the RCS says most need hip and knee replacements, gallbladder removals or hernia operations.\nIt warns some may be unable to work, or carry out day-to-day tasks, while they wait for their procedures.\nSome have warned the number on waiting lists could rise much further, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warning it could rise to 14m by the end of 2022."

I will never forget,\" he said in a police statement read out in court.\nAnother victim, a woman who was pushing a bike, also survived being stabbed. In a highly unusual move, neither of their names were mentioned during the hearing.\nThe man told police he did not realise at first that he had been stabbed.\nThe inquest heard he walked three or four metres before falling over, at which point two passers-by, Katherine Day and Thomas Baldwin, performed first aid.\nHe said: \"They cut off my clothes, they saved my life. I will never forget.\n\"The woman was crying, saying: 'Please don't go. Where's the ambulance?'\n\"It really hurt when they put me on the ambulance bed. I heard someone say: 'We can't drive, he's not going to make it.'\"\nHe added: \"Thank God for the doctors, or I would be dead.\"\nOn Wednesday, the inquest heard that a nine-man surveillance team had been following Amman after his release from prison, 10 days before the stabbings.\nOne officer told the inquest how he feared for his life after witnessing Amman \"plunge\" a knife into the upper back of a woman wearing a bright pink jacket. \nIn her statement, read out to the jury, the victim said she suddenly felt pain in her right shoulder.\nShe told police: \"I took about four steps forward when I heard people shout: 'She's been stabbed.'\n\"I thought if I had been stabbed, why were people walking past me? I doubted myself.\n\"Due to the pain I dropped my bike on to the floor.\"\nShe suffered a small wound to her back and was discharged from hospital later that day.\nThe inquest previously heard there had been concerns about Amman's imminent release from HMP Belmarsh on 23 January 2020, part-way through a 40-month sentence for preparing and engaging in acts of terrorism. \nHowever, the request was turned down by the governor because the offence Amman was jailed for did not justify him serving further time in prison.\nJurors have also heard that Amman was spotted buying items later used to fashion a fake suicide belt but the Probation Service was \"satisfied\" that in making the purchases he had not breached any licence conditions.\nThe inquest has been adjourned until Friday."

      "tags": "Monetary Policy Committee (MPC),UK economy,Bank of England",
      "text": "The recent surge in consumer prices will be a temporary phenomenon as the UK emerges from the pandemic, the Bank of England's governor has insisted. \nAndrew Bailey told the BBC the jump in inflation was understandable given the \"bumpy\" economic recovery. \nOn Thursday, the Bank warned inflation will hit 4% this year, higher than previously forecast and double the 2% rate it aims for.\nBut policymakers decided to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.1%.\nThe Consumer Prices Index hit its highest for almost three years in June, at 2.5%, as food and energy costs rose.\nRate-setters on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have diverged over whether rising prices fuelled by the economic recovery are temporary and when they might start to fall.\nHowever, the committee, currently made up of eight members, not the usual nine, voted unanimously in favour of holding rates at their record low.\nMr Bailey said the rapid recovery in demand for some goods was outstripping supply, contributing to price increases, but many of the inflation drivers are \"temporary\".  \nBut he added: \"I want to emphasise that we don't take this [inflation rise] lightly by any means. We at the Bank of England are very focussed on inflation. But we do expect it to come back to target.\"\nSome economists argue the Bank should rein in its economic stimulus programme - quantitative easing - but there was also no change on Thursday.\nThe central bank will keep up its \u00a3875bn QE following a seven to one vote in favour. Michael Saunders was the one vote against. He argued that the government bond purchases should be cut from \u00a3875bn to \u00a3830bn.\nThe Bank's former chief economist Andy Haldane called for a \u00a350bn cut in QE before he left the committee after its June meeting.\nDespite rising prices, the MPC concluded that it would start to fall back to the target rate of 2%.\n\"The Committee's central expectation is that current elevated global and domestic cost pressures will prove transitory,\" the Bank said in a statement.\nBut it added: \"Nonetheless, the economy is projected to experience a more pronounced period of above-target inflation in the near term than expected in the May Report.\"\nSeparately, the Bank's latest economic growth outlook published on Thursday forecast a gross domestic product (GDP) rebound of 7.25% in 2021.\nAlthough this is unchanged from the previous estimate of 7.25% in May, it is still the fastest growth rate for 70 years.\nHowever, the Bank now expects the economy to then grow by 6% in 2022, compared with a previous 5.75% forecast.\nMr Bailey said he was very confident about the economic recovery. \"We were criticised a year a go for being over-optimistic about the bounce-back,\" he said. \"But the element that has come out much better than anybody forecast is unemployment.\"\nWith more than 70% of adults in Britain now fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and most social-distancing rules lifted, Britain's economy has recovered strongly since its 10% crash in 2020.\nA resounding headache is not just a common symptom for those suffering from coronavirus but for those who have to deal with the economic fallout. \nInflation's usually the last thing central bankers worry about after a recession - particularly one that's the deepest since the Great Frost of 1709. \nBut this isn't a typical crisis. The Bank of England is bracing for inflation, to hit 4% by year-end, twice its target. However activity and employment have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels, the path of recovery uncertain once furlough ceases and given the risk of renewed restrictions. \nHow to balance those? The Bank is betting on the spike in inflation being transitory, reflected in the main bottlenecks in supply chains and the like as the economy adjusts. \nSo it's opted for a wait-and-see approach rather than risk undermining the recovery, leaving not just rates but its asset buying programme, QE, alone. \nEconomists think the first rate hike may still be at least a year off. \nThe Bank may well be right but if not, there could be a steep price for inaction. Interest rates changes typically take anything up to two years to impact prices. Leave it too late, and they may have to rise further and faster than otherwise - a fresh headache, this time for borrowers. "

All the information out there and it's really hard to process and get to a point where you're in a mindset where you know what's happening. \n\"There's such a high level of uncertainty you're constantly worried or actually doubting what's going to happen next. \n\"When you have goals for the future it's something to help you get through this but when you're in the circumstances we're in now, it's really hard to find the motivation and a purpose for what you're doing now.\"\nTo try and stay positive Angel has been trying to get out for walks during her school breaks or watch Netflix. \nShe said she has also tried to learn some sign-language during lockdown and attempted yoga.\nEmrys, 11, from Bridgend, said he misses not having the structure of a school day and seeing his friends.\nHe added: \"I'm a social person. I have friends, I chat with them, I play with them, and it's hard not being with my friends but I mean the family will have to do.\"\nHe and his six-year-old sister, Clara, have enjoyed going for walks with their parents and have been learning some new skills including washing dishes, cooking dinner and baking cakes.\nMeanwhile, 11-year-old Sophie has found it difficult to not get bored during long periods of time in the house. \n\"I'd say I cope OK with it at some points, but then not okay with it at other points,\" she added. \nAlicia is studying for her A-levels and has friends who have dropped out of their studies this year because of the stress and anxiety caused by the uncertainty about exams and their futures.\nThe 17-year-old also said it was \"heart-breaking\" not being able to see many of her close friends for almost a year.\nShe added: \"My thoughts are, it's less of a luxury now, I need to be able to go out to see them and to work.\"\nBefore the pandemic, Sarah, 16, from Swansea enjoyed going to her local youth club and took part in a local drama group but it how now moved online, giving a different experience. \n\"It's quite sad because I used to enjoy being able to do those things whenever it was on, but I think I'm getting used to do everything online,\" she said.\nAs a person who does not cope very well with not knowing what will happen next, the pandemic has caused anxiety at times for Sarah.\n\"I am finding it quite scary but hopefully things will change and I'll be able to go back soon,\" she said. \n\"I think if you're really struggling with something, talking really helps so it would be nice to see people in person.\"\nChildren's helpline MEIC Cymru said it had seen a 10% increase in the number of calls from young people, parents, and carers during the pandemic compared with previous years.\nStephanie Hoffman, Head of Social Action at Promo Cymru, the charity which runs the helpline, said: \"We're seeing what I'd say are many more substantive contacts, so a lot more contact dealing with really serious issues to do with social well-being, mental health and relationships, as opposed to what we might have seen more of in the past. \n\"Now we're dealing with situations which can be quite complicated.\"\nOf the survey, Ms Holland said: \"We've heard a lot from adults showing concern for children at the moment, such as parents, carers and professionals working with children about the potential impact of the lockdown on children. \n\"Those voices are important to hear, but it's also important we hear directly from children and young people because sometimes they can be surprising.\"\nWe know that Covid-19 vaccinations have been on people's minds in Wales - with many wanting to know when they or their loved-ones will receive theirs. \nIf you have a question about this issue, a story you'd like to share or a query about anything else related to coronavirus, you can sent it to us using the form below.\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

I went to the hospital school for a while, but my teachers and friends from Merrill kept in touch with me and I just wanted my old life back.\n\"My balance is still not great, and my left side is quite weak, but I am getting there.\n\"I was on two different wards, and my ambition now is to get a job on one of those wards. \n\"I know what a difference it makes when you have a nice nurse - mine were amazing.\"\nHis long-term foster mum Helen Westfield said: \"Jason was adamant that he was going to sit his exams and even when some of them clashed with hospital appointments, he went in and sat them on his own. We are all so very proud of him.\"\nGrace Hoskins, vice principal of Merrill Academy, said: \"After everything Jason has been through it was extremely pleasing that he was keen to continue with his GCSEs and we hope that his dream of becoming a nurse is one day fulfilled.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "A new analysis suggests the current level of UK spending to combat climate change is lagging behind what advisers say is needed.\nA study by the pressure group WWF says new green policies in the March 2021 Budget add up to just 0.01% of GDP.\nBut the government's own advisory Climate Change Committee has said 1% of national wealth - or GDP - must be spent every year in the UK to ensure climate targets are met.\nIn November the prime minister promised \u00a312bn for a 10-point plan \"green industrial revolution\".\nWWF says its research also shows that some Budget policies that encourage pollution totalled \u00a340bn - far more than the PM's green plan.\nIt says that the freeze on fuel duty is costing the Treasury some \u00a311.2bn in the financial year 2019-20 alone, rising to \u00a313.9bn in 2022-23 if the freeze continues.\nA Treasury spokesman defended the government's record and said a comprehensive strategy for financing the \"green revolution\" would be outlined in the autumn.\nBut WWF says the UK won't remotely deliver on its own promise of a 78% CO2 cut by 2035 at the current rate of annual spending.\nIsabella O'Dowd from WWF said: \"It's not yet too late to prevent global warming from rising above 1.5\u00b0C - it is in our hands.\n\"But to do that, the UK government must play its part by keeping every climate promise it has made.\"\nThe government's aim is to reduce UK emissions to almost nil by 2050 - that's a trajectory the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said would save the world from the very worst catastrophes that lie ahead.\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"\"The UK is a world leader in the global effort to tackle climate change, growing our economy by 78% while cutting emissions by 44% over the past three decades and being the first major economy to legislate to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\"\nThe government has been urged recently by some of its own backbench MP to spell out exactly how the low-carbon transition will be funded. They fear the UK may take expensive action to cut emissions when other nations sit back.\nThe Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC recently that policies to shield poor families from higher heating bills would be published soon.\nChris Stark, head of the advisory Climate Change Committee, told BBC News the WWF report is \"an interesting snapshot\" of government spending on the net zero transition.\nHe continued: \"We estimate the cost of reaching net zero to be around 1% of GDP per year, a mixture of public and private money.\n\"Not all of that funding will be reflected in the government's Budget, but it's vital that a net zero test is applied to the Treasury spending review in the Autumn if we are to have a fighting chance of delivering net zero.\"\nRecent analysis for the All-Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group suggests the government is also falling short at a policy level on net zero ambitions.\nIts report said ministers have fully or partially met just 61 out of 135 policies recommended by the advisory Climate Change Committee. \nThe prime minister has promised a full suite of policies before the vital climate summit known as COP26 that he's hosting in Glasgow in November.\nExperts say if the UK must prove how it can decarbonise its own economy to show other nations that it's economically possible.\nOne of the government's new policy initiatives is to promote hydrogen as a power source. A hydrogen strategy is due soon.\nLobby groups are pressing for widespread hydrogen use in home heating.\nBut a report from Cornell and Stanford Universities warns that using hydrogen could increase emissions overall unless it's made by electrolysis from surplus wind power.\nThat's because the most common current method of getting hydrogen is to split it from natural gas, which produces high carbon emissions.\nFollow Roger @rharrabin"

      "text": "Scotland's first electric-powered aircraft has taken to the skies from a new test centre in Orkney.\nOne of the twin engines in Ampaire's six-seater Cessna Skymaster has been replaced with an electric motor.\nThe company believes it could pave the way to retrofitting inter-island and short-haul flights with greener technologies.\nIt is the first low-carbon aircraft to fly at the \u00a33.7m sustainable aviation facility based at Kirkwall airport.\nThe plane was built in 1974 but has been retrofitted at the company's headquarters in California.\nAfter initial test flights in Hawaii, it was shipped to Scotland for its first flight across open water between Orkney and Wick, a 37-mile (60km) flight.\nTest pilot Justin Gillen told BBC Scotland: \"It's the only hybrid-electric airplane that I know of flying today. \n\"As the airplane is approaching, you hear the propeller which is a kind of blade-through-air sound and then you hear the throatier sound of the engine.  With our electric engine, you hear the propeller but that's pretty much it.\"\nOn Ampaire's aircraft, the engines are built at the front and back of the cockpit in a \"push-pull\" design.\nIt's the front engine which has been replaced with an electric motor that's a fraction of the size.\nA huge battery pack has been attached to the underbelly which can keep the aircraft running for several hours in the right conditions.\nAbout 90 minutes of rapid charging would provide around an hour of flight.\nSusan Ying from Ampaire said: \"It will fly cleaner, be more efficient and more economical.\n\"It will start as a short-haul but eventually, as the technology's improving, it could go into medium to long-haul.\"\nThat would require batteries to continue shrinking but the developers are confident that will happen.\nAir travel is a notoriously difficult industry to decarbonise because the aviation fuel has a high energy density.\nBut it's a high emitter of carbon dioxide which needs to be reduced to net-zero if we are to halt climate change.\nIsland air links in Scotland are regarded as \"lifeline\" for communities who live there, and so battery-powered flights are under serious consideration.\nDougie Cook, from Highlands and Islands Airports, explained: \"If aviation is to survive throughout the world, then it needs to decarbonise and it needs to do so quite quickly. So this is a really important first step.\n\"The links around Orkney are called lifeline links for a reason and it's absolutely essential that we keep them going so electric aviation will guarantee that and make it sustainable for the future.\"\nFlights currently operate from Kirkwall to six of the furthest islands - Eday, Sanday, Stronsay, North Ronaldsay, Westray and Papa Westray.\nThe test facility is expecting to play host to other forms of low-carbon flights, including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels."

I only managed to unfasten myself.\"\nMr Stvolkin added that he had managed to escape through the cockpit's smashed window from a depth of about eight or nine metres.\nAccording to preliminary information, the aircraft was travelling from the village of Nikolayevka to the Kuril Lake and the Khodutka volcano when it crashed, the emergencies ministry said.\nThe Mi-8 - a medium twin-turbine helicopter - was carrying tourists from Moscow and St Petersburg, Ria Novosti reported.\nThe mountainous Kamchatka peninsula - more than 6,000 km (3,730 miles) east of Moscow - is popular among tourists.\nIn July, all 28 people on board an aircraft died in a crash on the peninsula."

      "title": "Who are the Taliban?",
      "tags": "Pakistan,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, but the group has seized control of the country once again following a rapid offensive.\nThe capital, Kabul, was the last major city to fall to the offensive that began months ago but accelerated as the hardline Islamists gained control of territories.\nThe group entered direct talks with the US back in 2018, and in February 2020 the two sides struck a peace deal that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces. Other promises included not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nBut in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security forces and civilians, advancing rapidly across the country.\nThe Taliban, or \"students\" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam.\nThe promise made by the Taliban - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\nFrom south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence. In September 1995 they captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, and exactly one year later they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahideen that resisted the Soviet occupation. By 1998, the Taliban were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.\nAfghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene. Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.\nBut the Taliban also introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations for those found guilty of theft. Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.\nThe Taliban also banned television, music and cinema, and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage.\nPakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise, but there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.\nPakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan. It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the group.\nAt one point, the Taliban threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas they controlled in the north-west. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home in the town of Mingora.\nA major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan though. At least three key figures of the Pakistani Taliban had been killed in US drone strikes in 2013, including the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud.\nThe attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. The Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.\nOn October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition launched attacks in Afghanistan, and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed. The group's then-leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. \nMany senior Taliban leaders reportedly took refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guided the Taliban. But the existence of what was dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" was denied by Islamabad.\nDespite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban gradually regained and then extended their influence in Afghanistan, rendering vast tracts of the country insecure, and violence in the country returned to levels not seen since 2001.\nThere were numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base.\nHopes of a negotiated peace were raised in 2013, when the Taliban announced plans to open an office in Qatar. But mistrust on all sides remained high and the violence went on.\nIn August 2015, the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death - reportedly of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan - for more than two years. The following month, the group said it had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of Mullah Omar.\nAt around the same time, the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.\nMullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remains in control of the group.\nIn the year following the US-Taliban peace deal of February 2020 - which was the culmination of a long spell of direct talks - the Taliban appeared to shift their tactics from complex attacks in cities and on military outposts to a wave of targeted assassinations that terrorised Afghan civilians.\nThe targets - journalists, judges, peace activists, women in positions of power - suggested that the Taliban had not changed their extremist ideology, only their strategy. \nDespite grave concerns from Afghan officials over the government's vulnerability to the Taliban without international support, the new US president, Joe Biden, announced in April 2021 that all American forces would leave the country by 11 September - two decades to the day since the felling of the World Trade Center. \nHaving outlasted a superpower through two decades of war, the Taliban began seizing vast swathes of territory, before once again toppling a government in Kabul in the wake of a foreign power withdrawing.\nThey swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking their first provincial capital on 6 August . By 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country."

      "text": "Boris Johnson believes the UK will see a \"steady\" economic recovery post-pandemic, but he warned there would be \"bumps on the road\" in the next year.\nSpeaking to LBC, the PM said job numbers were \"increasing\", but a \"cautious approach\" was needed.\nIt comes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it expected UK economic output to grow by 7% this year - up from the 5.3% it predicted in April.\nMeanwhile, Labour is calling for more flexible conditions for working people.\nThe party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that more people would return to workplaces as the economy emerges from Covid if employers allowed staff to compress their hours or work at different times.\nShe added: \"We've seen throughout this pandemic that employees have acted tremendously well, especially some for those who are on the most insecure and vulnerable contracts, and it's time for us to stop that practice where we do see unfortunately huge amounts of exploitation.\"\nThe UK saw its GDP - the value of all goods and services in the economy - dramatically fall in 2020, down 9.9% from the previous year, as a result of coronavirus restrictions, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it was the hardest hit of the world's major economies in the early months of the pandemic. \nUnemployment has not been as bad as feared due to government support schemes, such as furlough, but the Bank of England expects the unemployment rate to reach around 5.5% in the autumn when the schemes come to an end.\nAnd the government has had to borrow huge sums of money to pay for the schemes and support the economy - \u00a3299bn from April 2020 to 2021, the highest figure since records began in 1946.\nHowever, borrowing this year has been less than expected as the economy starts to reopen - \u00a353bn, which is \u00a314bn less than forecast in March.\nMr Johnson told LBC that, thanks to the vaccine roll-out, England had been able to \"open up in the way that we said we would\" as the final part of his roadmap for easing restrictions. \nHe said: \"That is enabling us to make the economic progress that we are and so you're seeing the job numbers increasing.\n\"I think the rest of this year... there will still be bumps on the road, but I think you'll see a story of steady economic recovery and perhaps quite fast economic recovery as well.\"\nPointing to the report from the IMF, the prime minister added: \"Jobs are coming back.\n\"It's clear that... if we're sensible and we continue to take a cautious approach that we can see a very, very strong recovery.\"\nMs Rayner said the world of work in a post-pandemic UK needed to change to offer more flexibility to staff.\nLabour has launched a set of policies this week calling for workers to be given \"full\" employment rights from day one, which it said would \"fundamentally change the economy\".\nThese rights would include being able to ask for flexible working, which the deputy leader said would lead to a better work/life balance for staff.\nShe told Today: \"Flexible working should be mandatory and should be available for all people. \n\"This is about making sure there is that healthy balance where people can get into gainful employment and have that security... so they can live happy fruitful lives. \n\"And at the moment, the balance is incorrect.\" "

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan",
      "text": "About 600 UK troops are to be sent to Afghanistan to assist British nationals to leave, the government has announced.\nIt comes as the Taliban seized the country's second-largest city, Kandahar, as well as the cities of Ghazni and Herat.\nMilitary personnel will provide protection and help relocate UK nationals, Afghan staff and interpreters.\nLast week the Foreign Office advised all British nationals to leave.\nIt is estimated that about 4,000 British citizens were still in the country.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said the security of British nationals, military personnel and former Afghan staff was the government's first priority and that it \"must do everything we can to ensure their safety\".\nMr Wallace said deployment of troops, who will be arriving in the coming days, was a \"pre-planned phase\" and was to \"enable the next step of leaving\". \nBut the Ministry of Defence said the additional deployment was \"in light of the increasing violence and rapidly deteriorating security environment in the country\".\nThe UK's ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, will continue to lead a small team in Afghanistan which will relocate within Kabul to a more secure location, the MoD said.\nAs well as British nationals, the embassy will help the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), which has already supported more than 3,100 former Afghan staff and their families to move to the UK, including 1,800 in the last few weeks, the MoD said.\nThe US has also said it is sending 3,000 military troops to the airport in Kabul to help evacuate a \"significant\" amount of embassy staff on special flights.\nBy Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent\nIt was always likely, this close to the end of the Nato mission to Afghanistan, that events would appear to accelerate. We are, after all, getting out. \nBut as they made their careful arrangements, planners did not necessarily anticipate the speed of the Taliban's advance, or the weakness of an Afghan military the US and its allies spent almost two decades building up. \nWhat they wanted was an orderly withdrawal, with the Afghan government able to hold its own. \nWhat we're facing, instead, is something altogether more chaotic.\nPerverse though it might sound, sending troops in to get people out was always going to be part of the plan. \nSo too was the relocation of the British embassy to a more secure (and as yet undisclosed) location.\nBut the withdrawal of an unspecified number of embassy personnel, with the Americans making a similar move, is clearly being driven by events on the ground. \nWith US officials warning that the Afghan government could fall in as little as 30 days (a worst case scenario, it has to be noted), these feel like the crisis plans everyone hoped they wouldn't have to use. \nThousands of civilians have been displaced and fled to Kabul to try to escape the fighting.\nAnd the UN estimates that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the past month.\nMakeshift camps have been established on the outskirts of the capital, while many others have reportedly been sleeping on the streets or in abandoned warehouses.\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the MoD had his party's full backing on sending troops to help the evacuation.\n\"We share widespread dismay that the security situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating so much faster than forecast,\" he said, adding that while the UK's forces were withdrawing \"we cannot walk away from the people of Afghanistan\".\nIn a heartfelt series of posts, Conservative chairman of the Commons Foreign Select Committee Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, tweeted that the decision to withdraw was \"like a rug pulled from under the feet of our partners\". \n\"That's why I'm angry. It's wasteful and unnecessary. And why it's personal? Because I've seen what it costs and what sacrifices are being thrown away,\" he wrote.\nTory colleague Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Defence Select Committee and also served in the Army, told the BBC we \"should really be reconsidering what's going on\" in Afghanistan. He warned the withdrawal of troops was leaving the country to a \"massive humanitarian disaster\" and said that it would allow terrorism to \"raise its ugly head again\".\nThe Taliban has moved with speed, seizing new territories and cities almost daily, as the US and other foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan after 20 years of military operations.\nThey now control around a third of the country's regional cities and most of northern Afghanistan.\nOn Thursday the Taliban took control of Herat, the third largest city, followed by the second-largest city, Kandahar.\nSources have told the BBC that the southern city of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, has also been taken by the militants, although this has also not been confirmed.\nMeanwhile the taking of the strategically important Ghazni increases the likelihood the group could take the capital Kabul.\nAre you in Afghanistan?

In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. \nAlthough renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities.\nThe maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban.\nUS forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents.\nAlthough most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital.\nThe airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. \nCustoms duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. \nBut, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. \nDisruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular.\nUS troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.\nBut despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas.\nA  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. \nIn 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Afghan service"
