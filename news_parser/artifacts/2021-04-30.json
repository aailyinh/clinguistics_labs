      "title": "Gaunt Navalny attacks Putin as network is disbanded",
      "tags": "Russia,St Petersburg,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "Alexei Navalny has appeared in court from prison, head close-shaven and face gaunt, and accused Vladimir Putin of attempting to rule Russia \"forever\" and caring only about \"clinging to power\". \nIt is the opposition politician's first public appearance since starting a 2.5-year jail term, seen as punishment for his fierce criticism of the Kremlin. \nNavalny spoke via videolink, his prison kit hanging loosely after a recent 24-day hunger strike over his treatment. \nHis language was as robust as ever.\nPresident Putin was a \"king with no clothes\", he said, who was \"robbing the people\" and depriving Russians of a future. Russians were being \"turned into slaves\".\nThe judge rejected Navalny's appeal against a fine for defaming a Soviet World War Two veteran who had appeared in a pro-Kremlin video. Navalny said his weight in jail had fallen to 72kg (11.3 stones), the same as he weighed in school.\nBut even as the Kremlin critic spoke, another court across Moscow was discussing a petition by the prosecutor to ban all his political organisations as \"extremist\".\nAnticipating the court's ruling, Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov announced that some three dozen \"Navalny headquarters\" were being disbanded, to protect staff and supporters from prosecution. \nThe offices were set up in 2017 ahead of Navalny's attempt to challenge Vladimir Putin for the presidency; he was barred from even joining the race. \nOn Monday, the Moscow prosecutor suspended all activity by the offices, pending the court decision. The activities of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have also been restricted. \n\"To make it clear, this decision destroys our political organisation in Russia,\" Leonid Volkov told the BBC this week. He was speaking from abroad, where he has lived since 2019 for safety as he faces multiple criminal charges himself. \n\"There is no way we can continue to operate in the country,\" the activist said, adding that the extremism laws carry punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\nThe \"extremist\" branding would be toxic, as the Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia have found out: since the religious organisation was outlawed in 2017 on the same grounds almost 500 of its followers have faced criminal prosecution. Dozens are serving hefty sentences. \nSo, across Russia, staff who once worked for Team Navalny have rushed to clear out their offices and delete social media accounts and chats.\nIn St Petersburg, where supporters queued round the block four years ago when the politician swept into town to open his first regional headquarters, there is now no sign his team were ever there.\nThe front door of their office is shuttered. Inside there is just a couple of chairs, a coat rack and a printer gathering dust.\nIrina Fatyanova, who ran Navalny's St Petersburg team until Monday, stresses that she has now severed all ties with the organisation, at risk of being labelled an extremist.\nBut she says pressure from the authorities had increased steadily since January, when Alexei Navalny returned to Russia after recovering from a nerve agent attack in Siberia. Arrested on arrival, he has been behind bars ever since.\n\"Since January, I don't think there's been one calm day when I didn't worry about a knock on my door, or some criminal case,\" Irina confided, telling me she had been followed, detained and had her house searched in recent weeks. \nBut the \"extremism\" label takes the danger to another level. \nIrina describes the move as a personal tragedy and now plans to try running for local election, independently of Team Navalny - a plan Leonid Volkov suggests may be replicated across the country. \n\"Things are frightening, but what happens if we're all scared off?\" Irina reasons. \"I don't want to look the next generation in the eyes and be ashamed.\"\nBut the strength of Alexei Navalny's movement was two-fold: his charismatic leadership and the structure he put in place, supporting activists across the country. \nMobilising via social media, they have staged street protests, promoted anti-Kremlin candidates for election and conducted anti-corruption investigations against top-level officials that have gone viral. \nBut tolerance of their activities has ended.\nIn St Petersburg this week, even a wall painting of Alexei Navalny lasted just four hours before police arrived, followed swiftly by municipal workers with daffodil-yellow paint.\nWithin moments, Navalny's image was obliterated.

      "text": "Coronavirus infections in the UK are back to levels seen at the end of last summer with around one in 1,000 people infected, ONS data suggests.\nIn the week to 24 April, infections fell in all four nations of the UK and were 20 times lower than in January.\nIt comes as a new UK study has found very small numbers of people have been admitted to hospital with Covid several weeks after having one vaccine dose.\nMore than half of the UK population has now received a first vaccine jab.\nMeanwhile, BBC analysis shows about 22 million people are now living in areas where there were no Covid deaths in April.\nThe Office for National Statistics survey, which tests a random selection of thousands of people in the community, estimates that about 66,000 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in mid-April.\nThis is down from the previous week's estimate - and way down on the figure of 1.25 million infected at the peak of the second wave in January.\nThe ONS estimates that in the week to 24 April:\nFor England, it is the lowest figure since the week to 5 September, when the estimate stood at one in 1,400, while in Wales it is the lowest since 10 September.\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, who joined the survey later, the figures are the lowest since their estimates began.\nProf Paul Hunter, professor in medicine from the University of East Anglia, said the ONS figures confirmed the decline in daily cases across the UK and was evidence that the recent relaxation of restrictions had not had a negative impact.\n\"That there is in fact no evidence of an increased transmission risk is reassuring that, for the time being at least, it looks like the current roadmap is still on target,\" he said.\nBut other experts are more cautious, saying we should continue to be aware of the possible spread of variants and any changes in infection numbers.\nThe coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, in England is now estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the latest government figures.\nLast week the R value, which represents the number of people each person with Covid will go on to infect, was between 0.8 and 1.0.\nWhen the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below 1, it means the epidemic is shrinking.\nThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the estimate did not necessarily mean R was definitively above 1 in some areas in England, just that the uncertainty meant it could not be ruled out.\nWhen the number of cases falls to low levels, R estimates can be subject to large fluctuations so it is a less robust way of representing what is happening.\nThe UK has reported another 15 Covid-related deaths within 28 days of a positive test, and a further 2,381 new cases.\nThe government's latest figures also show 34.2 million people have now received a first dose of a vaccine, while 14.5 million people are fully vaccinated having received two jabs.\nIn other developments:"

The pet was found unharmed at the scene. \nSpeaking at a press conference in nearby Aylesham, Assistant Chief Constable Tom Richards, of Kent Police, declined to rule out she was killed by a stranger.\nHe said: \"There is no evidence that any of her possessions were missing.\"\nHe said it was a \"rare and isolated\" event, and that Ms James had earlier been working from home and was not in uniform when she was found. \nWhen asked if it was a possibility that she had been attacked by someone she came across in her line of work, he replied: \"We are considering all possible motivations and all possible options. We certainly have not established that at this stage.\" \nMs James joined the force as a PCSO in 2008 and had more recently been working with victims of domestic abuse while based in Canterbury. \nMr Richards said: \"She was a hugely-devoted, passionate individual who was completely committed to serving the people of Kent. \n\"My heartfelt thoughts go out to her family, her friends and of course her colleagues.\"\nEarlier, Kent Police's deputy chief constable Tim Smith told BBC Radio Kent: \"We've got hundreds of officers working on that investigation while we try to establish exactly what happened to Julia, and more importantly who did this to Julia and why.\n\"We are working very hard to identify a motive and we're working very hard to identify who may have committed this. We don't have any clear suspects at this time.\" \nMr Smith added: \"We just don't know why this has happened.\"\nHe said he was \"unable to say either way\" if the attack had been sexually motivated. \n\"We are keeping a very open mind about the motive.\" \nBy Simon Jones, BBC South East reporter\nPeople have been arriving again this morning, bringing bouquets of flowers and taking a quiet moment of contemplation. \nWhat people are asking, above all, is, is it safe for them to go out? Is it safe for them to walk their dogs? \nPolice say there is an increased presence of officers in this area and they understand that if people are feeling worried they should go and talk to the officers on the ground. \nDetectives are also desperately appealing for people who have information to come forward.\nMs James's nephew Karl James told 5 News his aunt was \"just a lovely person\".\nHe said: \"Obviously it's been a real shock. I work away, but my wife is here - heavily pregnant - and with young kids, so she's on edge at the moment too.\n\"So I've come home and just waiting for answers - that's the worst bit really.\"\nDetectives have appealed for anybody who was in the area on Monday or Tuesday to come forward.\nPolice have been carrying out searches of woodland and nearby fields, and Ms James's home was cordoned off.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Hull,Fishing,Brexit,Fishing industry",
      "text": "Fishing crews have been \"disastrously let down\" by the government's failure to reach a deal with Norway, UK Fisheries chief executive has said.\nUK fleets will not have access to Norway's sub-Arctic seas, following the breakdown of UK-Norway negotiations. \nOne trawler, which catches 10% of fish sold in chip shops, will be tied up for a year following the collapse in talks.\nThe government said it had offered a \"fair deal\" but the two sides were \"too far apart\" to agree a deal this year. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said fishing communities had been \"betrayed by the prime minister\".\nThe UK's departure from the EU means it is no longer part of the European Common Fisheries Policy and instead negotiates with Norway directly over fishing catches. \nThe UK and Norway have a basic post-Brexit agreement on fishing, but annual negotiations are still needed to pin down detailed numbers. \nThose negotiations are meant to conclude by the beginning of each year, but the timing of the EU-UK trade deal in December 2020 had a knock-on effect that meant everything was delayed. \nThe failure to reach a deal means Norwegian vessels will also lose access to UK waters in 2021. But one of the main species they catch is blue whiting, and a lot of that is caught in the first couple of months of the year which have already gone. \nUK vessels, on the other hand, fish throughout the year for cod. \nAnd as warmer sea temperatures push cod stocks further north, they cannot replace the cod they have been catching in Norwegian waters by fishing in UK waters instead. \nMany people in the fishing industry felt let down by the EU-UK trade deal, but that was about its future potential.  \n\"This is actually a loss of real fishing opportunities,\" says Barrie Deas of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, \"and in that sense we've gone backwards\".\nBig Scottish fishing firms will be able to catch more mackerel because of the absence of Norwegian vessels in UK waters, but most of the rest of the industry will be bitterly disappointed. \nThe government will argue that it had to stick to its guns in a tough negotiation, and there was always likely to be some upheaval as a result of the UK exit from the Common Fisheries Policy. \nIt changes the UK relationship with big fishing countries like Norway, as well as with the EU itself. \nAndrew Crook - president of the National Federation of Fish Friers - warned that it could increase the price of fish and chips.\n\"We rely on having some domestic catch to keep the market stable and any lack of competition is going to have an impact on prices,\" the fish and chip owner said.\n\"We are already seeing large increases on almost all of our supplies and we fear this will continue.\" \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4, Jane Sandell chief executive of UK Fisheries, said the failure to reach an agreement would mean her firm having only 40% of the fishing opportunities of previous years. \nHer Hull-based company employs approximately 100 crew and Ms Sandell said the news would be \"absolutely devastating\" for those workers and their families.\n\"It means so much in this area to our history and our culture... we are in total shock, we never believed this would actually happen.\"\nShe said the lack of a deal would mean their Kirkella trawler - which catches around 10% of all the fish sold in the UK chip shops -  would be \"tied up\" for a year.\nShe also criticised the government for failing \"to deliver on all of the deals we previously had through the EU with third countries\".\n\"So with the Faroes and Norway, the deals have failed and Greenland they didn't even bother starting,\" she told Today.\nThe National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations said the failure to reach agreement would lead to more vessels trying \"to make a living in the constrained waters of the North Sea and West of Scotland\".\nJohn Dixon, 31, from Hull, is second mate onboard the Kirkella and spoke to BBC reporter Pritti Mistry. \nHe says his \"heart dropped\" when he heard the news.  \n\"We're waking up in the morning and we're literally panicking about when money is going to come in.\n\"The fishing community is so large here it's unbelievable and we're all struggling. \n\"I've been fishing since I was 17 - it's in my blood.\"\nHe says two generations of his family have been fishermen - his dad, his granddad and uncles.\n\"If it collapses here and now it's going to stop with me - my son's already told me he wants to go to sea. \n\"In all honesty it's disgusting - you feel betrayed.\" \nElspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said opportunities in the coming year would be \"very constrained\" but added that they \"appreciate the efforts of negotiators who worked hard to try to secure a deal... during what is an extremely difficult year for the industry\".\nA spokesman for the environment department said: \"We have always been clear that we will only strike agreements if they are balanced and in the interests of the UK fishing industry.\n\"We put forward a fair offer on access to UK waters and the exchange of fishing quotas, but we have concluded that our positions remain too far apart to reach an agreement this year.\n\"We will continue to work with them [Norway] over the course of the year.\" \nLabour leader Sir Keir said the prime minister had \"made big promises\" but had \"failed to deliver\". \n\"Whichever way people voted - leave or remain - they don't deserve this,\" he added."

      "tags": "Policing",
      "text": "From the Edward Colston statue toppling during a Black Lives Matter demo to violent clashes over the Police and Crime Bill, Bristol has seen major protests in the past two years. \nThese events have put policing, policy and power in the spotlight, especially for young people, whose voices -  as the flag-bearers for all sorts of social justice initiatives - need to be heard, according to University of Bristol professor of politics Simon Tormey.\nAhead of the Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner (PCC) elections on 6 May, the BBC asked young voters in the area what they know about the role.\nA PCC is not a serving member of a police force but they are voted for, by the public, to hold forces to account.\nMegan Davis, 24, from Gloucestershire, said it was \"incredibly important people are better informed\" about PCCs.\n\"It's not something I've heard of and I would like to think that I'm politically aware and active,\" she said.\n\"People need to be made more aware otherwise they may turn up to the ballot unsure of how to cast their votes, which means they won't be voting for what they believe in and that's unfair on constituents.\"\nSpeaking about the policing of the Kill The Bill protests, which she took part in in both Bristol and Cheltenham, she added: \"I agree with people who criticised the policing in Bristol because it was incredibly violent, but then in smaller rural communities like Cheltenham the policing was more of a community presence which was positive, and from that we can see how policing can be different.\n\"People who attended the more recent protests are incredibly angry at the police and their violence and how they treated women at [the Sarah Everard vigils] needs to be changed, and it seems that change could be made by voting.\"\nBristol student Robert Graham, 26, said: \"The protests weren't right and police got hurt so we need a PCC who isn't afraid to defend the police and speak out.\"\nHe wants to see a PCC that will offer \"more engagement on local crime issues and who will be seen commenting on police activity more\".\n\"I think the police did a great service during the protests, stopping people from doing criminal damage but, from the new PCC, I do want someone who will put even more police on the streets to stop crime from happening to make the streets feel safer,\" he added.\n\"That would also help if any violent protests happen again.\"\nJemima Brett, 27, said past experiences with police had made her feel \"distrust\" towards them, and is unsure how she will vote.\nThe care worker from Bristol said: \"I feel negative about police forces in general because of how I have seen them treat people close to me badly in the past.\n\"I will be voting in the elections but I don't know much about the PCC role.\n\"It's clearly important, so people should be informed more. \n\"There should be more posters on the streets and things online about it, not just a letter through the post because people don't always read that stuff.\"\nBristol environmental activist Mya-Rose Craig, 18, said she did not know about the PCC role and was \"surprised\" to learn about it.\nShe said: \"I've always felt like the police is a very separate entity from the people and thought we didn't have a say in anything.\n\"I will be voting on that now because police funding isn't necessarily going where I would choose for it to go.\n\"Personally I would prioritise money going into communities rather than any more being spent on riot gear and riot vans, so I will vote based on that.\"\nBristol engineer and activist Owen, 20, said he did not think the role will help make the changes he thinks are \"necessary\" to make his local police force better.\nHe said: \"I have a lot of thoughts about the way that policing is done in Bristol and the policing model of the UK in general because I think that police forces consistently get things wrong, and I don't think the PCC role is going to change that.\n\"So, personally I'm not massively invested in it.\" \nThe protests on the streets of Bristol have focused much attention on policing. They have also exposed differences between the candidates who seek to become the next Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner. \nAnd, in a contest where all too often the contenders want similar things (basically \"more police, less crime\"), it is refreshing to see some clear blue water opening up.\nOne snag though; a PCC does not decide how a protest is policed. She or he sets the budget for the force and agrees its priorities. \nBut operational matters, such as how officers handle late-night confrontations with demonstrators, are determined by the chief constable.\nThey do though have one other significant responsibility which can influence the way policing is carried out. The PCC appoints the chief constable. That is a fairly rare event, but it will be one of the first challenges awaiting the new PCC, with Avon and Somerset's Andy Marsh retiring in July."

That number peaked at 164 patients on 18 April 2020, with more than 40 patients each in critical care in Aneurin Bevan and Swansea Bay health boards. \nDespite alternative treatments in the second wave to try to avoid critical care as much as possible, at the peak there were still 150 patients in critical care in mid-January.\nThe average number of Covid patients in hospital beds - 260 a day in the last week - has also equalled the lowest figure back in September. These include recovering Covid patients.\nOnly nine Covid patients were admitted to Welsh hospitals on Thursday and the weekly average is at a low - 13 a day.\nIt comes as the latest swab survey from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates Covid infections are continuing to fall in Wales.\nIt takes throat and nose swab tests from thousands of volunteers in Wales.\nIt suggests 1,900 in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 24 April, a decrease.\nThis is one in 1,570 people - or 0.06%. This compares to one in 840 people in the previous week.\nONS estimates that 170 new people a day are getting Covid in Wales but this is down from 5,000 a day in mid-December.\nThe positivity rate estimate is lowest in Wales than the other UK nations. It's 0.10% in England, 0.16% in Scotland and 0.11% in Northern Ireland.\nEstimates range from one in 300 people in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, covering east Wales, to one in 560 people in Swansea Bay."

The total number killed by the pandemic in France is now at least 104,079, Johns Hopkins University estimates.\nThe president was strongly criticised for rejecting calls to order a third national lockdown earlier to bring down a spike in infections. \nMr Macron said it was time to start \"resuming our French-style way of life\", and people needed \"conviviality\", culture and sport. But he added that people needed to remain \"careful and responsible\"."

      "text": "Five people have been arrested over the violent theft of two French bulldogs belonging to US artist Lady Gaga.\nIn February attackers shot dog walker Ryan Fischer in the chest and took Lady Gaga's dogs, Koji and Gustav.\nMr Fischer had to have part of his lung removed but survived the attack, and has since left the hospital. \nOn Thursday Los Angeles police announced they had charged three suspects for the incident itself as well as two others as accomplices.\nJames Jackson, Jaylin White and Lafayette Whaley - aged 18, 19, and 27, respectively - have been charged with attempted murder and robbery. \nOfficers also charged 40-year-old Harold White - Jaylin White's father - and Jennifer McBride, 50, with accessory to attempted murder. Ms McBride returned the dogs to the police two days after the theft, after Lady Gaga had offered a $500,000 (\u00a3359,000) reward for their return. \n\"Detectives were able to establish McBride had a relationship [with] Harold White,\" a Los Angeles police press release said. \nAll four men charged were \"documented gang members\", the release said, without giving details. \nPolice said they did not think the attackers were aware Mr Fischer worked for Lady Gaga - whose real name is Stefani Germanotta - when they attacked him.\nBut evidence suggested they knew \"the great value of the breed of dogs\", which was \"the motivation for the robbery\".\nMr Fischer was walking the three dogs in a residential area of Hollywood at night when the attackers pulled up in a car.\nHe was shot in the chest with a semi-automatic handgun and two of the dogs were taken. Another of Lady Gaga's bulldogs, Asia, was unharmed in the incident. \nMr Fischer later described Asia as his \"guardian angel\" who gave him the determination to survive. \n\"My panicked screams calmed as I looked at her, even though it registered that the blood pooling around her tiny body was my own,\" he wrote in an Instagram post in March.\n\"I cradled Asia as best I could, thanked her for all the incredible adventures we'd been on together, apologised that I couldn't defend her brothers, and then resolved that I would still try to save them\u2026 and myself.\""

      "text": "Bars and restaurants are struggling to recruit enough staff and some may not be able to fully reopen in May, after thousands of workers left the sector. \nVenue owners say they are expecting huge demand from customers, but staff shortages may mean they have to limit opening hours.\nFigures suggest more than one in ten UK hospitality workers left the industry in the last year.\nRecruitment site Caterer.com said the pandemic and Brexit were to blame.\nSome have managed to find alternative employment, but a high proportion may have left the UK altogether, the recruiter said. \nSo, although many hospitality workers were laid off during the last 12 months, restaurateurs are now finding it hard to fill places.\nCelebrity chef Michael Caines is one of those finding recruitment difficult. \nHe operates two restaurants on the Cornish coast and a hotel in Exmouth. A beach bar and restaurant in Exmouth is also due to open.\nHe is currently trying to hire 20 new staff members across the group.\n\"Without question, recruitment is a challenge,\" he said. \n\"All of the businesses are extremely busy. For the next three, four months our hotel is completely booked up, so we're desperately trying to recruit enough staff.\"\nMr Caines said Brexit and the pandemic have led European workers to leave and not return, but he said another problem is the number of workers still on furlough.\nWhile they are waiting to return to work they are less willing to switch employers.\n\"A lot of people feel very concerned about leaving a job where they qualify for furlough to take the new job where they wouldn't qualify for furlough if there was another lockdown,\" he explained.\n\"So there's a bit of nervousness from an employee's point of view.\"\nMr Caines is hoping roles will be more easily filled when students break up from college and university and start looking for summer work.\nRestaurants and bars have been allowed to serve food and drink outdoors since 12 April, while indoor dining is expected to restart from 17 May. And many UK hospitality venues are hoping pent-up demand and a more UK-focused holiday season to translate into a bumper summer.\nAs a result, recruitment was a \"growing issue\", said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. It was more acute in some areas, such as London, than others, she added, and could mean some venues struggle to reopen.\nThe trade association said chef vacancies are among the most difficult to fill. But restaurant owners have reported staff shortages across all types of roles.\nSpecialist recruiter, Caterer.com, said the number of vacancies on its website had grown by more than 85% in the last few weeks, with 22,000 roles now being advertised.\nBut it pointed to figures from the Office for National Statistics suggesting 355,000 fewer people were employed in hospitality than a year ago. Pre-pandemic around 3.2 million were employed in the sector including bars, restaurants and hotels. \n\"Many restaurants, pubs and bars have experienced a sudden surge in business due to built-up customer demand and an increase in consumer confidence which is great news for the hospitality industry,\" said Caterer.com director Neil Pattison.\n\"However, the impact of the pandemic, combined with Brexit has the potential to create a significant recruitment challenge for the sector and we are likely to see the skills shortage it once faced starting to return.\"\nOne person who turned his back on a full-time job in hospitality after work dried up due to Covid, is 42-year-old father-of-one Colum Maher.\nHe has 20 years of experience working in bars and restaurants, but last December he took up a full-time job in customer services with Sky. \nHe now says something very special would have to come along for him to go back into hospitality full-time. \n\"I've had 15 to 20 jobs in the hospitality sector over the years, from bartender to bar manager to chef, so it's an industry I love and know inside out.\n\"However, I found myself with no work during the pandemic and I needed to find some job security. Now I'm able to work every week, Monday to Friday, so I have no plans to change that now.\"\nBut he hasn't turned his back on the industry completely - he's registered with a speciality hospitality recruitment website Coople, to look for weekend work.  \n\"I personally think it's going to take the hospitality industry three to four years to get back on its feet,\" he says.\n\"I'm at a stage of life when I cannot afford to wait for opportunities to start appearing again - I don't think a lot of pubs will even reopen.\n\"However, if this doesn't work out, then I know I have something I can hopefully fall back on.\"\nBefore Brexit a lot of the UK's hospitality workforce was made up of workers from overseas, including from the EU, but hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have left the UK over the last year and it is unclear whether they will return.\nLuke Garnsworthy, who owns Crockers Henley, a hotel and fine dining restaurant in Oxfordshire, and Crockers Tring in Hertfordshire, said he is struggling to recruit enough staff for when his restaurants open fully next month.\nAs well as chefs, he is hoping to hire front-of-house staff and waiters.\n\"I've put adverts out and I thought I was putting the net out into a sea full of fish but it's not been like that at all.\"\nMr Garnsworthy would like to employ between 45 and 50 staff at his Henley venue where the headcount is currently only at 12.\nHe said senior team members will step in to fill roles where necessary, but the restaurant was only likely to be able to open five days a week instead of seven.\nRecruitment in hospitality has always been a challenge, even before the pandemic, but is \"definitely worse now\", according to Mr Garnsworthy.\n\"We are perceived as unskilled, so the country looks down their nose\u2026 and young people are not interested.\"\nHe wants them to know that although it is hard work \"the days of Gordon Ramsey shouting\" are over at least.\nRestaurant owner and Masterchef The Professionals finalist Sven-Hanson Britt also operates several venues.\nHe said staff turnover in hospitality is normally high, but he too said furloughed staff are sticking with their existing employer.\n\"There's not that ebb and flow with talent because people are staying put.\n\"It's very difficult at the moment and finding anyone for senior positions is hard.\"\nMr Britt is hoping to recruit pastry chefs, chocolatiers and a sommelier.\n\"We can't seem to find anyone in that arena,\" he added.\nThe business took on a number of staff in October but application rates this time around are far lower.\n\"Some businesses closed or went bust and people felt let down by their employer or the industry as a whole,\" he said.\n\"I know a lot of people who have moved on to something different.\""

      "text": "UK house prices rose by 7.1% compared with a year ago, the Nationwide has said, prompting one analyst to suggest the market is \"on the boil\".\nThe building society said the average property price had risen by \u00a315,916 in the last year, to reach \u00a3238,831.\nThe Nationwide said increased savings during lockdown meant some first-time buyers would be better placed to afford a home.\nBut prices could continue to rise as homes available did not match demand.\nLucy Pendleton, from independent estate agents James Pendleton, said: \"This market is on the boil.\n\"Silly season might be just around the corner. That's when a seller's market becomes entrenched against a backdrop of very high demand and you start to see open houses for properties that are nothing special and a return of gazumping.\"\nThe Nationwide said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 2.1% compared with March.\nYear-on-year price growth accelerated as well, driven in part by the extension in stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic set-up, with demand for more space coming to the fore.\n\"Our research suggests that while the stamp duty holiday is impacting the timing of housing transactions, for most people it is not the key motivating factor prompting them to move in the first place,\" said Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner. \nThe state of the market saw some people queuing overnight outside an estate agent in Wales as homes for a new development went onto the market.\nNationwide's figures are based on its own mortgage data, and it suggests that the market is likely to continue to be busy for the next six months, owing to the stamp duty relief.\nPrice growth was also likely to accelerate, it said, with demand expected to exceed the supply of homes on the market.\nThat is generally bad news for first-time buyers, but the building society said some - with the help of their families - would be in a better position having had the opportunity to save money during the pandemic.\nA typical first-time buyer would need to save \u00a319,500, or around 50% of their gross earnings, for a 10% deposit on a mortgage, Mr Gardner said.\n\"The fact that around a third of first time buyers in England in 2018-19 said that friends or family helped them to raise a deposit through a loan or gift suggests that the recent surge in savings will help some, but that the impact won't be spread evenly,\" he said.\nOn the same day, Barclays boss Jes Staley said that built-up savings would help to create the biggest economic boom since the aftermath of World War Two in the UK.\nThe Nationwide said that the longer-term outlook for the housing market was more \"uncertain\".\n\"If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply,\" Mr Gardner said.\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: \"Numbers like this won't last forever but the market may not begin to unwind until the busy summer season is out of the way.\""

We will have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nData from the Office for National Statistics suggests that coronavirus infections in the UK are back to levels seen at the end of last summer, with about one in 1,000 people infected. In the week to 24 April, infections fell in all four nations of the UK and were 20 times lower than in January. Elsewhere, a new UK study has found very small numbers of people have been admitted to hospital with Covid several weeks after having one vaccine dose.\nShoppers across Northern Ireland have been queuing outside stores as lockdown eases - allowing retailers to reopen. Gyms, pubs, restaurants and cafes can also now reopen, while hospitality businesses must only operate outdoors - our picture gallery shows people enjoying drinks in the sun. Here's a reminder of the rules across the UK. \nOfficials in Delhi have been urged to find more sites for cremations as the city's morgues and crematoriums are overwhelmed by masses of Covid deaths. A second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of India, with 386,452 new cases reported on Friday - the biggest one-day increase on record for any country.\nTeletext Holidays faces legal action unless it pays back \u00a37m to customers whose holidays were cancelled owing to the pandemic, the Competition and Markets Authority has said. Complaints suggested people were not receiving refunds they were owed within 14 days, as required by law, for package holidays that were cancelled. Teletext Holidays has said it is \"extremely disappointed\" with the watchdog's actions.\nLiverpool is holding the first pilot of a live music event, with an audience of 3,000 people and no social distancing.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nigeria,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Distrust in the medical industry has led to the lower uptake of the Covid vaccine among Africans in Scotland, according to a human rights campaigner.\nMukami McCrum said \"unethical practices\" by companies in Africa left many \"scared\" to take the vaccine.\nPublic Health Scotland estimates 72% of Africans aged over 50 have had their first jab. Overall uptake is 92%.\nThe Scottish government said it was working with partners to explore the reasons for the unequal vaccine uptake.\nUptake of the Covid vaccine is lower among Africans in Scotland than any other ethnic group, according to the Public Health Scotland (PHS) figures.\nThe report looked at vaccination rates among the over-50s in six ethnic groups.\nPHS estimate there are 2,094 over-50s in Scotland who identify as African and 1,515 of those have been vaccinated.\nCovid vaccination uptake among white people is 94%. The rate is 85% for Asians and 78% for the Caribbean or Black ethnic group.\nMs McCrum, who chairs the African Women in Scotland Association, told BBC Scotland that a \"lack of information and direct engagement\" with the community from NHS Scotland was also contributing to the problem.\n\"Other communities had either centres or places to get information - or they had outreach,\" she said.\n\"Africans don't have that kind of infrastructure and therefore they are left the matter of finding out for themselves from social media - and I think you'll be aware of the confusion that there's been there about Covid and vaccines.\"\nMs McCrum said many Africans in Scotland were scared to take the vaccine because the application of medicine had \"not always been equitable\" in their countries of origin.\nThere is a history of clinical trials carried out in African countries which have raised concerns over human rights.\nOne drug trial carried out in Nigeria's northern state of Kano in 1996 by Pfizer - who manufacture one of the Covid vaccines being used in Scotland - led to the company paying compensation in an out of court settlement to some of the parents whose children took part.\nEleven children died and dozens were left disabled during a meningitis outbreak after being given an experimental antibiotic.\n\"In our living memories, there were tests done on people so people are aware of that and they recall and they wonder is this another test on us,\" Ms McCrum said.\n\"The consequence years later is that people are scared or unsure.\"\nMs McCrum said that Africans, like any other community, needed a forum to discuss their fears. \n\"More outreach work needs to be done by the NHS,\" she said.\n\"We are doing our best out of commitment and out of concern - but we don't have the gravitas or the clout to mobilise people.\" \nUptake in the African community was lowest in the 60-64 age group, with just 68% vaccinated.\nPHS said its analysis did not examine why vaccine uptake was uneven among different ethnic groups.\nHowever, the health body said they were likely to be related to factors like access to service, health literacy and \"vaccine acceptability\".\nRecent figures produced by Public Health Wales show similar inequalities between white and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups.\nUptake of the Covid vaccine in Wales for BAME people was at least 10% lower in almost every age group.\nAcross all age groups, almost 2.8 million people in Scotland have received their first dose of the vaccine, with more than one million vaccinated with both doses.\nThe Scottish government is hoping to vaccinate everyone in Scotland aged 16 or over by the end of July.\nA spokeswoman for the government said uptake so far had been \"exceptionally high\".\n\"The PHS statistics highlight differences in uptake between demographic groups, but they do not examine reasons for this which will be numerous and complex and are being explored further by the Scottish government, in conjunction with partners such as faith, third sector and community groups working alongside health boards,\" the spokeswoman added.\n\"The work of community organisations supporting minority ethnic groups is essential to ensure vaccine information is accessible and culturally appropriate - and delivered by trusted voices such as community leaders.\n\"More outreach work is planned through our inclusive approach in the coming months.\""

During a campaign visit to Greater Manchester ahead of next week's local and mayoral elections, Sir Keir popped in to the chain's Trafford Centre store.\nHe made for the furnishing, fabrics and cushions department, on the first floor, and inspected the wooden wallpaper racks.\nSir Keir read the \"wallpaper calculator\" and picked up some of the rolls - patterned and plain - at one point smiling to a photographer.\nMs Symonds has denied reports that she objected to the way the flat had been decorated by her fiance's predecessor, Theresa May - which society magazine Tatler claimed a visitor had once called a \"John Lewis furniture nightmare\".\nOn a trip to a London school, Mr Johnson joked that this was \"the one thing I object to in this whole farrago of nonsense\", adding: \"I love John Lewis.\"\nSir Keir's move appeared to anger Ms Milling, who tweeted one of the pictures, writing: \"When we say Labour are playing political games this is exactly what we mean.\n\"Today the PM visited a school to see how we are levelling-up opportunity, focusing on people's priorities. Keir Starmer is doing exactly what we said he'd do - playing politics.\"\nEarlier, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the \"general public need to know\" about the flat payments.\nPrime ministers get \u00a330,000 towards refurbishing their Downing Street accommodation. \nThe recent work carried out for Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds was by designer Lulu Lyttle - whose company says its aim is to contribute to the \"joyful atmosphere of any interior\".\nMr Johnson has said he paid the costs himself, but he has not specified whether this happened when he first received the bill, or whether he was loaned the money and later repaid it.\nThe Electoral Commission - which oversees political finances - will investigate the Conservative Party's compliance with laws on political donations, having said there are \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".\nSir Keir said the situation was becoming \"farcical\", adding that \"it would take [Mr Johnson] about one minute\" to give the details of who paid for the works, and when, \"and then he can get back on with the day job\".\nBut Mr Johnson insisted he was \"focusing on the stuff that really matters\", including \"priorities\", such as easing Covid restrictions and improving the economy.\nThe prime minister's flat is actually above 11 Downing Street, rather than No 10, because it offers more space."

      "text": "A senior judge has ruled it is lawful for carers in specific circumstances to help clients find and pay for sex. \nThe ruling found it would be wrong to stop them helping a 27-year-old man with mental disabilities fulfilling a natural desire. \nThe landmark ruling could have major implications for others.\nMinisters have been given permission to appeal the judgment because of its implications for policies on combating prostitution. \nThe Court of Protection, which made the ruling, is dedicated to taking decisions for people who lack the mental capacity to live independent and safe lives. \nThe young man at the centre of the case, known only as C, is fit and healthy but lives with carers because he needs daily help with many parts of his life. \nHe has autism and a genetic disorder - but Mr Justice Hayden said that after speaking to C, he found that he was happy and well-supported. \nThe court heard that C knew he would probably never find a girlfriend but he nevertheless wanted to experience sex - and so he had asked his carers if they could find him a sex worker who would be paid for their services. \nThat request led to a hearing at the Court of Protection because it was not clear to C's carers whether they would act illegally if they agreed to help. \nUnder England's complex prostitution laws, paying for sex is a not a crime - but actions that encourage its arrangement are. \nC's carers also feared they could be jailed for up to 10 years for inciting a vulnerable person into a sexual relationship. \nIn a landmark judgment, Mr Justice Hayden ruled that the aim of sexual offences laws was to prevent abuse, rather than stand in the way of C's request. \nIf the law banned the carers from helping C, that would be discrimination because anyone else without his condition could lawfully pay for sex. \n\"It is important to recognise that those with mental health disorders have, in the past, effectively been prevented, by the law, from engaging in sexual relations,\" said the judge. \n\"It is no longer the objective of the law to prevent people with mental disorders from having sexual relationships, rather it is to criminalise the exploitation and abuse of such adults by those with whom they are in a relationship of trust.\"\nThe judge said that a second legal question - whether a paid sexual relationship would genuinely be in C's best interests - could only be considered once a specific plan had been devised. \nLawyers for Justice Secretary Robert Buckland are now appealing the ruling. They had argued that granting permission to the carers to help C would undermine attempts to reduce prostitution by using the state's care services to facilitate it. \nBut Mr Justice Hayden said the government's objective was \"logically unsustainable\". \n\"While it is entirely understandable that [secretary of state] would not wish to be seen to act in a way which might be perceived as encouraging prostitution, the fact remains that the act is legal. \n\"The secretary of state may not obstruct those who wish to participate in lawful transactions nor, logically, those who wish to help them be they carers or otherwise.\""

      "tags": "UK banking,Companies,Barclays,Banking",
      "text": "The UK is about to experience its biggest economic boom since the aftermath of World War Two, according to Barclays boss Jes Staley.\nHis upbeat assessment came as Barclays revealed its profits for the first three months of this year had more than doubled from a year earlier to \u00a32.4bn.\n\"We estimate the UK economy will grow at its fastest rate since 1948. That's pretty spectacular,\" he said.\nThe vaccine programme and built-up savings will help to drive the rebound.\nMr Staley said that a combination of the successful vaccine rollout and Barclays' estimate of an extra \u00a3200bn sitting in customer and company bank accounts meant the UK would join the US in seeing some of the fastest economic growth in decades. \nThe boost in Barclays' latest profits was almost entirely driven by a more confident view on how many of its loans would be repaid. \nThis time last year, the bank set aside more than \u00a32bn to cover the risks that borrowers would be unable to repay all of their debts. This time round they are setting aside just \u00a355m.\nInterestingly, Barclays - unlike other big banks in the UK and US - have decided not to adjust previous estimates of bad loan previsions, but hinted that they will do so in future. \nIt will be equally interesting to watch just how much of their total \u00a39bn kitty for future estimated debt defaults they are prepared to reconsider. \nAssuming the worst regarding future defaults is sometimes called \"stuffing the cookie jar\" - a jar that can be raided when needed to boost future earnings. All banks do this to a greater or lesser degree, \nBut Mr Staley seems convinced that despite virus-related disasters in developing economies such as India and new lockdowns in developed counties such as Japan, the overall picture looks to be improving.\nHe also concedes that many business sectors (like hospitality and leisure) have faced desperately challenging circumstances and it is unclear how many of the five million workers still on furlough can expect to return to full-time work. \nThere are many business owners who will not recognise the rosy picture he paints of the UK's economic future. \nIt is probably wrong to talk in terms of an economic boom after we have seen the biggest economic downturn in 300 years, but Mr Staley is in tune with his US counterparts when he hopes and expects that, for him and his many business customers, the worst is behind us.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "About 22 million people in the UK are living in areas that have not reported any Covid-19 deaths that happened in April, according to BBC News analysis. \nBy comparison, in a four-week period during January's peak, fewer than 50,000 people lived in such places.\nThe findings were greeted as \"really good news [which] give us confidence\" by one expert.\nThe government has urged people to keep following restrictions and have the Covid vaccine when called.\nThe BBC's data analysis reveals the extent of the improvement since January's peak. \nFewer than 600 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported so far this month, compared with more than 30,000 in the first four weeks of January. \nThe figures suggest the UK's pandemic is moving into a new phase, with many areas seeing low levels of coronavirus.\nThe latest lockdown and the vaccination programme have successfully reduced cases, and as a result, deaths. \n\"This is really good news,\" said Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in the spread of infectious diseases. \"It's a really good sign and we've seen several parts of the country where prevalence is really, really low. So, I think it gives us confidence.\"\nBut he echoed another expert who urged caution.\n\"[W]e have seen before, when things go wrong they can go wrong quickly,\" said Prof Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  \nSlowly lifting restrictions means this is less likely to happen, he added.\nAreas that did not report any April deaths tended to have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases in March, the data suggests. On average, those places had 150 cases per 100,000 people in March.\nBy comparison, districts that have reported deaths in April had just under 240 positive cases per 100,000 people in March. \nSome parts have gone even longer without seeing Covid deaths. Plymouth, a major city and home to more than a quarter-of-a-million people, has not reported a Covid death in the last 58 days. In Oxford and Maidstone it's 60 days.\nBut the 19 worst-hit councils accounted for more than a third of the deaths occurring in April.\nThe areas with the highest death rates include two in Northern Ireland: Mid and East Antrim, and Antrim and Newtownabbey, as well as Sedgemoor in Somerset and Bradford, West Yorkshire. \nScientists advising the government believe that the focus in the coming months will turn to identifying and containing local and regional outbreaks.\nThere are some differences in the figures from 1-28 April across the UK.\nThese figures are based on deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive test. There is usually a delay in reporting deaths, so the official numbers for April will increase, but by this point in March, more than 90% of the month's deaths had been reported. \nThe Office for National Statistics records deaths in a different way, and under this definition more areas may have seen fatalities. \nDespite the surge in areas with zero deaths, a government spokesperson encouraged people \"to follow the rules so that our roadmap out of lockdown is irreversible\".\n\"We urge everyone to keep coming forward to get their vaccine when called. This is the best way to keep each other safe and see our roadmap through in full.\"\nIn other developments:\nAdditional research by Kristina Gray\nDo you live in an area with zero Covid deaths, or where deaths remain high?

It is open to people of all beliefs. \nThe campaign for the memorial, which is being carried out in partnership with the Daily Mail newspaper, is hoping to unite people from across the UK who are grieving the deaths of family and friends.\nMore than 127,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, government figures show.\nThe online book would sit in a new portico structure which would take a year to build.\nIt has been designed by Oliver Caroe, the cathedral's surveyor of the fabric, whose mother died of Covid-19.\nHe said it would be a \"fitting memorial\" to those who have died and would be \"part of the fabric of St Paul's and part of history for centuries to come\".\n\"There will be many families like mine who never have had an opportunity to gather; to properly acknowledge thanks for the lives lived and to appreciate carers and clinicians we will never have met,\" he said.\nThe memorial would be built on the site of an earlier porch which was destroyed by a bomb in 1941 during World War Two.\nVisitors would be able to call up entries in the online book, including a photograph of those who have died and an epitaph written by their loved ones.\nThe Very Reverend David Ison, dean of the cathedral, said: \"The physical memorial at St Paul's will anchor the online book in a place where significant events and people have been commemorated for many centuries.\"\nHe said he hoped the memorial would be a \"way of inspiring reflection, prayer or lighting a candle\".\nLondon is already home to the National Covid Memorial Wall, which consists of thousands of painted hearts on a wall opposite the Palace of Westminster."

Consideration was given to risk, opportunity, benefit.\"\nMr Styles told the inquests it was concluded that Khan should be able to join Learning Together, despite intelligence that he had been involved in radicalisation inside prison.\nHe said: \"I thought the risks presented were controllable and the potential benefits for Usman given his fairly imminent release - I thought it was a positive opportunity for Usman and for us.\"\nThe jury were shown a draft of a letter seeking an award for Learning Together's work at the prison, and Mr Styles said that although the project was no longer running at Whitemoor, its impact had been \"amazing\".\n\"It's very difficult to set aside the impact of the Fishmongers' Hall attack, but if I was able to do that I would say the feedback of everybody involved - staff, Learning Together attendees, prisoners - was absolutely outstandingly positive.\"\nKhan was considered such a success for Learning Together that he was invited to the event at Fishmongers' Hall to mark the programme's fifth anniversary.\nNick Armstrong, representing the family of Mr Merritt, 25, suggested that Learning Together had sought to use Khan as a \"poster boy\" for the programme.\n\"Learning Together had been a hugely positive experience, and it is fair to say Usman Khan had been seen as a success story - I wouldn't say a poster boy - at that point in time,\" Mr Styles replied.\nKhan armed himself with kitchen knives and killed Mr Merritt and Ms Jones, 23, and injured three others, before being chased and disarmed on nearby London Bridge by three men armed with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk.\nHe was then shot dead by police.\nThe inquests continue."

      "text": "Welsh party leaders have clashed on the Welsh government's pandemic support for businesses in a BBC election debate.\nLabour's Mark Drakeford said \u00a3200m was waiting to be spent by the next first minister after the election to give firms hit by the pandemic more help.\nBut Plaid Cymru's Adam Price questioned why it could not have been spent before the vote on 6 May.\nConservative Andrew RT Davies said there was unallocated cash in Welsh government coffers.\nAnd Jane Dodds said the Welsh Liberal Democrats would support medium, small and micro-businesses.\nMeanwhile Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party's (ATWAP) Richard Suchorzewski said firms should be given rent relief to encourage them to open up.\nThe five appeared in the BBC Wales Leaders' Debate on Thursday evening, a week before the Welsh Parliament election on 6 May.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nWelsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford told the debate his government had set aside \u00a3200m \"as a down payment to go on helping businesses straight after the election\".\n\"Whoever is in government, whichever one of us on this platform is first minister after next Thursday, there will be proposals waiting on the desk for them to spend that money to support businesses.\"\nBut Mr Price questioned why Mr Drakeford was waiting until after the election. \n\"Why wait?\" Mr Price said. \"In England and Scotland there have been restart grants of up to \u00a318,000, \u00a319,000, which will be provided to hospitality businesses and others who have had to remain closed\".\n\"It's a very simple reason, it's the rules don't allow it,\" Mr Drakeford said in response.\n\"If I was handing out cheques to businesses in Wales, Adam Price would be the first person calling foul.\"\nMr Price said that was not true, saying he called for a Senedd recall during the campaign and would have supported it.\nMr Davies said this was why he had called \"back in February for a road map out of lockdown.\n\"So those announcement could have been made outside of the election period and that money made available to businesses across Wales.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nJane Dodds said her party would support medium, small and micro-businesses, which she described as the \"backbone\" of the country. \n\"We want to freeze business rates, we want to be talking to people about what can replace those,\" she said.\n\"We want to go bigger, we want an economic development [plan] which looks at the whole of Wales, and how we can grow our economy and support small businesses\".\nLast month Plaid Cymru had called for ATWAP's Mr Suchorzewski to be dropped from the proceedings. During the debate his anti-devolution stance came under attack from his political rivals.\nMr Suchorzewski said the NHS in Wales had been \"totally mismanaged\" over the past 22 years. \nHe said that before the pandemic, five of Wales' health boards had been in special measures.  \nMr Suchorzewski said control of the NHS should be returned to the UK government: \"There should be one NHS for all - and it should be put under the guidance of the United Kingdom government.\"\nMark Drakeford was asked about why he couldn't distribute the \u00a3200m set aside for supporting businesses until after the election and he said: \"The rules don't allow it - we're in an election period.\" \nThe time before an election - in this case the period since 25 March - is known as the \"period of sensitivity\" or \"purdah\", when there are restrictions on what ministers and civil servants are allowed to do.\nThe Welsh government's guidance says that during that period, in line with the ministerial code, ministers will not make announcements that \"could be construed as conferring political advantage or electoral advantage\".\nBut the guidance also recognises that, as a result of the pandemic, ministers \"will need to continue making important decisions\" and that \"some of these decisions may inevitably be high profile and potentially sensitive\".\nSo Mr Drakeford may be taking a cautious approach to the rules, especially as he could argue that supporting businesses hit by the pandemic was not a new policy initiative but an extension of an existing policy.\nThat led Mr Drakeford to accuse the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party of \"writing off everything our people have done over the last extraordinary 12 months\".\n\"As we stand here today, Wales has the lowest rate of coronavirus anywhere in the United Kingdom and our vaccination programme is the most successful of any of the four UK nations,\" he said.\nHe admitted the UK government had done a good job in securing the supply of vaccines, but added: \"Here in Wales, we have used that supply more effectively than anywhere else.\"\nAfter Mr Suchorzewski complained about the printing of letters in English and Welsh language for Covid-19 tests, Mr Price accused him of wanting to get rid of the Welsh language: \"They don't want to abolish our parliament they want to abolish our language as well.\"\nMr Davies said: \"If the rugby team isn't playing well you don't... pull it out of the competition, you change the management structure, you change the coach and you get the team performing.\"\nAt the other side of the constitutional debate, Mr Price said now was the time to start building towards a referendum on Welsh independence.\n\"By taking our future into our own hands, that's the way that we solve our problems, the solutions will never come from Westminster.\"\nAsked how Wales would have fared alone in dealing with Covid, Mr Price accused the UK government of stealing Covid tests from Wales: \"We had tests that were ready to come to Wales, they were stolen by the UK government.\"\n\"Rubbish,\" said Mr Davies, adding Mr Price and ATWAP would cause \"constitutional chaos... slapping on the table the independence referendum, and indeed the abolish referendum that would be required to do away with the Welsh Parliament\".\nResponding to a question about the row over the refurbishment of Boris Johnson's flat, the Welsh Tory Senedd leader said: \"People aren't interested in the wallpaper in Downing Street, but they are interested in how they get an appointment at a GP's surgery\".\nHe told the debate: \"We can have a better education system, we can have a health service that responds to waiting times. We can create an economy that lifts wages across the whole of Wales and makes a difference.\"\nJane Dodds said Wales should have the same level of devolution as Scotland. \nShe said \"we don't need independence\" and instead time should be spent on creating jobs and protecting health. \nShe called on voters to \"imagine\" a better Wales. \nMs Dodds added that the Liberal Democrats wanted to \"put the climate at the heart of everything, and would  \"put recovery first\" and prioritise the economy and mental health. \nReform UK, UKIP and the Greens also took part in a three-way debate.\nFor Reform UK, Jamie Jenkins said his party was against further Covid lockdowns. \nHe claimed the majority of people now have antibodies and the successful rollout of the vaccine means restrictions are no longer necessary. \nFor UKIP, Neil Hamilton said: \"The idea that the Senedd in any way represents ordinary people in Wales is nonsense\".   \nHe said Wales was the poorest part of the UK: \"We're poorer today than 22 years ago. We've had a permanent Labour government and we're going to get a Labour government again after the sixth of May, because Plaid Cymru are already cosying up to Mark Drakeford.\"   \nAmelia Womak from the Green Party says that a vote for green jobs is a vote to \"rebuild a post pandemic Wales fit for the 21st century.\" \nAsked how she would rebuild the economy while guarding the environment, Ms Womak said that \"all of our recovery should have the environment at the heart of it, because it means jobs and opportunities it means training and education, and it means that we're tackling the biggest problems of our time.\" \nA five way debate is unlikely ever to produce an outright winner.\nBut it is very easy to come unstuck in this format - and the leaders avoided any big mistakes.\nTheir supporters will each find things to applaud and this will  have given them some added momentum going into the final week of the campaign.\nFor undecided voters the debate gave a decent flavour of what the parties are about - what does that mean for polling day? We'll find out soon.   "

      "tags": "UK air pollution,Wood,Air pollution",
      "text": "Curbs on the sale of house coal and wet wood for household burning in England have come into force under new rules aimed at cutting air pollution.\nPeople will still be able to use stoves and open fires but they will need to burn cleaner alternatives. \nThese are the first restrictions on what people can burn in their homes since the clean air acts of the 1950s. \nThe UK's air is far cleaner now, but in recent years pollution from log burners has increased dramatically. \nOnly 8% of households use them, but they are now the biggest source of the tiny pollution particles that are most damaging to health, according to government data.\nIt shows domestic wood burning in both closed stoves and open fires was responsible for 38% of pollution particles under 2.5 microns in size, three times more than road traffic.\nThese tiny particles can enter the bloodstream and lodge in lungs and other organs, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) warns, and have been identified by the World Health Organization as the most serious air pollutant for human health.\nLog burners and open fires are not being banned, but the government says people will have to buy dry wood or manufactured solid fuels which produce less smoke. \nIt says both options are just as easy to source and more efficient to burn, making them much cleaner and more cost effective.\nDefra claims burning dry wood produces more heat and less soot than wet wood and can reduce emissions by up to 50%.\nThe changes mean: \nSimilar proposals to reduce the burning of wood and coal are being considered in Wales and Scotland.\nWet - also known as green or unseasoned wood - is often sold in nets and is cheaper to buy. \nIt contains moisture which, when burned, creates more smoke and harmful particles of air pollution (PM2.5) than dry wood.\nWet wood can also damage chimneys much more, by allowing tar and soot to build up.\nDry or seasoned wood - which has been dried out, often in a kiln - has a moisture content of 20% or less.\nThis marks the latest step in the government's Clean Air Strategy, says environment minister Rebecca Pow.\n\"Burning cleaner fuels is a more efficient option for households across England, helping reduce our exposure to this incredibly harmful pollutant and benefitting the environment,\" she said.\nThe move was welcomed by Harriet Edwards, the senior air quality policy adviser for Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation. \nShe warned that air pollution is particularly harmful to people with lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\"It can put them at risk of suffering potentially life-threatening asthma attacks or flare-up,\" she said. \nOther lung experts believe that it is only a matter of time before all log burners and other fires are banned in built-up areas.\nProf Jonathan Grigg, who sits on the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution, told the BBC that unless new technologies were developed to reduce harmful air pollution from wood fires, then wood should not be burnt in areas where exposure to pollution from fossil fuel emissions is high."

They soon realised, 'we're going to have to move the walrus'.\n\"Eventually this guy came walking out with a broom, and tried to usher him off the ramp.\n\"Then [the walrus] looked at him as if to say, 'you're having a laugh'. He's the size of a cow. He wouldn't move.\"\nWith no luck with the brush, Mr Sidwell said the crew member tried a different approach.\n\"Then he came back with an air-horn. He must have thought, 'I've had enough of this noise', and turned into the sea,\" he recalled.\nThe RNLI said the lifeboat was responding to two canoeists who got into difficulty between Stackpole and Broadhaven, about 10 miles west of Tenby.\nSince Wally's arrival, the crew has learned that \"making a bit of noise\" can encourage the walrus off the slipway while the lifeboat is launched, the charity said.\n\"On Monday the walrus needed a bit more convincing to move from the slip,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"Due to the severity of the call-out and the need to keep the RNLI volunteers at a safe distance, a louder noise was made.\n\"Again, once the lifeboat was on the water, Wally soon returned to his sunbathing spot and carried on with his day.\"\nReflecting on the experience, Mr Sidwell, who travelled home on Wednesday, said he felt privileged because seeing such animals in the flesh was \"extremely rare\".\n\"It was a little bit tinged with sadness - he's a long way from home. But he's healthy and putting on weight since he first turned up,\" he added.\n\"Obviously the local razor clams have fed him up quite well.\""

I am surrounded by ladies.\"\nMr Tindall, who is a patron of Cure Parkinson's, also spoke about his 74-year-old father, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2003.\nHe said, growing up, his father had been the \"guy who taught me how to play rugby, he was the guy who was endlessly in the back garden doing whatever sport we wanted to do\".\nHe added: \"He was just that active guy who loved playing sport and teaching his two boys how to play sport.\"\nBut since he was diagnosed, Mr Tindall said his father's condition has \"got worse\", and managing it had become a \"real uphill battle\".\nHe revealed it had also been difficult for his mother Linda, who has become his father's main carer, adding that both his parents had faced isolation due to coronavirus.\n\"You're not really going out...the Parkinson's nurses have had to be re-used elsewhere with the pandemic that has been going on, so it's been really hard for them to speak to people. It's been tough on them.\"\nOn Friday, Buckingham Palace released a video conversation between Mr Tindall and the Duchess of Gloucester - who is the patron of Parkinson's UK - to mark World Parkinson's Day.\nDuring their conversation, which took place on 7 April, Mr Tindall paid tribute to his mother, as a \"very stoic, northern lady, who refuses to give her man up\", but said he is trying to convince her to accept offers of support.\nHe said both his parents were on the vulnerable list and had not left their home for a year.\n\"What they've really missed out of this year is... my mum's missed companionship, really - being able to go and see someone else, because she doesn't feel now that she's comfortable leaving my dad alone.\"\nMr Tindall said his father had endured a \"tough five years\", but that the worsening of his condition went back 10 years to 2011 - the year he married Princess Anne's daughter."

      "text": "A team of Polish scientists say they have discovered the only known example of an embalmed pregnant Egyptian mummy.\nThe discovery was made by researchers at the Warsaw Mummy Project and revealed in the Journal of Archaeological Science on Thursday.\nThe project, started in 2015, uses technology to examine artefacts housed at the National Museum in Warsaw. \nThe mummy was previously thought to be a male priest but scans reveal it was a woman in the later stages of pregnancy. \nExperts from the project believe the remains are most likely of a high-status woman, aged between 20 and 30, who died during the 1st Century BC.  \n\"Presented here is the only known example of a mummified pregnant woman and the first radiological images of such a foetus,\" they wrote in the journal article announcing the find. \nUsing the foetus head circumference, they estimate it was between 26 and 30 weeks when the mother died for unknown reasons.\n\"This is our most important and most significant finding so far, a total surprise,\" team member Wojciech Ejsmond of the Polish Academy of Sciences told the Associated Press. \nFour bundles, thought to be wrapped and embalmed organs, were found within the mummy's abdominal cavity but scientists say the foetus had not been removed from the uterus. \nThe scientists said it was unclear why it had not been extracted and embalmed separately, but speculated spiritual beliefs about the afterlife or physical difficulties with removal may have contributed.\nResearchers from the mummy project have dubbed the woman as the Mysterious Lady of the National Museum in Warsaw because of conflicting accounts around her origins. \nThey say the mummified remains were first donated to the University of Warsaw in 1826. The donor alleged the mummy was found in royal tombs in Thebes, but researchers say it was common in the 19th century to falsely ascribe antiquities to famous places to increase their value.\nInscriptions on the elaborate coffin and sarcophagus had led 20th Century experts to believe the mummy inside was that of a male priest named Hor-Djehuti. \nBut now scientists, having identified it as female with scanning technology, believe the mummy was at some point placed in the wrong coffin by antiquity dealers during the 19th Century, when looting and re-wrapping of remains were not uncommon. \nThey describe the condition of the mummy as \"well-preserved\" but say damage to the neck wrappings suggest it was at some point targeted for valuables.\nThe experts say at least 15 items, including a \"rich set\" of mummy-shaped amulets, were found in tact within the wrappings. \nOne of the researchers on the project, Dr Marzena O\u017carek-Szilke, told the Polish state news agency that her husband had first spotted what appeared to be \"a little foot\" on one of the scans.\nShe told the outlet that the team hope next to study small amounts of tissue to establish the woman's cause of death.

Now it's clear they intend to act on it.\nHowever, it will come as a surprise that one of those being asked to think about her future is Martina Anderson - she has been a Sinn F\u00e9in stalwart for decades and was the party's voice in Brussels for years.\nBut party loyalty may not be not enough as Sinn F\u00e9in begins devising its strategies ahead of the next assembly election, in a bid to win back some ground. \nBoth Ms Anderson and Ms Mullan were co-opted into the Stormont Assembly.\nMs Anderson, who stepped down from her MEP role in 2020, replaced Raymond McCartney in March that year.\nPreviously, Ms Anderson served as an MLA for Foyle from 2007 to 2012.\nKaren Mullan replaced Elisha McCallion as a Foyle MLA in June 2017 following Mrs McCallion's election as an MP for Foyle."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All but one Scottish council have now met a key benchmark for the further easing of Covid restrictions.\nEarlier this week every local authority briefly averaged fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 population, one of the requirements for a move to level two.\nBut a surge of cases in Moray has taken it back above the threshold for easing restrictions even further.\nThe next target date for relaxing Covid restrictions across the whole of Scotland is 17 May.\nA move to level two would allow limited numbers of people to socialise indoors, permit pubs to serve alcohol inside and see an easing of restrictions on theatres and cinemas.\nOn Monday every council had a seven-day average case rate of fewer than 50 cases per 100,000, according to latest data from Public Health Scotland (PHS). \nA day later, however, Moray's figure rose to 50.1 for the week to 27 April. The test positivity rate uses data from three days ago to present a more accurate picture of the trend.\nSixteen new cases were confirmed on Friday in the council area, which has 95,000 people, meaning the figure looks set to rise higher in the coming days. \nDr Jillian Evans, an expert in public health from NHS Grampian, told BBC Scotland that Moray was causing concern because the rise in cases could not be linked to a specific event or place.\n\"That gives us cause for concern because it makes it difficult for us to manage those individual cases,\" she said. \nDr Evans said the contact tracing in Moray was now going back much further than the infectious period to try to identify the source of the infection.\n\"That reminds me of what is happening in places like New Zealand where they really looking at this with an individual lens and not just a population one,\" Dr Evans said.\n\"We can only do that because infection rates generally across Grampian and Scotland are so low.\"\nNorth Lanarkshire, which had a case rate above 50 until two days ago, is now at 43.6 cases per 100,000, according to the PHS data.\nUnder the Scottish government's strategic framework, achieving a seven day case rate of under 50 is a key measure for considering whether an area should move to level two - although other factors are considered such as the ability of the NHS to cope. \nFifteen local authorities are currently seeing fewer than 20 cases per week per 100,000 - the threshold for a move to level one. \nMidlothian, the Western Isles and Shetland had no cases in the seven days to 27 April. \nAnother encouraging measure is the weekly rate for test positivity across the country which now stands at 1.2%, down from 15% at the start of this year. \nOn two days this week the rate dropped below 1%, the first time this has happened since September when it began to rise after the summer lull.\nProf Linda Bauld, a public health expert at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland's Drive programme she was \"very confident\" Scotland was on track to move to level two when the next review takes place in a couple of weeks.\nShe said she thought the overall numbers were going to continue to decline but it needed the vaccine rollout to continue at pace, people to remain careful and for test and protect to \"get on top of\" outbreaks.\nThe declining number of Covid cases has translated into far fewer people in hospital, with the numbers again similar to those in September last year.\nThere were just 67 people in hospital on Thursday and nine in intensive care with recently-confirmed Covid.\nThat compares with more than 2,000 in hospital at the end of January and 150 in intensive care.\nThe latest report from the UK's Office for National Statistics shows that Scotland still has the highest rate of people testing positive for Covid.\nIn England the rate was one in 1,010 people, in Wales it was one in 1,570, in Northern Ireland one in 940 and in Scotland one in 640.\nThe Scottish government's latest weekly assessment of the epidemic cited a major study published in the Lancet on how vaccination was reducing hospital admissions. \nIt said that four weeks after receiving a first dose, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of Covid hospitalisation by 91%  and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine by 88%.\nAbout 2.8 million people in Scotland have had the first dose of a vaccine, 62% of the population aged over 16.\nThe modelling report said the reproduction rate R in Scotland is currently estimated as being between 0.8 and 1.0 - slightly higher than last week."

It's thought access to better testing, targeted publicity campaigns and new ways of reducing risk at work may have all played a part.\nBut the data shows that those from the Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi community were still significantly more likely to get sick, end up in hospital and die compared with those who self-reported as white.\nThe authors of the research said medical factors including weight, blood pressure and other underlying health conditions played the biggest role in explaining the increased risk in South Asian groups.\nAccording to the most recent 2011 census, 21% of South Asian groups live in multigenerational households, compared with about 7% of white groups. \nThe report said greater household size was also an important factor in explaining the increased death rate.\n\"In general, living in multigenerational households and highly networked communities is of huge social benefit,\" said Dr Mathur at LSHTM. \n\"But with infectious diseases it may also increase risk of exposure to the infection from younger or working age adults who may bring the virus into the household and may potentially put older members at risk.\"\nBased on their findings, the researchers are calling for more support to tackle what they call the structural racism faced by some communities. They said improved access to healthcare could increase the uptake of both testing and vaccination in the future."

The White House has said it will donate 15 million N95 masks in total.\nJeremy Konyndyk, the executive director of the Covid task force at the US Agency for International Development, told AFP news agency that their first priority was to address India's most \"immediate needs\". \nThe UK also donated ventilators to India earlier this week.\nHowever, many experts in India say more is needed. On Tuesday, Mumbai-based Dr Zarir Udwadia told the BBC that the aid being offered was \"a drop in an ocean\".\nOn Saturday, all adults above the age of 18 in India will become eligible for vaccination, but there are widespread concerns about the availability of shots. India is the world's biggest producer of vaccines but does not have enough stock for the estimated 800 million people who will become eligible. \nSo far, fewer than 10% of people in India have had a Covid vaccination.\nA number of states are reporting shortages of the vaccine. On Thursday, Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain said the capital had run out of doses, and that they were waiting for fresh supplies from private companies.\nIndia's financial capital, Mumbai, home to more than 20 million people, has suspended its vaccination drive for three days due to \"depletion of available vaccines\", the local authority said in a statement. \nThe municipal commissioner of Mumbai, Ashwini Bhide, said on Twitter that the city would reserve current stocks for people aged over 45 years old.\nThis could lead to another crisis. On 1 May, another 40 million people will already be in the queue for their second dose. For the vaccines being administered in India, it is currently recommended that people get their second dose four to eight weeks after the first."

His application to the Met is made in the summer, only days after he had attended an NS131 event\n2018 - Enrols with Met Police and is passed out in front of Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick the following year\n2020 - Arrested by police and subsequently charged\nJudge Leonard told Hannam that he had \"no doubt that your autism played a part in your offending\".\nHe said that, in committing fraud, the defendant had \"abused the trust\" of the police and public.\n\"You have harmed public trust in the police by your deceit,\" he said.\nThe prosecution could not say that Hannam was preparing to make explosives or employ the knife-fighting techniques.\nHannam pleaded guilty to one count of possessing prohibited images of children, details of which were read out during the sentencing.\nWhen his home was searched by detectives last year, his computer was found to contain a folder of \"anime cartoons\" of children and young people Hannam had downloaded.\nProsecutor Dan Pawson-Pounds said: \"Although most of the files in this folder did not show any sexual acts, there was a series of 12 drawings of the same hand-drawn girl, who appeared to be eight or nine years old, engaged in acts of intercourse.\"\nMr Pawson-Pounds said that aggravating features in relation to the prohibited images included the age of the child depicted, and the fact she looked distressed in some images and was wearing a school uniform.\nJurors were told Hannam had remained part of a successor version of NA, called NS131, after the original group was banned in December 2016.\nHe later lied to police about his far-right past on his Met application form.\nDuring a police training session on extremism, Hannam was actually shown videos relating to NA and one of his associates, a senior member of the group called Mark Jones, the trial heard.\nHannam was arrested last March after being identified through a database relating to a neo-Nazi web forum was leaked online by anti-fascists.\nIn his bedroom, officers found an NA business card and badges, as well as writings about his involvement with the group.\nOn the day the organisation was banned in December 2016, Hannam had transferred the knife-fighting manual from his computer to folder named \"NA\" on a memory stick.\nIn mitigation, Ailsa Williamson said her client had \"matured\" since his involvement with NA and that he had taken a different path by joining the police and a church.\nMs Williamson read a character statement from a member of the Mormon church Hannam joined.\nShe asked for a reduction in Hannam's sentence due to his autism diagnosis.\nFollowing the hearing, advocacy group Hope not Hate welcomed Hannam's jail sentence.\nA spokesman said: \"He hid his extremist, violent politics and served as a police officer while a member of an organisation that plotted white supremacist terror. \n\"The authorities must learn lessons from the Ben Hannam case. \nVetting procedures failed because they were out-dated and weak.\"\nThe Met's Cdr Richard Smith described Hannam's offending as \"unique\".\nHe said the former PC had \"joined and engaged with a right-wing terrorism organisation, whose views are the antithesis of police values. \n\"He then lied about his past links to this group when applying to become a police officer\" but \"his past caught up with him,\" he said. \n\"This case illustrates the real and immediate risk posed by hate-filled ideologies and those who promote them online and elsewhere,\" Cdr Smith added. \nOne of the country's most senior counter-terrorism officers defended the force's vetting procedures, while admitting they are being looked at.\nThe Met's Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, who is the National Police Chiefs Council's counter-terrorism lead, told Times Radio it would be \"foolish\" for him to say vetting procedures were not being reviewed nationally because of the case.\nHe said: \"No vetting process is 100%, the judge recognised the vetting process wasn't to blame here, in this particular case.\n\"There has to be a balance, there's both resource and people's privacy to consider and if people thought that the might of the UK intelligence community and counter-terrorism policing were going to look at every single aspect of your life because you applied, I think that would have a rather chilling effect on joining the police\"."

      "text": "UK clubbers have returned to the dance floor for the first time since the pandemic began, as part of trials to see how venues can reopen.\nSome 6,000 partygoers are expected at a warehouse in Liverpool across a two-day event that started on Friday.\nTicket-holders don't need to socially distance or wear face coverings, but they'll need a negative Covid test result before being allowed in.\nLiverpool is also set to host the UK's first restriction-free gig since Covid.\nCircus's The First Dance club nights, which are part of a series of government trials on crowd safety during Covid, are at the Bramley-Moore Dock warehouse.\nSven V\u00e4th, the Blessed Madonna and Jayda G are all performing on Friday night. Fatboy Slim is headlining on Saturday.\nCoronavirus has crippled the nightclub industry, with a recent report finding UK clubs have been forced to make 51% of their staff redundant since last year. In comparison, bars and pubs have axed 32% and 25% of their workers respectively.\nClubs will have been closed for 15 months by June, when it is hoped all legal restrictions on social contact will be lifted in England.\nScientists are using this weekend's event to look at whether crowds mixing and dancing indoors increases transmission of the virus. \nPublic health expert Prof Iain Buchan, who is leading the research, tells Newsbeat his team will use carbon dioxide monitors to detect \"pockets of stale air\" in the venue.\nThere will be also be small cameras for the scientists to monitor people's movements.\nProf Buchan says a key question the trial event needs to answer is: \"With all of those measures in place, do people still enjoy themselves?\"\n\"That's a really important part of making these events sustainable,\" he says.\nThose attending the club nights must have a negative Covid test result from a lateral flow test within 24 hours of the start of the event.\nThe test cannot be done at home but instead must be carried out at a local testing centre. This is because the government wants to look at the role these centres could play as big events return. \nPartygoers will also be encouraged to take a PCR test five days after their night out, to make sure any spread of the virus is properly monitored. \nOnly those living in the Liverpool City Region and showing no sign of Covid symptoms were eligible to apply for tickets. \nJade Edwards is one of those with a ticket. The 28-year-old barista from Liverpool tells Newsbeat she feels \"emotional\" that her hometown has been given the opportunity to host a trial event.\nJade says it's been two years since she properly went clubbing. \n\"I'm excited to see Yousef... it's going to be one to remember,\" she adds.\nSport has already been trialling the return of crowds, with events including the World Snooker Championship and the FA Cup. \nLiverpool has been at the forefront of the government's trials on crowd safety - on Sunday, Blossoms will be among the bands to perform to a crowd of 5,000 fans at an outdoor gig at Sefton Park.\nThe site can usually host 7,500 people. \nAs with the club nights, lateral flow tests will be required beforehand but social distancing and face coverings won't be needed once people arrive. \nThe gig is being hosted by Festival Republic, which is also behind Reading and Leeds Festival.\nMelvin Benn, Festival Republic's managing director, doesn't believe the event carries a public health risk. \n\"If there had been concern the event would produce a spike, the public health director in Liverpool would have suggested to us that it wasn't a good idea to go ahead,\" he says.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "text": "A serial sex attacker who assaulted 10 women and two girls in just two days in Swansea has been sent to prison. \nOliver Smith, 27, carried out his attacks for \"political\" reasons as he didn't believe women \"should wear enticing clothes in public.\"\nSmith, of Swansea, mainly targeted his victims in Singleton Park, and Brynmill Park in Swansea on 12 and 13 February, the city's crown court heard.\nHe was jailed for three years having earlier admitted 13 charges.\nSmith, of Uplands in the city, was also given a sexual harm prevention order and placed on the sex offenders register for the rest of his life.\nMany of his victims have been left scared to go out alone since the attack, the court heard.\nSmith had attacked them while riding his bike around Singleton Park, Brynmill Park, Sketty Lane, as well as between Blackpill and Singleton, Bishopston and Kittle.\nAt a previous hearing before magistrates, he admitted sexually assaulting a girl under 13, attempted sexual assault and 10 further charges of sexually assault, with one victim assaulted twice.\nHe also asked for seven other offences of sexual assault by touching to be taken into account for sentencing.\nBefore Smith was sentenced, three victim impact statements were read to the court.\n\"Immediately after the assault, I felt vulnerable in a way that I hadn't known possible,\" one victim said. \n\"I burst into tears. I was completely overwhelmed by fear and had to walk home whilst constantly glancing around. I've terrified that he would appear and assault me again. \n\"I was a regular runner, but after the attack I couldn't bring myself to leave the house for fear of encountering him again. I've had nightmares and I've had to seek out professional help from victim support to deal with the impact of the assault.\" \nIn a second statement, another victim said she felt scared and upset that someone would carry out such an attack.\n\"I've spent countless days too scared to lie down during the nights because I've been worried that someone was going to break in,\" she said.\n\"I was a mess, hysterically crying and shaking, and wondered if I'd ever feel safe to go out again.\n\"I've been worried and anxious about walking through the park, even when I'm with someone I've not been there very much since., but when I have I was constantly checking behind me and become paranoid that someone was behind me. \n\"This man took away the only freedom I had in lockdown. Walking and exercise was the only thing that's kept me happy in lockdown. So I felt he had stolen this from me.\"\nPsychiatric reports on Smith showed he has \"very bizarre ideas, ideology and thinking\", the court heard.\nJudge Geraint Walters was also told that for 15 years, his mother has had concerns about her son's \"bizarre views\" and \"conspiracy theories\" and had been trying to seek a proper diagnosis for his condition.\nBut the hearing was told Smith had refused to engage with mental health support services to get an autism assessment done. \nAs he sentenced him, Judge Walters said the attacks \"caused widespread terror at the time to women in and around the Swansea area\".\n\"Many speak of the sense of violation of your having assaulted them in that way,\" he told Smith.\n\"Some have described profound effects which continue to this day.\n\"You were wearing a hoodie and dark clothing with a hood over your head, using a bicycle to cycle up to your victims and then make a quick getaway.\""

      "tags": "Jair Bolsonaro,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of deaths related to Covid-19 has passed 400,000 in Brazil, the second-highest in the world, as the country continues to struggle with its vaccination programme.\nThere were 3,001 deaths in 24 hours, after a peak of more than 4,000 was reached at the start of April.\nThe 14-day average of deaths and cases remains high but has seen a slight fall.\nCongress has opened an inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who has frequently spoken out against lockdowns, masks and defended unproved drugs as treatment, is facing widespread criticism and his support has plummeted.\nThe outbreak has been fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus and a lack of co-ordinated national measures. The situation has improved in many areas, including where the health system was on the brink of collapse, after states and cities imposed restrictions, but they are already being eased.\nThe rate of occupancy of intensive care unit beds remains at or above 90% in more than a third of the states, according to the health institute Fiocruz, which said the scenario remained \"critical\".\n\"[There's] a tendency of a slight fall but not yet of containment of the epidemic,\" the institute said in a report (in Portuguese), warning that the daily number of deaths is likely to remain high.\nBrazil recorded 100,000 deaths in just 37 days, between March and April, which were the worst months in the country. Only the US has a higher death toll.\nSince the start of the pandemic, Brazil has had more than 14.5 million cases.\nMeanwhile, some cities have had to temporarily halt their vaccination programmes amid a shortage of doses. About 13% of the population of 212 million has received at least one dose, according to the Our World in Data tracker.\nBy Mark Lowen, BBC News, S\u00e3o Paulo\nIt is a horrific toll that Brazil may not have reached if vaccines had been bought more quickly and lockdowns imposed. But President Bolsonaro has been reluctant to act - and Brazil is now mourning more than 400,000 dead. \nOnly around 13% of Brazilians have received one vaccine dose and 6% both shots: slow procurement is one of the issues a senate inquiry will now examine, since the government turned down offers of tens of millions of shots from Pfizer last year. The parliamentary commission could recommend the president's impeachment or even criminal charges.\nMr Bolsonaro has been bullish as ever, threatening to send in the army to stop states locking down. And his supporters claim the government could not have purchased vaccine doses sooner, since it was waiting for approval from Brazil's health regulator.\nThe pandemic has fed Brazil's deep political polarisation. Mr Bolsonaro is playing to his conservative support base - but polls show it is shrinking as Brazil continues to count its dead.\nOn Tuesday, a Senate commission started an official inquiry into the Bolsonaro government's response to Covid-19. They have the power to demand documents and call on witnesses to testify, and the findings can be submitted to authorities with the ability to prosecute.\nThe commission will investigate a number of actions, including slow vaccine procurement by the president, his repeated statements downplaying the severity of the virus, and the promotion of scientifically unproven drugs such as hydroxychloroquine.\nIt will also analyse whether the government was negligent in the oxygen crisis in Amazonas state, which was ravaged by a more infectious variant earlier this year, and if indigenous communities in the Amazon were left without assistance, in what critics have described as possible genocide.\nThe inquiry could add to calls for impeachment of the president, though analysts say that is unlikely to happen. But the proceedings and possible revelations can cause serious damage to President Bolsonaro, who is almost certain to run for re-election next year, when his main rival could be former leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\nPresident Bolsonaro said he was \"not worried\" by the inquiry. Since the start of the pandemic, he has opposed any lockdown measures arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, a position shared by many of his supporters.\nIn a separate development, the Russian developer of the Sputnik V vaccine has said it will sue Brazil's health regulator Anvisa for defamation in a row over the product.\nAnvisa has denied state requests to approve the vaccine for import, and raised concerns about the make up of Sputnik V. At a press conference on Thursday, officials from the regulator condemned the Russian developer's \"grave accusation\". "

      "text": "Families in Israel have begun burying their loved ones after at least 45 people died in a crush at a crowded Jewish festival overnight.\nSome 150 people were also injured at the Lag B'Omer festival, near Mount Meron, when people became trapped in an overcrowded passageway.   \nFunerals were allowed to take place for victims who were positively identified.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised that an inquiry would ensure such a tragedy did not happen again.\nVisiting the scene, he said it was one of the worst peacetime disasters the country had known.\nOne survivor who gave his name as David told Ynet news it had felt like a human wave had broken: \"Our bodies were swept along by themselves. People were thrown up in the air - others were crushed on the ground.\" \nMedics struggled to reach the injured in the ensuing chaos.\nThose who died are believed to be predominantly men or boys from the ultra-Orthodox community as the crush at the largely gender-segregated event apparently happened in one of the men's sections.\nSome victims are believed to be foreign nationals. Israeli airline El Al has offered to assist family members of victims living abroad who wish to attend their loved ones' funerals in Israel.\nSunday has been declared a national day of mourning. \nBodies of the dead were taken to the Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, which had identified 32 before the process was halted for 24 hours on Friday evening for observance of the Sabbath.\nOne of the first funerals to be reported was that of Rabbi Elazar Goldberg, who was in his late thirties.\nMourners in Jerusalem prayed, some wept, as the body covered in a white sheet was moved into the back of a vehicle ahead of burial, Reuters news agency reports.\nTwo of the youngest victims were brothers Moshe Natan Englander, 14, and Yehoshua Englander, 9, from Jerusalem.\nAt least two of the dead are US citizens from New York, Congressman Mondaire Jones confirmed in a tweet.\nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin lit 45 candles on Friday afternoon to commemorate the dead, the Jerusalem Post reports.\n\"This is the time to hug the families and to help them find their loved ones - to cry together,\" he said. \"This is a hard and painful day. This tragedy is heartbreaking.\" \nThe site includes several large gathering grounds with open-air stands and stages, connected by a network of paths. It was along one of those paths where witnesses said the crush of people began at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday). \nSome witnesses said the incident had begun when police closed the passageway, said to be 3m (10ft) wide. Police sources told Haaretz newspaper some people had slipped on steps, causing dozens more to fall over. This was not officially confirmed.\nAn injured man lying on a hospital bed said a line of people in the front of the surging crowd had simply collapsed.\n\"A pyramid of one on top of another was formed,\" the unnamed man was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. \"People were piling up one on top of the other. I was in the second row. The people in the first row - I saw people die in front of my eyes.\"\nDov Maisel, director of operations for volunteer-based emergency services organisation United Hatzalah, told the BBC he had never witnessed such a scene in his 30-year career.\n\"It felt like a surreal scene where we had over 20 people undergoing CPR by our teams, with limited ability to evacuate from the scene, simply because the place was too overwhelmed with people,\" he said.\nWitnesses say a police barricade prevented people from leaving the crowded area.\nIsrael's state watchdog, the State Comptroller's office, issued warnings in 2008 and 2011 of the risk of a disaster.\nSpecial danger was posed by access roads and paths which \"are narrow and not appropriate to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the site\", the office was quoted as saying by the New York Times.\nWhat was different this year was that bonfire areas were partitioned off as a Covid-19 precaution and this may have created unexpected choke-points for foot traffic, Reuters reports, quoting Israeli media.\nThousands of police officers closed down the event after the crush before helping evacuate attendees.\nInvestigators will look into whether there was any police misconduct, the justice ministry said. \nMr Netanyahu promised a \"serious\" investigation that \"would ensure this kind of disaster never happens again\".\nRegional police chief Shimon Lavi told reporters at the scene he took upon himself \"the overall responsibility, for good and for bad\" and was \"ready for every inspection\". \nHe later told AFP news agency his officers had done all they could on a \"tragic night\". Other police officials told local media people had slipped in the walkway and the crush had been \"out of their control\".\nAn unnamed police source told Haaretz the incident could not have been prevented and the police were not to blame.\nUS President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Netanyahu to offer his condolences. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with \"the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy\" and German Chancellor Angela and offered her \"heartfelt sympathies\".\nAt the disaster site, men come in their dozens. Some pray. Others stand in groups, exchange short words and point to where tragedy unfolded.\nI walk down the ramp from the top of the slope where the crowd swelled. It is made of metal, with no steps, and eyewitness say it was wet and slippery.\nThen the narrow passageway turns hard to the right and there are steep steps. One man points down them. \"The police, they put barriers there!\" he says, anger rising in his voice. \nPeople say they could not get out as the crowd at the top, unaware, carried on coming.\nJewish pilgrims travel here in their hundreds of thousands for blessings at the shrine of a rabbi from antiquity. Instead, this year they met panic and a deadly crush. \nAnd now this holy site witnesses an unplanned, mass evacuation. The festival was cancelled, and people are being bused out in their tens of thousands.\nWere you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

      "text": "The US space agency has announced it is extending its Mars helicopter mission.\nNasa said the first three flights of the drone, called Ingenuity, had worked so well it would now be moving from a demonstration to an operational phase.\nThis means the chopper will support Nasa\u2019s Perseverance Rover, helping with its hunt for signs of life.\nThe new phase will last for another 30 Martian days - or Sols - but the team said it was hopeful the operational role could be extended further.\n\u201cThe technical performance has been fantastic and it is exceeding all our expectations,\u201d said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity\u2019s project manager. \n\u201cI can't tell you how excited we are about this new phase.\u201d\nIngenuity\u2019s flight on 19 April made history as the first powered, controlled flight on another planet. \nThe 1.8kg chopper lifted off in the extremely thin Martian atmosphere and hovered at a height of 2m for about 40 seconds before landing.\nFor its second and third flights, it flew further afield, rising to a height of 5m before speeding off laterally for 2m and 50m before returning to its landing spot.\nNasa\u2019s original plan was to then carry out two more flights, before grounding Ingenuity to bring the technology demonstration to a close.\nBut Friday's announcement is a change of course. The US space agency said it was so pleased with the helicopter\u2019s performance, it wanted to explore Ingenuity's capabilities in a new way.\nBob Balaram, Ingenuity\u2019s chief engineer, said: \u201cIt's been riding the winds, it's been taking off great, all the engineering systems, the solar panel, the battery, the radio have all been working very well - everything has just been fantastic.\"\nNow, Ingenuity will be helping out with the rover's science programme.\nIt will work with the Perseverance robot as it starts to investigate Jezero Crater, a region of Mars that was once a lake. \nThe rover will be looking for rock samples that it can study with its onboard instruments and tools. Its ultimate aim is to find signs of life.\nIn the helicopter's new operational phase, it will fly up to a kilometre ahead of the rover, scouting for promising geological features and exploring areas that Perseverance cannot reach.\nIt will also make digital elevation maps, helping scientists to better understand the terrain.\nThe hope is this will demonstrate how aerial mobility could help future missions.\nThe helicopter's fourth flight, which took place on Friday, begins the transition to the operational phase.\nThe plan was a 266m-round trip and for the helicopter to take 60 black-and-white images and five colour images, and Nasa has confirmed the helicopter flew further and faster than ever before.\nThis data will help the team to locate a new flight field, and on its next flight, in about a week's time, the helicopter will head there so the next stage of its mission can begin.\nNasa is hopeful the helicopter will perform well, but acknowledges the next phase will push the helicopter to its limits - it was only ever built to fly as a tech demo.\n\"We will now be flying over unsurveyed terrains and transfer to airfields that are not well characterised so there's a higher probability of a bad landing,\" explained MiMi Aung. \n\"We will be celebrating each day that ingenuity survives and operates beyond the original window.\"\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter.."

There are definitely queues.\nOn our walk through the area our cameraman and I stopped to talk to those who had managed to secure a table.\nThey were in great spirits - delighted to be back in Belfast with a pint and friends, something they felt they had missed and deserved after what has felt like a long year.\nThe queues didn't move much while we were there but there was an air of excitement back in the city on this chilly Friday evening.\nChris Nelmes, the manager of the Boulevard shopping centre in Banbridge, County Down, said there had been an \"encouraging start\" to business.\n\"There's been queues since well before the shops have opened,\" he said.\n\"\"It feels a bit like Christmas Day today and with it being a bank holiday weekend it will be very, very busy.\"\nFor retail staff there was an \"excitement, a buzz to get back into store, back into what we do best\", said shop manager Laura Mawhinney.\n\"It definitely feels busier than our previous reopening last June,\" she said.\n\"This year customers have a level of expectation - they're a lot more confident, they know what the rules are this time, they know what to expect in their shopping.\n\"The mood just seems great, I think everyone's just excited.\"\nThere was almost a party atmosphere in the centre of Belfast on Friday.\nThe sun was shining, the buskers were back and people were keen to shop.\nPrimark, which famously doesn't sell online, was particularly busy and its queues were well marshalled.\n\"People are glad to get out - it's been a long four months,\" one of those Primark shoppers told me.\nIn Portrush, County Antrim, Camilla Long from the Causeway Chamber of Commerce described an \"amazing sense of optimism\" in the town. \n\"I was walking around here last night and there were trucks delivering, windows being washed, doors open for the first time in 18 weeks,\" she said.\n\"People [were] getting ready to do what we do best in the north coast and that's to welcome visitors back.\"\nBut she also said it was important to acknowledge people whose businesses had collapsed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"For each and every business owner and family who relies on that business, that is a tragedy.\"\nAdrian Walker of GLL, which runs Belfast City Council's gyms and leisure centres, said that he expected May to be a busy month.\n\"People are really keen to get back and get back into some form of exercise,\" he said.\nThe \"trickle-flow programme\" the leisure centres had implemented meant there was reduced capacity at gyms, he said, but that allowed people more time to use different machines.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann has warned the hospitality industry not to seek or promote cross-border business while there is a big difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the proportion of people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine.\nOn Thursday the Irish government announced a phased relaxation of its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown rules over the coming weeks and months.\nFrom 10 May, people can travel outside their county and close contact services and click-and-collect retail can resume.\nThe Stormont executive's advice remains that people in Northern Ireland should \"stay local\".\nMinisters have given an indicative date of 24 May for hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland to be allowed to resume trading indoors but that will have to be assessed on 13 May, the next review of the coronavirus restrictions.\nThe executive has also earmarked 24 May for the reopening of tourist accommodation such as hotels and bed-and-breakfasts.\nThere had been some confusion about the implementation of Covid-19 regulations for outdoor hospitality venues in the run-up to Friday.\nSome venues have been told they could not reopen because their outdoor seating areas did not adhere to regulations from the executive.\nOn Thursday the industry body Hospitality Ulster said the majority of hospitality businesses had failed last-minute inspections.\nThe Department of Health had said the general rule of thumb was that outdoor premises should not be more than 50% enclosed.\nThe legislation states that a premises is substantially enclosed if it has a ceiling or roof but there is \"an opening in the walls\".\nResponsibility for enforcing the regulations on outdoor areas rests with the 11 councils in Northern Ireland.\nSean McLaughlin, who owns a fish and chip restaurant in Portrush, was frustrated that the outdoor area he had invested in was deemed unsuitable on Thursday.\nHe was told that its because its partial coverage did not comply with the rules.\n\"There's more than adequate ventilation to sit there as one family but you can go to big stores today and brush hands with people and there's nothing,\" he said.\n\"We've put this in and we're left stuck with it.\n\"Restaurateurs who are using the exact same space that they used last year are now being told they can't use it - it's nonsensical.\"\nMany bars that are only licensed to sell alcohol indoors but had thought that if they provided a safe outdoor area they would be permitted to open.\nThis week three bars in Belleek, County Fermanagh, which had planned to reopen were contacted by the police who said they would not be allowed to trade.\nBridie Gormley, the owner of Black Cat Cove, said it was another blow for a \"small rural town that has suffered terribly during Covid\".\n\"On Monday we found out that our outdoor area is not licensed for outdoor serving,\" she said.\n\"We had spent thousands of pounds on outdoor furniture, we bought in our stock and we had given our staff a starting date.\n\"Now all of that has had to be cancelled.\""

      "text": "The Co-op has become the latest supermarket chain to say it will stop selling plastic \"bags for life\".\nThe retailer, which has 2,600 shops, said many people only used the 10p bags once before throwing them away. \nThe Co-op said its move would take 29.5 million bags for life, or about 870 tonnes of plastic, out of circulation every year.   \nEarlier this month, Morrisons said it would remove all plastic carrier bags from its stores over the next year.\nThe Co-op said it would replace the plastic bags with compostable carrier bags selling for 10p \"when current stocks are exhausted\".\nCo-op Food chief executive Jo Whitfield said the increased use of bags for life had led to a sharp rise in plastic use. \n\"With over 1.5 billion bags sold each year by retailers, this remains a massive issue for our industry as many shoppers are regularly buying so called 'Bags for Life' to use just once and it's leading to\u202fmajor hike in the amount of plastic being produced.\"\nThe Co-op has also published a new report called \"Bag to Rights\" in which it details some recommendations it is making to government on plastic bag use. \nThe plastic bag levy, which is already 10p in Scotland, is set to double to 10p in England next month. However, the Co-op wants to see the minimum price for reusable bags being set at 50p, to encourage customers to use them more than once. \nIt also wants all single-use carrier bags to be compostable.  \nIn addition, Ms Whitfield said: \"We believe that it should be mandatory for all retailers to report on the sales of all of their reusable bags, not just single-use bags.\n\"Right now, Co-op is the only major retailer to report on all of the bags it sells. This policy would enable a fuller understanding on the impact of the levy and its true effect on shopping behaviours when customers are making decisions at the tills.\" \nEarlier this month Morrisons said it would switch from offering plastic \"bags for life\" to a paper alternative.\nIn recent years, all supermarkets have tried to cut plastics use.\nWaitrose is currently trialling the removal of its 10p bags for life from several of its stores.\n\"Our trial is ongoing but we're already seeing a drop in uptake in our bags, as intended, suggesting more of our customers at our eight trial stores are reusing them. This is hugely positive and we're optimistic about a wider roll out in the near future,\" said a spokesman. \nSainsbury's has said its bags for life cost 20p to encourage customers to re-use them and are made from 100% recycled plastic.\nAsda has defended its continued use of plastic bags for life previously, saying they were a \"sustainable alternative to single-use carrier bags... particularly given the concerns around CO2 emissions related to the paper-bag production process\"."

      "tags": "Hull,Fishing,Brexit,Fishing industry",
      "text": "Fishing crews have been \"disastrously let down\" by the government's failure to reach a deal with Norway, UK Fisheries chief executive has said.\nUK fleets will not have access to Norway's sub-Arctic seas, following the breakdown of UK-Norway negotiations. \nOne trawler, which catches 10% of fish sold in chip shops, will be tied up for a year following the collapse in talks.\nThe government said it had offered a \"fair deal\" but the two sides were \"too far apart\" to agree a deal this year. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said fishing communities had been \"betrayed by the prime minister\".\nThe UK's departure from the EU means it is no longer part of the European Common Fisheries Policy and instead negotiates with Norway directly over fishing catches. \nThe UK and Norway have a basic post-Brexit agreement on fishing, but annual negotiations are still needed to pin down detailed numbers. \nThose negotiations are meant to conclude by the beginning of each year, but the timing of the EU-UK trade deal in December 2020 had a knock-on effect that meant everything was delayed. \nThe failure to reach a deal means Norwegian vessels will also lose access to UK waters in 2021. But one of the main species they catch is blue whiting, and a lot of that is caught in the first couple of months of the year which have already gone. \nUK vessels, on the other hand, fish throughout the year for cod. \nAnd as warmer sea temperatures push cod stocks further north, they cannot replace the cod they have been catching in Norwegian waters by fishing in UK waters instead. \nMany people in the fishing industry felt let down by the EU-UK trade deal, but that was about its future potential.  \n\"This is actually a loss of real fishing opportunities,\" says Barrie Deas of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, \"and in that sense we've gone backwards\".\nBig Scottish fishing firms will be able to catch more mackerel because of the absence of Norwegian vessels in UK waters, but most of the rest of the industry will be bitterly disappointed. \nThe government will argue that it had to stick to its guns in a tough negotiation, and there was always likely to be some upheaval as a result of the UK exit from the Common Fisheries Policy. \nIt changes the UK relationship with big fishing countries like Norway, as well as with the EU itself. \nAndrew Crook - president of the National Federation of Fish Friers - warned that it could increase the price of fish and chips.\n\"We rely on having some domestic catch to keep the market stable and any lack of competition is going to have an impact on prices,\" the fish and chip owner said.\n\"We are already seeing large increases on almost all of our supplies and we fear this will continue.\" \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4, Jane Sandell chief executive of UK Fisheries, said the failure to reach an agreement would mean her firm having only 40% of the fishing opportunities of previous years. \nHer Hull-based company employs approximately 100 crew and Ms Sandell said the news would be \"absolutely devastating\" for those workers and their families.\n\"It means so much in this area to our history and our culture... we are in total shock, we never believed this would actually happen.\"\nShe said the lack of a deal would mean their Kirkella trawler - which catches around 10% of all the fish sold in the UK chip shops -  would be \"tied up\" for a year.\nShe also criticised the government for failing \"to deliver on all of the deals we previously had through the EU with third countries\".\n\"So with the Faroes and Norway, the deals have failed and Greenland they didn't even bother starting,\" she told Today.\nThe National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations said the failure to reach agreement would lead to more vessels trying \"to make a living in the constrained waters of the North Sea and West of Scotland\".\nJohn Dixon, 31, from Hull, is second mate onboard the Kirkella and spoke to BBC reporter Pritti Mistry. \nHe says his \"heart dropped\" when he heard the news.  \n\"We're waking up in the morning and we're literally panicking about when money is going to come in.\n\"The fishing community is so large here it's unbelievable and we're all struggling. \n\"I've been fishing since I was 17 - it's in my blood.\"\nHe says two generations of his family have been fishermen - his dad, his granddad and uncles.\n\"If it collapses here and now it's going to stop with me - my son's already told me he wants to go to sea. \n\"In all honesty it's disgusting - you feel betrayed.\" \nElspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said opportunities in the coming year would be \"very constrained\" but added that they \"appreciate the efforts of negotiators who worked hard to try to secure a deal... during what is an extremely difficult year for the industry\".\nA spokesman for the environment department said: \"We have always been clear that we will only strike agreements if they are balanced and in the interests of the UK fishing industry.\n\"We put forward a fair offer on access to UK waters and the exchange of fishing quotas, but we have concluded that our positions remain too far apart to reach an agreement this year.\n\"We will continue to work with them [Norway] over the course of the year.\" \nLabour leader Sir Keir said the prime minister had \"made big promises\" but had \"failed to deliver\". \n\"Whichever way people voted - leave or remain - they don't deserve this,\" he added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Hugely popular US podcast host Joe Rogan has backpedalled on his comments that young, healthy people could forgo the coronavirus vaccine.\n\"I'm not an anti-vax person,\" Rogan said. \"I believe they're safe and encourage many people to take them.\" \nBut Rogan did not walk back his suggestion that the young and healthy do not \"need\" vaccines, which drew backlash from White House officials. \nExperts say everyone over 16 should get vaccinated to stop the virus' spread.\nThe Joe Rogan Experience was Spotify's most popular podcast in 2020, though the streaming giant did not share the number of times his episodes were downloaded. Rogan has more than seven million followers on Twitter and 12.5 million followers on Instagram. \nHis podcast was acquired by Spotify last year for more than $100m (\u00a377m).\nAsked about Rogan's comments, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci repeated guidance from experts that unvaccinated, asymptomatic people can still transmit Covid-19.\n\"Even if you don't have any symptoms, you're propagating the outbreak,\" Dr Fauci said. \nRogan made the comments during a 23 April episode of his podcast, which was first reported by Media Matters this week. \nIn that episode, Rogan told listeners that he would not suggest the vaccine to a healthy 21-year-old. \"If you're a healthy person, and you're exercising all the time, and you're young, and you're eating well...like, I don't think you need to worry about this.\"\nResponding to the criticism on his podcast on Thursday, Rogan said the argument that young people need the vaccine \"for other people\" made sense.\n\"But that's a different argument,\" he added.\nAnd Rogan stressed that he should not be a source of scientific advice. \"I'm not a doctor,\" he said. \"I'm not a respected source of information, even for me.\" \nThe TV host-turned media mogul regularly courts controversy for his blunt and sometimes inflammatory style on air. He has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcast. Rogan has denied these accusations and said his comments were taken out of context.\nJoe Rogan is a huge draw for Spotify - so much so, in fact, that his show was mentioned in Spotify's quarterly earnings call. Joe Rogan's podcast had \"performed above expectations,\" the company said.\nSpotify wants to be the place you go to for podcasts and The Joe Rogan Experience is a major plank in that strategy. You might come for Joe Rogan, but stay to listen to other podcasts.  Spotify says it's seen a \"strong increase\" in the number of people listening to podcasts since the pandemic hit. \nHowever wrapping yourself around a controversial figure like Rogan has its dangers - and this saga illustrates that risk. \nRogan said when he signed the deal with Spotify that he would have editorial control. Spotify have publicly backed the podcaster. \nBut of course Spotify does have the power to pull the podcast.\nAs ever Big Tech says it's is trying to balance two things: risk to the public v freedom of speech. \nHowever there's always a third factor. Money.\nWhen the face of your podcast offering says something that US politicians, the White House and medical experts deride as dangerous - that doesn't look good for Spotify's brand. \nFor now, it looks like Spotify is willing to back the podcaster, and Rogan will hope his retraction will draw a line under the matter.\nRogan is not the only US public figure to be accused of anti-vaccine remarks.\nCurrent US Vice-President Kamala Harris said during the election campaign last year that she would not trust any vaccine approved by the Trump administration. Then-US Vice-President Mike Pence accused her of \"playing politics with people's lives\".\nTwo coronavirus shots - by Pfizer and Moderna - were subsequently granted authorisation under Mr Trump. Ms Harris received the Moderna jab after the election and said then it was safe.\nLast year, both Rogan and Spotify faced criticism over the appearance of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his show. \nThe streaming giant has so far stood by its star host, touting Rogan's podcast in its first quarter earnings report this week. Spotify did not immediately return a BBC request for comment. \n\"We have 8 million creators, and hundreds of millions of pieces of content,\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told Bloomberg News. \"We have a content policy and we do remove pieces that violate it.\" \nUS and global health authorities have found Covid-19 vaccines to be safe and effective in preventing infection and safety checks continue throughout the world. \nExperts have warned that misinformation has been fuelling vaccine hesitancy.\nIn the US, nearly 100 million people have been fully vaccinated. This week, President Joe Biden urged all Americans to get their jab, calling it a \"patriotic duty\". "

The marrying couple and witnesses are included in this number, but people working at the wedding are not. \nThe government hopes that more restrictions will be scrapped on 9 August, subject to a decision next month.\nThe number of people who can attend wedding or civil partnership ceremonies or receptions is determined by the size of the venue and a Covid risks assessment. \nThe celebration must be organised by a business in a regulated venue, such as an hotel.\nFace coverings must be worn indoors by everyone aged 11 and over when not eating or drinking, unless they have a reasonable excuse. \nThis does not apply to the married couple or the person officiating. \nFood and drink are permitted in line with hospitality guidance. \nThere is no limit on the number of people at a wedding, but venues must assess how many they can safely accommodate. \nDuring the ceremony, face coverings must be worn by everyone (unless exempt), apart from the wedding couple and the person officiating.\nReceptions can take place, subject to the following rules:\nSome rules are due to change on 26 July, subject to approval on 22 July.

This is the first photo of her released in that time. \nShe appeared in court earlier in April, her first appearance since her arrest. \nMs Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim sent the photo in a letter to Judge Alison Nathan on Thursday.\nIt said guards had confronted her about the bruise, and said they would put her in a special housing unit if she did not say how she had received it. \n\"While Ms Maxwell is unaware of the cause of the bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has grown increasingly reluctant to report information to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores,\" Ms Sternheim reportedly said. \nOn Thursday Judge Nathan ordered an explanation of if and why guards were conducting \"night time surveillance\" on Ms Maxwell, and if she could be given an eye covering if needed. \nIn August 2019, Epstein killed himself behind bars while awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges. \nMs Maxwell, the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, was in a relationship with financier Epstein in the 1990s. She allegedly introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family.\nShe faces six counts including sex-trafficking of a minor and sex-trafficking conspiracy. She also faces a further two charges relating to allegations of perjury in 2016.\nTwo new charges brought in March relate to allegations that Ms Maxwell recruited a 14-year-old girl to provide Epstein with sexualised massages between 2001 and 2004.

Her mum is also a Lib Dem candidate.\nEducation and the environment are priorities for her, along with mental health \"because wherever you're from, this pandemic has hit you\".\nShe's voting for the Lib Dems because they have \"specifically made a manifesto for the youth in Wales\".\nShe says it's \"huge\" that people her age are able to vote, especially after everything that's happened in the past year.\n\"Moving forward, it's all about sticking together now - and taking action which unites rather than divides,\" she says.\nFollow 5 Live's local election coverage on the free BBC Sounds app."

      "text": "Care home residents in England will be allowed one regular visitor from 8 March, in the first easing of lockdown since its reintroduction last month.  \nThey will be able to meet indoors and hold hands - but visitors must wear PPE and be tested beforehand.\nThe health secretary said the move was a \"first step\" to allow more visiting.\nDowning Street sources say an \"absolute priority\" is to try and reunite families and give people more social contact as lockdown is eased.\nA final meeting is expected to be held on Sunday before Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveils his road map for easing lockdown on Monday.\nThe prime minister has said that reopening in schools in England will be the first step.\nIt is understood that other options under consideration include two households mixing outdoors at some point in the coming weeks.\nNew data is expected to suggest vaccines have cut transmission rates. \nBut the latest NHS England data shows that three in 10 care home staff have not received their first coronavirus vaccine, despite being in the top four priority groups for a jab. \nEvery care home resident in the UK has now been offered their first vaccination.  \nIn addition to the new rule for care homes, outdoor visits - as well as those inside pods or behind screens - will be able to continue. \nThe government said the new measure, which follows advice from the deputy chief medical officers and Public Health England, is the next step towards normal indoor visits resuming. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he was pleased people would soon be \"carefully and safely reunited with loved ones\".  \n\"This is just the first step to getting back to where we want to be,\" he said. \"We need to make sure we keep the infection rate down, to allow greater visiting in a step-by-step way in the future.\"  \nLiz Kendall, shadow minister for health and social care, said families had been calling for the resumption of care home visits - made safe with access to personal protective equipment and testing - for seven months. \n\"Over this period, ministers have repeatedly failed to grasp how important families are for the physical and mental health of care home residents, and the appalling impact preventing visits has caused,\" she said. \nIn Scotland, care home residents will be allowed up to two designated visitors once a week, under Scottish government guidelines due to be published on Wednesday.\nMichael Blakstad says the new visiting rules have come \"too late\" for his wife Tricia, who has Alzheimer's disease and lives in a care home in Hampshire.\nSince moving into the care home last July, Tricia has only been able to see visitors who wear face masks and for a short period of time over a fence, Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nHe believes the restricted visits, combined with periods of isolation, with no contact other than her carers, has led to her Alzheimer's deteriorating much faster than it should have done.\nAs a result, Tricia has gone beyond the point where the new visiting provisions would make a meaningful difference, Michael says.\n\"It's far too late for Tricia now. Two or three months ago, Matt Hancock promised on your programme that every care home would have this testing by Christmas, it didn't, the home Tricia's in never adopted it, and I think it's too late. \n\"It would have made a difference to us and it will make a difference to new people who come in now, so that's to be thanked for, but it really should have happened a lot earlier... Tricia has passed the point of no return I'm afraid.\"\nChief nurse for adult social care Prof Deborah Study said while she knew people wanted to \"hug and kiss their loved ones\", lives could be put at risk so people had to follow the rules. \nShe added: \"We all hope to be able to take further steps in the future.\"\nJames Tugendhat, chief executive of HC-One, Britain's largest care home provider, said the move was \"welcome news\" for families and colleagues.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Visiting is obviously a fundamental and necessary part of care home life and we certainly feel very ready now for visiting to resume, with lateral flow testing, with vaccination, with PPE, with infection control.\"\nWhile only one named person will be able to make the visits, care homes will have the discretion to allow more than one visitor in exceptional circumstances. Full details on the plans will be given before 8 March. \nNadra Ahmed, executive chair of the National Care Association, said she understood how difficult it would be for families to select just one nominated visitor, but it was about \"mitigating risks\", adding that it could be \"up to the resident sometimes to nominate that person\".\nShe told BBC Breakfast that the biggest issue for care homes would be having enough staff to manage testing and extra cleaning. \n\"Staff resource is our biggest problem,\" she said. \"We have staff who are exhausted, we've got staff who are going down with Covid and also getting long Covid.\n\"We have no insurance in our services for Covid-related risks - that still hasn't been sorted out by government in any way, so there will be all sorts of things about mitigating risks, but the default is we want to enable this visiting.\"\nMike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, warned there must be \"a note of caution\" because Covid has not gone away, and called for further clarity on the plans.\nHe said: \"We need some clarification - for example, the announcement says holding hands will be allowed but warns against 'close contact'. How is that going to be possible? There is going to have to be some very close but compassionate supervision of these visits.\"\nThe devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds:\nOffice for National Statistics data shows that coronavirus infections are continuing to decrease around the UK - but experts have warned that infection levels remain high, with about 553,000 people identified as having the virus.\nOn Friday, it was announced that another 533 people had died within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the UK's total by that measure to 119,920."

      "tags": "ITV,Television,Bafta Awards,Noel Clarke,Film,Sky",
      "text": "ITV has decided to pull the final episode of the drama Viewpoint after allegations of sexual harassment were made against its star, Noel Clarke.\nThe broadcaster said it was \"no longer appropriate to broadcast the final episode\" on Friday as planned.\nSky has also \"halted\" its work with Clarke, including on the fourth series of crime drama Bulletproof.\nThe Kidulthood and Doctor Who star, 45, has said he \"vehemently\" denies \"any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing\".\nIn a statement on Thursday, he said he intended to \"defend myself against these false allegations\".\nThe Guardian newspaper reported allegations from 20 women, all of whom knew Clarke in a professional capacity, on Thursday.\nOn Friday, ITV said it had \"a zero tolerance policy to bullying, harassment and victimisation\".\n\"We strongly believe that everyone deserves to work in a supportive and safe environment,\" it added.\n\"In light of the very serious nature of the allegations against Noel Clarke raised by 20 women in the Guardian's report, ITV has decided it is no longer appropriate to broadcast the final episode of the drama Viewpoint on ITV main channel this evening.\"\nHowever, the finale will be available on its streaming service ITV Hub from Friday night for a limited time \"for any viewers who wish to seek it out, and watch its conclusion\".\nClarke played a surveillance detective in the show, which has been on ITV every evening this week. It was watched by 3.5 million people on Thursday.\nHe is also known for his role in Bulletproof, which Sky commissioned for a fourth series in January.\nBut following the allegations, Sky said: \"Effective immediately, we have halted Noel Clarke's involvement in any future Sky productions.\"\nThe broadcaster said it had not received any reports of sexual misconduct or harassment during or since the show's production. \"Sky stands against all forms of sexual harassment and bullying and takes any allegations of this nature extremely seriously,\" it added.\nBulletproof's production company Vertigo Films also said: \"Effective immediately, Noel Clarke is removed from any Vertigo Films production.\"\nA spokesperson for the company said it had \"launched an urgent investigation to find out if any [alleged incidents] apply to any Vertigo Films productions\", but that \"no issues have been flagged to us\".\nFellow Bulletproof actor Ashley Walters responded to the allegations against his co-star by saying he was \"in shock and deeply saddened by what I have heard on a multitude of levels\".\nHe said he \"could never condone behaviour of this nature\" and while \"Noel has been a friend and a colleague for several years, I cannot stand by and ignore these allegations\".\nHe added: \"Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying have no place in our industry.\"\nIn his statement on Thursday, Clarke added: \"In a 20-year career, I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me.\n\"If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected, I sincerely apologise.\"\nClarke has also been suspended by Bafta, weeks after he received one of the British film and TV academy's top awards. He was given the outstanding British contribution to cinema prize at a ceremony on 10 April.\nIn a letter sent to its members on Friday, Bafta defended its decision to go ahead with the presentation despite having received emails about Clarke's behaviour before the ceremony.\n\"These were either anonymous or second or third-hand accounts via intermediaries,\" it said. \"No first-hand allegations were sent to us. No names, times, dates, productions or other details were ever provided.\n\"Had the victims gone on record as they have with The Guardian, the award would have been suspended immediately. Noel Clarke's counsel received a legal notice to this effect. It was always very clear what our intentions would be.\"\nThe organisation described the allegations as \"extremely serious\" and said the alleged behaviour was \"contrary to Bafta's values and everything it stands for\".\n\"We completely understand why the individuals were extremely fearful to identify themselves to us, and we recognise how hard it is for victims to speak up,\" it said. But Bafta added that it was \"an arts charity that is not in a position to properly investigate such matters\".\nActor, writer and director Michaela Coel was among those praising the women who spoke out in the Guardian, and the journalists for their investigation.\n\"Speaking out about these incidents takes a lot of strength,\" she wrote on Friday.\nMeanwhile, production company All3Media, which backs Clarke's own company Unstoppable Film and TV, said: \"We take allegations of this kind extremely seriously and are looking into this as a matter of urgency.\"\nPaul Fleming, general secretary of arts union Equity, said it had been \"a difficult day for those who run the industry\".\n\"It's a phenomenally embarrassing and traumatic 24 hours if you're a gatekeeper and in charge of what goes on in our members' workplace,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM Programme.\n\"It really does take something to be here, [the] best part of four years on from #MeToo and still be asking these questions.\n\"And for big bosses, big producers to have not put in place the polices practises and cultures in workplaces that allow these things to be considered credible\u2026\n\"This is a really, really damning indictment of how intimidating some workplaces and some producers are for our members to raise concerns.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "A World War Two landing craft buried 30ft (9m) underground for the past 74 years has been unearthed by volunteers.\nThe Buffalo LVT was brought in to provide flood defences around Crowland, in Lincolnshire, in 1947, but was swept away and sank into a hole.\nA team of volunteers spent five days excavating the vehicle and now hope to restore it and put it on display.\nDaniel Abbott, chairman of the Crowland Buffalo LVT group, said he was \"overwhelmed\" and \"over the moon\".\nThe amphibious vehicle was one of 16 deployed to protect the town in March 1947 after floods caused the nearby River Welland to burst its banks\nHowever, as the flood waters were pumped back, five of the 26ft-long machines floated away. One was later recovered, two sank in fishing pits and two sank into a hole.\n\"This is something I have been working on for three years, and I never dreamt in five days we would have one out above ground for people to see,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\"It's in fantastic condition for its age.\"\nMore news from across Lincolnshire and Yorkshire\nHe said getting it out of the ground was only the first stage in the project, and a fundraising appeal had been launched to help restore it.\n\"We would ultimately like to have it located somewhere within the town as a memorial to the 1947 floods and the Herculean efforts made to repair the bank and remove the flood water,\" he added.\n\"I've always said I wanted to get one out in time for the 75th anniversary and we are ahead of schedule now.\"\nHe said the vehicle, which had seen operations in the Rhine, would form the focal point for local children to learn about the floods.\nSource: Imperial War Museum\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "tags": "Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Care home residents will be able to leave their home for low-risk trips without having to self-isolate for 14 days afterwards, the government says.\nThe rules will be relaxed in England from Tuesday, allowing for walks or garden visits without self-isolation.\nThe government says a fall in Covid cases means it is \"much safer\" for care home residents to go outside.\nThe charity John's Campaign says it is a \"chink of light\" for residents and their families.\nBut co-founder Julia Jones said she wanted to see the full guidance before making a decision about the charity's threat of legal action against the government's 14-day self-isolation requirement.\n\"I still struggle to see what legal right the government thinks it has for preventing people with full mental capacity walking out of their homes the same as any other member of the population,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nThere are different rules in the UK's devolved nations, with residents in Wales able to leave homes - where there is no Covid outbreak - without isolating on their return.\nScotland's guidance for care homes allows for residents to see loved ones outside of the care home, while rules for care homes in Northern Ireland vary by region.\nUnder the changes in England, residents on trips out must be accompanied by either a member of staff or one of their two nominated visitors and they must follow social distancing throughout.\nThey cannot meet in groups or go indoors, except for the use of toilets, and public transport should be avoided where possible.\nAn exemption is in place for those who wish to vote in person in the local elections on 6 May, the government says.\nOnly trips deemed \"low risk\" are exempt from the self-isolation rule, so this does not include activities such as overnight visits.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said updated guidance would be published in due course.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"pleased\" residents can \"now leave their homes to reunite with their loved ones outdoors\".\n\"With the data continuing to head in the right direction and as restrictions ease, it is my priority to keep increasing visits for residents in the coming weeks in a safe and controlled way,\" he said.\nFourteen days is a long time to be stuck in your room because you have ventured out with a relative for a walk or a visit to a park.\nGuidance put in place to protect people from a virus which has claimed so many lives in care homes has more recently become a source of great anguish for many residents and families.\nAs life has begun to open up for others, younger people with disabilities, as well as older residents, have felt unable to leave their care home, trapped by the requirement to self-isolate on return.\nGovernment guidance is there to balance the risks faced by an extremely vulnerable group of people, but with most residents vaccinated and infection rates falling, families complain that the guidance is too slow to change. \nThey argue that with each month of restrictions, the damage to the people they love deepens. \nCare Minister Helen Whately said: \"I know residents and their families have found the restrictions on trips out of care homes incredibly difficult.\n\"This is one more step towards getting back to normal, while protecting care homes from the continued risk of Covid-19.\"\nThe government is expected to review the self-isolation requirement for more visits when it reaches the next stage of the government's road map for easing restrictions on 17 May.\nMs Jones from John's Campaign said it seemed \"massively inadequate\" to retain any restrictions on leaving care homes. Keeping residents \"under surveillance\" had a \"terrible impact\", particularly on younger people living in care homes, she said.\nShe said: \"It's not just about going for a walk in the park, it's about meaningful contact and inclusion in society and everyday life.\n\"It's about equal access to healthcare, it's about equal access to the outside world. It's about being treated as a person in a home not some sort of second-class citizen with no rights or choices.\"\nCampaigners say the rule encourages care homes to act unlawfully by \"falsely imprisoning\" residents, with family members calling it \"barbaric\".\nLeigh Day partner Tessa Gregory, who is representing John's Campaign, said: \"It appears under the threat of legal proceedings, which the John's Campaign were due to issue next week, the government has finally agreed to drop the blanket requirement that care home residents self-isolate for 14 days following any visit out.\n\"This will be a huge relief to residents, families and care homes who have all been crying out for change.\"\nShe added they would be \"scrutinising\" the new guidance once it is published \"to ensure that it is lawful and fit for purpose\".\nThe Independent Care Group also welcomed the move, saying a lack of social contact and visits has been detrimental to the health of residents. \nMike Padgham, the group's chair, told BBC Radio York the decision could have come earlier, adding that residents' human rights had been breached \"to an extent\" by the rules.\n\"Who are we to say that just because people live in a care home that you can't do this, you can't do that? Everyone in this country deserves freedom and when people see the rest of the country being unlocked it seems very unfair on these clients,\" he said.\nHowever, Nadra Ahmed, executive chairman of the National Care Association said that while it was a \"cautious step forward\", care homes still had to deal with insurance policies that do not cover them if residents catch Covid.\n\"One claim would be it for us,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, urging the government to underwrite the risk of care home residents going out and mixing with the general population.\nCare home residents in England have been allowed one regular visitor since 8 March, in the first easing of lockdown."

      "text": "NHS workers in Wales have urged politicians to pledge above-inflation pay rises ahead of the Senedd election.\nThe British Medical Association said pay rises should reflect a \"horrible year\", while Unison wants all staff to receive an immediate \u00a32,000 pay rise.\nA call for a \"significant and simple deal\" has been made by Royal College of Nursing (RCN).\nThe next Welsh government must decide if recommendations of an independent pay review under way will be accepted.\nRCN Cymru director Helen Whyley, said: \"We believe nursing pay has fallen behind inflation for a number of years and this is the year to get it right. To close the gap.\n\"There should be a significant, simple deal brought forward and paid quickly so that our members get money in their pay packets that they so deserve given how they have stepped up in the coronavirus [pandemic] and the things they have had to do in the last twelve months or so.\n\"If we really want to get the NHS back on its feet we need to reward the skills and competencies that nurses have shown. So, whatever the parties might say in their manifestos, they cannot afford not to do this.\"\nWhile the four major political parties have all said they will respect the outcome of the review, expected to report this summer, only Plaid Cymru has specified a minimum increase - 4% - it would commit to implementing if it forms the next government.\nThe bodies representing NHS staff were angered when the UK government, which sets pay levels in England, said it wanted to limit pay rises to 1%. It made the claim in its evidence to the pay review body. \nIn its own evidence, the then-Labour Welsh Government did not set a cap on what it would be prepared to pay.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nFor the past year NHS staff have been on the front-line of Wales's response to the pandemic, putting themselves at risk to treat sick patients and to provide care for the dying. \nBBC Wales asked the political parties what was the minimum percentage increase in pay they would implement if they were in government.\nWelsh Labour said it had funded a bonus payment to more than 220,000 NHS and social care staff, on top of an earlier \u00a3500 payment for social care staff, in recognition of their \"huge contribution\" every day and particularly during the pandemic.\n\"We will move our NHS and care system forward by putting in place the biggest recovery plan the Welsh NHS has ever seen, giving care workers the guarantee of the living wage, training 12,000 health professionals and establishing a new medical school in north Wales,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"We understand the anger of staff across the NHS at the paltry 1% pay rise offered by the UK Tory government. Unlike the Tories in England, we haven't set an arbitrary cap on pay. \n\"The Welsh Labour government didn't include a cap on wage increases in its evidence to the pay review bodies and we wait to see their recommendations.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said they would deliver the pay review board's full recommendation with \"no ifs, no buts\".\nLeader Andrew RT Davies added: \"I believe we should be rewarding our dedicated Welsh NHS workers and carers to the full value that we possibly can as a country.\"\nPlaid Cymru has pledged to match the 4% rise offered staff in Scotland as a guaranteed minimum.\n\"We will also seek to agree with unions and NHS employers a clear plan that will deliver the 12.5% real terms increase necessary to undo a decade of cuts in the shortest timescale possible,\" said a spokesperson.\nWelsh Liberal Democrats will also await the recommendations of the independent report, but said they were committed to ensuring NHS staff \"receive the pay and recognition they deserve\", gaining parity across the NHS and social care workforce.\nUKIP Wales did not respond to the question and have made no firm commitments on the issue of NHS pay during the election campaign.  \nReform UK also did not respond to the question but, in its wider health policy, has pledged to invest \u00a31bn over four years to clear the NHS backlog caused by Covid.\nBMA Cymru wants to see an above-inflation rise close to 5% for all NHS staff and said it was reassured that Welsh political parties had not set a cap on pay rises similar to the UK government. \n\"We would like to see something close to 5 per cent to reflect just what an almighty, horrible year it has been, not just for doctors,\" said its chairman Dr David Bailey. \n\"I hope that everyone who has worked in health and social care will get their just reward for what has probably been the worst year in all of our careers.\"\nUnison Cymru Wales, which represents a broad spectrum of NHS staff from cleaners to nurses, said its demand for a \u00a32,000 rise was not a \"Covid-bonus pay claim\".\nPaul Summers, the union's lead officer on health in Wales, said: \"This is to recognise the years that pay has not gone up with the rate of inflation. \n\"It is an absolute scandal that we have NHS staff who have to rely on food banks to feed their families. \n\"Our pay claim would mean that we would go above the real living wage rate of over \u00a310 an hour. It is to rectify the poor pay awards of the past as well.\""

People were thrown up in the air - others were crushed on the ground,\" he told Ynet news. \n\"There was a kid there who kept pinching my leg, fighting for his life. We waited to be rescued for 15-20 minutes in this crazy, terrible crush. It was awful.\"\nOne survivor who was taken to hospital told the Kan public broadcaster that \"no-one knew what to do\". \n\"It started with heavy crowding. There was a lot of people on top of me. I was lying on someone else who wasn't breathing. There were screams, chaos. I saw children underneath me. The only thing going through my mind was that I didn't want my child to be an orphan.\"\nA pilgrim who gave his name as Yitzhak told Channel 12 TV: \"We thought maybe there was a (bomb) alert over a suspicious package. No one imagined that this could happen here. Rejoicing became mourning, a great light became a deep darkness.\"\nOne pilgrim who did not give his name said there was a \"carousel\" effect and people were pushed right and left. \n\"After 20 minutes I think people started suffocating so they wanted to get out, but no-one was able to get out. There were people under me who were not breathing anymore. There were horrible screams of 'I can't breathe'.\"\nHe said the screams slowly stopped and the scene was \"chaos\".\nAnother eyewitness told Maariv: \"We were at the entrance, we decided we wanted to get out and then the police blocked the gate, so whoever wanted to get out could not get out. In that hurry we fell on each other, I thought I was going to die.\n\"I saw people dead next to me.\"\nDov Maisel, director of operations for volunteer-based emergency services organisation United Hatzalah, told the BBC that immediately \"there was a need for a massive amount of medical response there\".\n\"It felt like a surreal scene where we had over 20 people undergoing CPR by our teams with limited ability to evacuate from the scene simply because the place was too overwhelmed with people.\n\"The evacuation stage took longer than we would have imagined... it was simply impossible. It was very very tough, I must say.\n\"I've been in this for over 30 years, and a scene like this I've yet to see,\" Mr Maisel said.\nWorshipper Menachem Engel told the BBC he \"saw tons of ambulances arriving. \"I saw four-five people being carried on stretches.\"\nShlomo Katz said he was waiting for friends when he saw paramedics running and trying to resuscitate children at the same time.  \nA witness who helped look after the injured told Haaretz: \"I had just sat down to eat when I heard the screams. We rushed to help and then we saw the bodies. At the start it was about 10. Now there's many more.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson's personal mobile phone number has been freely available on the internet for the past 15 years, it has been revealed.\nIt was published in a think tank press release in 2006, but never deleted - and appears to be the one the PM uses.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"a serious situation [that] carries a security risk\". \nBut Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that, as far as he was aware, \"all security protocols have been followed\". \nIt appears the number has been switched off but Downing Street still has not confirmed if the number will now be changed. \nQuestions have been raised in recent weeks over who has access to ministers' personal phone numbers, amid a wider row about lobbying and influence.\nThe PM had reportedly been advised by senior officials to change his number, but this has been denied by Downing Street last week. \nSir Keir said: \"A lot of people will be concerned, not just about who has got the number but who has been using it.\n\"What has come out in recent weeks is [about] privileged access - those who can WhatsApp the prime minister for favours - and this all is further evidence that there is one rule for them and another rule for everybody else.\"\nThe Labour leader also said he had changed his number when he became director of public prosecutions in 2008, adding: \"I have kept it secure since then.\"\nBut Mr Sunak said what made the PM \"special\" was that he was \"incredibly approachable\".\nHe added: \"You see it whenever he is out and about - people feel they can relate to him, they can talk to him, they can tell him what's on their mind.\"\nMr Sunak also revealed he had not changed his own personal phone number since becoming chancellor last February.\nThe think tank press release with the PM's number on it was related to Mr Johnson's then-job as a shadow higher education minister - and MP for Henley - and invited journalists to contact him for further comment.\nTwo years later, he successfully stood to become mayor of London.\nFormer national security adviser Lord Ricketts warned hostile states with \"sophisticated cyber capabilities\" or criminal gangs could now have access to Mr Johnson's digits.\nThe crossbench peer also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he would have thought changing your mobile number when becoming PM would be an \"elementary security precaution these days\".\nBut earlier this week, the UK's top civil servant, Simon Case, told MPs that officials \"put security packages around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means\".\nHe added: \"The level of encryption and standards of security on everybody's mobile phone increasing all the time.\" \nLabour MP Rachel Hopkins said the incident had implications for security, lobbying and the risk of blackmail.\nBut Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins said the PM was \"aware of his responsibilities\" on national security.\nShe told the BBC that she had \"complete and utter confidence\" that Mr Johnson and his advisors knew what needed to be done for him to fulfil those \"duties\". \nIt was revealed earlier this month that the prime minister had contacted businessman Sir James Dyson at the start of the pandemic.\nIn an exchange of text messages, Mr Johnson promised to \"fix\" a tax issue for Sir James, whose company planned to work on building ventilators during the pandemic. \nThe PM said he had done the \"right thing\" in \"shifting heaven and earth and doing everything I possibly could\" to help increase supply. \nIn responding to the urgent call for help at the start of the pandemic, Sir James also wanted to be clear about complying with rules and protecting the business from any extra costs or liabilities.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was wrong that people \"who've got the prime minister's number can access him and ask about tax breaks\".\nThe Daily Telegraph recently reported the UK's most senior civil servant, Simon Case, had suggested Mr Johnson change his number because it was too widely known. \nAnd the Times reported last week that a Universal Credit claimant once contacted the PM directly \"asking for help with their benefit claim\" after they were passed his number by a friend.\nMinisters are issued with official mobile phones when they get a job in government, but they are allowed to keep their own personal devices."

      "text": "Actor Noel Clarke has said he's \"deeply sorry\" for some of his actions and will seek professional help, but has again \"vehemently\" denied sexual misconduct.\nHis statement comes after 20 women accused him of harassment and bullying. ITV and Sky have now dropped his shows.\nHe said: \"I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing. \n\"Recent reports however have made it clear to me that some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise.\"\nHe added: \"To those individuals, I am deeply sorry. I will be seeking professional help to educate myself and change for the better.\"\nThe statement follows ITV's decision not to broadcast the final episode of the police drama Viewpoint, in which he stars, on Friday.\nHis Viewpoint co-stars Bronagh Waugh and Alexandra Roach tweeted their support to the women who made the allegations.\nSky has also \"halted\" its work with Clarke, including on the fourth series of crime drama Bulletproof.\nAnd he has been suspended by Bafta, almost three weeks after the British film and television academy gave him an award for his outstanding contribution.\nClarke is known for playing Mickey Smith in Doctor Who from 2005-10, and for his film trilogy Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood. He is also a writer, director and producer.\nHe played a surveillance detective in Viewpoint, which has been on ITV every evening this week. It was watched by 3.5 million people on Thursday.\nBut on Friday, the broadcaster said it was \"no longer appropriate to broadcast the final episode\" as planned in light of the allegations.\nHowever, the finale will be available on streaming service ITV Hub from Friday night until Sunday \"for any viewers who wish to seek it out, and watch its conclusion\".\nMeanwhile, Clarke has starred in three series of Sky crime drama Bulletproof, which had a fourth series commissioned in January.\nThe broadcaster said on Friday: \"Effective immediately, we have halted Noel Clarke's involvement in any future Sky productions.\"\nBafta has been criticised by some for honouring Clarke on 10 April. It had received reports of allegations against Clarke in the 12 days between announcing him as the award recipient and the ceremony itself.\nAccording to the Guardian, Bafta's chairman Krishnendu Majumdar said he had heard that as many as 12 women could be making allegations.\nIn a letter to members in which it defended its response, Bafta said the emails it received \"were either anonymous or second or third-hand accounts via intermediaries\".\n\"No first-hand allegations were sent to us,\" it said. \"No names, times, dates, productions or other details were ever provided.\n\"Had the victims gone on record as they have with the Guardian, the award would have been suspended immediately. Noel Clarke's counsel received a legal notice to this effect. It was always very clear what our intentions would be.\"\nBafta added that it was \"an arts charity that is not in a position to properly investigate such matters\".\nThe Charity Commission said Bafta had \"submitted a serious incident report\", which the regulator is now assessing.\nPaul Fleming, general secretary of arts union Equity, said it had been \"a difficult day for those who run the industry\".\n\"It's a phenomenally embarrassing and traumatic 24 hours if you're a gatekeeper and in charge of what goes on in our members' workplace,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM Programme.\n\"It really does take something to be here, [the] best part of four years on from #MeToo and still be asking these questions.\n\"And for big bosses, big producers to have not put in place the polices practises and cultures in workplaces that allow these things to be considered credible\u2026\n\"This is a really, really damning indictment of how intimidating some workplaces and some producers are for our members to raise concerns.\""

      "text": "UK house prices rose by 7.1% compared with a year ago, the Nationwide has said, prompting one analyst to suggest the market is \"on the boil\".\nThe building society said the average property price had risen by \u00a315,916 in the last year, to reach \u00a3238,831.\nThe Nationwide said increased savings during lockdown meant some first-time buyers would be better placed to afford a home.\nBut prices could continue to rise as homes available did not match demand.\nLucy Pendleton, from independent estate agents James Pendleton, said: \"This market is on the boil.\n\"Silly season might be just around the corner. That's when a seller's market becomes entrenched against a backdrop of very high demand and you start to see open houses for properties that are nothing special and a return of gazumping.\"\nThe Nationwide said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 2.1% compared with March.\nYear-on-year price growth accelerated as well, driven in part by the extension in stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe pandemic has led some people to reassess their domestic set-up, with demand for more space coming to the fore.\n\"Our research suggests that while the stamp duty holiday is impacting the timing of housing transactions, for most people it is not the key motivating factor prompting them to move in the first place,\" said Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner. \nThe state of the market saw some people queuing overnight outside an estate agent in Wales as homes for a new development went onto the market.\nNationwide's figures are based on its own mortgage data, and it suggests that the market is likely to continue to be busy for the next six months, owing to the stamp duty relief.\nPrice growth was also likely to accelerate, it said, with demand expected to exceed the supply of homes on the market.\nThat is generally bad news for first-time buyers, but the building society said some - with the help of their families - would be in a better position having had the opportunity to save money during the pandemic.\nA typical first-time buyer would need to save \u00a319,500, or around 50% of their gross earnings, for a 10% deposit on a mortgage, Mr Gardner said.\n\"The fact that around a third of first time buyers in England in 2018-19 said that friends or family helped them to raise a deposit through a loan or gift suggests that the recent surge in savings will help some, but that the impact won't be spread evenly,\" he said.\nOn the same day, Barclays boss Jes Staley said that built-up savings would help to create the biggest economic boom since the aftermath of World War Two in the UK.\nThe Nationwide said that the longer-term outlook for the housing market was more \"uncertain\".\n\"If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply,\" Mr Gardner said.\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: \"Numbers like this won't last forever but the market may not begin to unwind until the busy summer season is out of the way.\""

      "text": "The number of empty shops has risen again, with one in seven across Britain now vacant, according to new research.\nAll areas saw a rise but the North of England suffered the biggest hit, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.\n\"After a third national lockdown, it is no surprise that the vacancy rate has continued to soar,\" BRC chief Helen Dickinson said. \nRestrictions came on top of already difficult High Street conditions and further closures are likely, she said.\nThe BRC's quarterly report, compiled with the Local Data Company, found that in the first three months of 2021, the overall vacancy rate increased to 14.1%, from 13.7% in the previous quarter. \nThis was 1.9 percentage points higher than in the same point in 2020, and marks three years of increasing vacancy rates, the report said. \nShopping centres, whose landlords have been hit hard during lockdown and by the shift to online, saw vacancies increase to 18.4% in the January-March period, from 17.1% in the previous three months.\nThe report said 12% of shopping centre units have been empty for a year or more.\nMs Dickinson said: \"The forced closure of thousands of shops during the first quarter of 2021 has exacerbated already difficult conditions for the retail industry. We estimate there are around 5,000 fewer stores since the start of the pandemic.\"\nThe areas with the highest vacancy rates were the North East (19.3%), Wales (19.2%), and North West (17.7%). Greater London had the fewest empty shops at 10.7%, followed by the South East (12.7%) and East of England (14.1%). The report covers retail sites in England, Scotland and Wales, but not in Northern Ireland.\nThe government's business rates relief, introduced as a Covid support measure for retailers, is due to end in England this summer. Restrictions on enforcing evictions are also due end. Ms Dickinson said this would mean more stores may never reopen.\n\"The devolved nations have already agreed to extend the business rates holiday until 2022 and England should consider following suit,\" she said.\nThe plight facing many of the owners of the UK's major shopping centres underlines the problems facing retail. Some big retailers, including Debenhams, have collapsed or closed outlets.\nHammerson, whose shopping centres include the Birmingham's Bullring and London's Brent Cross, said earlier this month it was cutting rents in a bid to help revive outlets.\nLucy Stainton, director at the Local Data Company, said shopping centres have been particularly exposed to the effects of the pandemic, principally having a lower proportion of \"essential\" retailing as well as being exposed to categories which are in decline such as fashion, department stores and casual dining.\n\"This being said, the early indications from the first few weeks of the unlocking have shown there is still significant demand for physical retail and eating out,\" she said."

      "text": "The UK is about to experience its biggest economic boom since the aftermath of World War Two, according to Barclays boss Jes Staley.\nHis upbeat assessment came as Barclays revealed its profits for the first three months of this year had more than doubled from a year earlier to \u00a32.4bn.\n\"We estimate the UK economy will grow at its fastest rate since 1948. That's pretty spectacular,\" he said.\nThe vaccine programme and built-up savings will help to drive the rebound.\nMr Staley said that a combination of the successful vaccine rollout and Barclays' estimate of an extra \u00a3200bn sitting in customer and company bank accounts meant the UK would join the US in seeing some of the fastest economic growth in decades. \nThe boost in Barclays' latest profits was almost entirely driven by a more confident view on how many of its loans would be repaid. \nThis time last year, the bank set aside more than \u00a32bn to cover the risks that borrowers would be unable to repay all of their debts. This time round they are setting aside just \u00a355m.\nInterestingly, Barclays - unlike other big banks in the UK and US - have decided not to adjust previous estimates of bad loan previsions, but hinted that they will do so in future. \nIt will be equally interesting to watch just how much of their total \u00a39bn kitty for future estimated debt defaults they are prepared to reconsider. \nAssuming the worst regarding future defaults is sometimes called \"stuffing the cookie jar\" - a jar that can be raided when needed to boost future earnings. All banks do this to a greater or lesser degree, \nBut Mr Staley seems convinced that despite virus-related disasters in developing economies such as India and new lockdowns in developed counties such as Japan, the overall picture looks to be improving.\nHe also concedes that many business sectors (like hospitality and leisure) have faced desperately challenging circumstances and it is unclear how many of the five million workers still on furlough can expect to return to full-time work. \nThere are many business owners who will not recognise the rosy picture he paints of the UK's economic future. \nIt is probably wrong to talk in terms of an economic boom after we have seen the biggest economic downturn in 300 years, but Mr Staley is in tune with his US counterparts when he hopes and expects that, for him and his many business customers, the worst is behind us.

      "tags": "Israel,Judaism",
      "text": "The disaster in which dozens of people were killed in a crush at a holy site in Israel happened as they marked the Jewish festival of Lag B'Omer.\nWhile the tens of thousands who were at the event were predominantly ultra-Orthodox, Lag B'Omer is a festival which is celebrated by all manner of Jewish communities around the world.\nThe festival itself commemorates two historical events according to Jewish tradition: the passing of revered Second Century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, who ordained that the anniversary of his death be a time of rejoicing at his life; and the end of a plague which killed some 24,000 students of another great rabbi, Akiva Ben Yosef (who lived around the same time as Bar Yochai).\nThe deadly crush took place at the tomb of Bar Yochai in Meron, northern Israel, considered one of the holiest Jewish sites in the country. It is a place of pilgrimage especially on Lag B'Omer, where tens of thousands of Jews from Israel and around the world gather to say prayers and celebrate through the night.\nThe day of celebration and special customs follows a 32-day period of semi-mourning for the deaths of the Akiva's students and, according to some beliefs, the negative traits which may have brought about their suffering. During these weeks, observant Jews refrain from pleasurable or joyous activities including weddings, haircuts or listening to music.\nOn the 33rd day - Lag B'Omer - the restrictions end and the day becomes one of the most festive in the Jewish calendar. Weddings are held, as Lag B'Omer is considered an auspicious day to get married; in observant communities three-year-old boys have their first haircut (known as an upsherin); and people come together to sing, dance and hold parties (and in some places street parades, including a huge one in New York). \nLag B'Omer celebrations are particularly associated with bonfires, said to have a mystical significance. A big one is lit at the tomb of Shimon Bar Yochai. So many take place across Israel that councils have taken to issuing restrictions and the fire service has one of its busiest nights of the year."

      "text": "Faith and community leaders in the UK have united in grief with Israel after at least 45 people were killed in a crush at a crowded religious festival. \nThe chief rabbi led tributes after the disaster at the Lag B'Omer celebration in the north-east of Israel. \nThe Queen and PM Boris Johnson also sent condolences following the \"devastating scenes\" at the annual event, which left some 150 injured. \nPrayers will be said in at synagogues for the bereaved and the injured. \nChief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said: \"As we struggle to come to terms with the horrific scenes of tragedy in Meron, the worst peacetime loss of life in Israel's history, this is a moment to unite in grief and prayer. \n\"May the memory of those lost to us forever be a blessing and may the injured be granted a refuah shelemah (a speedy recovery).\"\nThe Queen sent a message to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin saying she was \"deeply saddened\", adding: \"My thoughts are with those who have been injured and the friends and families of those who have lost their lives. They have my deepest sympathy.\"\nTens of thousands of Orthodox Jews had attended the all-night festival, making it the largest event in Israel since the coronavirus pandemic began. \nEmergency officials said a crush had occurred at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday). It reportedly started after some attendees slipped on steps, causing dozens more to fall.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has travelled to the scene, said Sunday would be a day of national mourning. \nMichael Goldstein, president of the United Synagogue - a union of British Orthodox Jewish synagogues - said the news from Israel was \"devastating\". \n\"We are heartbroken that a night of celebration could so quickly turn to a day of mourning. We share the pain of all the families who have lost a loved one,\" he said.\nMany people in the UK are already contacting organisations offering help and support. \nMagen David Adom UK - a British body set up to assist Israel's national medical emergency, disaster, ambulance and blood service Magen David Adom (MDA) - said it was already receiving calls and donations from the community. \nChief executive Daniel Burger said: \"Throughout the night we have received updates from our colleagues in Israel, each more devastating than the one before. The horrific events at the Lag B'Omer celebrations in Meron have turned what should have been the happiest of nights into what will be the saddest of days.\"\nHe also called for blood donations from any Britons in Israel. \n\"The immediate concern is the blood supply in Israel,\" he said. \"MDA has put out an urgent request and we would urge any Brits on Gap Years or other programmes to go to their nearest blood donation centre and give blood.\" \nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews said a day intended for celebration would now be linked to mourning for the loved ones of those affected. \nMarie van der Zyl, president of the organisation, said: \"We are devastated at the news that a celebration for the festival of Lag B'Omer has led to such a tragic loss of life. \n\"Lag B'Omer traditionally celebrates the cessation of death of religious students from a terrible plague in Roman times. It is a bitter irony that the day will now become partly known as a day of mourning for the families affected.\"\nRabbi Celia Surget, chair of the Assembly of Reform Rabbi and Cantors, said she was \"devastated\" over the loss of life and sent wishes for healing for all those involved.   \nBoris Johnson said on Twitter: \"Devastating scenes at the Lag B'Omer festival in Israel. My thoughts are with the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.\"\nOthers paying tribute included Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and UK ambassador to Israel, Neil Wigan. \nIsraeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, said she sent \"condolences to the families of the deceased and my prayers to the wounded\". \n\"Let us pray for our Jewish brothers and sisters at this time of great grief,\" she added. \"May the memory of those lost be a blessing.\""

      "tags": "Social distancing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More of us are now able to meet up outside with friends and family.\n\"The evidence is very clear that outdoor spaces are safer than indoors,\" Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, has said. \nResearchers say infections can happen outdoors, but the chances are massively reduced.\nFresh air disperses and dilutes the virus.\nIt also helps to evaporate the liquid droplets in which it is carried.\nOn top of that, ultraviolet light from the Sun should kill any virus that's out in the open. \nEven so, there are a handful of cases where it's believed that infections did happen outside.\nOne study found that two men in China talking face-to-face for at least 15 minutes was enough to spread the virus.\nIf someone's infected - maybe without realising it because they have no symptoms - they'll be releasing the virus as they breathe, especially if they cough.\nSome of that will be carried in droplets, most of which will quickly fall to the ground but could reach your eyes, nose or mouth if you're within 2m (6ft) of them.  \nSo the advice is to avoid being face-to-face if you're that close.\nThe infected person will also release smaller particles called aerosols. \nIndoors, these can accumulate in the air and be a hazard. Outside they should rapidly disperse. \nWalking past someone in the street or having a jogger run by you, means you're close together for a few seconds at most. \nFleeting encounters are highly unlikely to be long enough for enough virus to reach you. \nProf Cath Noakes, an airborne infection expert from the University of Leeds, says someone would have to cough right at you, at the moment you're inhaling, for an infection to happen. \nBut she also warns of friends spending a long time together outdoors and assuming they're completely safe.\nGoing for a run with someone and following close behind them for 20 minutes or more, breathing in their slipstream, might be a problem, she says.\n\"The sad fact is that your greatest risk is from the people you know.\" \nScientists have found that the risks are low in fully open spaces.\nBut they worry about areas that are not just crowded but also partly enclosed, such as market stalls or bus shelters. \nWhenever the air is still, it can become stagnant and contaminated. \nIt's in environments like narrow pathways or busy queues that government advisers say face coverings may be needed. \nIf an infected person coughs into their hand and then wipes it on a surface, the virus may survive there for hours.\nResearchers in the US found virus on the handles of rubbish bins and the buttons at pedestrian crossings.\nThey reckon this may have led to infections in the area, though at a relatively low level compared with other ways of spreading the virus. \nIn colder weather, the virus may last longer in the open - it thrives in low temperatures. \nAdded to that, your nose runs in the cold, and a common reaction is to wipe it with your hand.\nThat might raise the chances of surfaces becoming contaminated.\nHowever, many scientists now think that the amount of virus likely to be left on a surface in this way would be minimal, and would disperse within an hour or two.  \n\"The chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small,\" says Prof Emmanuel Goldman of Rutgers University.\nAll the evidence points to the vast majority of Covid infections happening indoors.\nThe virus is transmitted through human interaction, especially when people are together for a long period of time.\nThat means the virus can spread in several different ways. \nEither infected droplets can land on people close by, or contaminate surfaces that others touch.\nAnd if rooms are stuffy, tiny virus particles can accumulate in the air and get inhaled. \nIt's in households where all of this is most likely to happen."

My thoughts are with this officer, their family and colleagues.\"\nThe Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI), which represents rank and file officers, said the attack was a \"vile act of attempted intimidation\".\n\"This was thuggery and an attempt to intimidate an off-duty officer...an act of terror, an act of madness,\" said PFNI chair Mark Lindsay.\nThe chair of the Policing Board, Doug Garrett, described the attack as \"reprehensible\" and said it could have had \"deadly consequences\".\n\"To be awoken to find this destruction in the middle of the night must have been terrifying for the whole family,\" he added.\nDUP MLA and Policing Board member Mervyn Storey said there can be \"no justification or excuse for such an attack\".\n\"Unfortunately we see all too often the threat to which our police officers are exposed to and the callous disregard for both life and property that some within our society display,\" he said.\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member Philip McGuigan also offered condemnation and said those responsible for attacks on the PSNI had \"nothing to offer society\".\nHe said that in recent months there had been \"increasingly violent rhetoric targeting the PSNI and police officers with sinister posters and graffiti appearing in loyalist areas\".\nSDLP MLA and Policing Board member Dolores Kelly described those responsible for the attack as \"criminal thugs\" and said the officer's family had been put through a \"horrendous ordeal\".\n\"Those who have involved themselves in extortion, racketeering and criminality are a poison on the lives of us all and it should be our mission to flush them out,\" she added.\nJohn Stewart, an East Antrim UUP MLA, said it was a \"particularly sinister incident\" and he hoped the perpetrators would be put \"behind bars for a very long time\"."

      "text": "Student complaints about universities have risen to their highest level.\nThe universities watchdog's annual report shows it received 2,604 complaints in 2020, 10% more than 2019.\nOf these, 43% - up from 29% in 2019 - concerned service issues, including facilities, teaching time and academic supervision, and disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which alone accounted for 12%. \nAnd a total of \u00a3742,132 was paid to students as compensation.\nThe Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA), which covers England and Wales, said it had been a \"uniquely challenging year\" for students. \n\"The profound impact of coronavirus has raised difficult questions around what fairness for students looks like in this context,\" its report said.\n\"Many students have experienced huge disruption to their lives as well as to their studies.\"\nUniversity teaching moved online in March 2020, when the first national lockdown was announced, and only students studying more practical courses have been allowed back on campus, since the start of the year. \nStudents in England were told earlier this month they could return on all university courses no earlier than 17 May.\nLast week, a group of students' unions wrote an open letter urging the competition regulator to:\nThe report details a number of cases the OIA has reviewed over the past year, including examples relating to course delivery, the impact of Covid-19, and, in one instance, a student who told a member of the student well-being staff their dissertation supervisor was sexually harassing them and offering higher grades in exchange for sexual activity.\nThe staff member informed the student's academic department, which notified the human-resources department, and the student was allocated a new dissertation supervisor.\nAfter the student complained to the OIA about the time the process had taken, the lack of transparency, and the outcome, the university was told to pay the student \u00a35,000 compensation. \nOverall, the OIA saw a rise in complaints about sexual misconduct in 2020 but the numbers are small.\nThis comes after a number of universities were mentioned on the Everyone's Invited website, which has highlighted allegations of a \"rape culture\" in education settings.\nThe proportion of complaints about academic appeals - such as problems with marking and final degree results - dropped from 48% in 2019 to 33% in 2020. \nThe report suggests this is likely to be largely due to measures to help students during the pandemic.\nA quarter of all the cases dealt with were found to be partly or fully justified, or settled in favour of the student, which is slightly higher than in recent years.\nThe students most likely to complain were those studying:"

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,UK fire safety",
      "text": "New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are \"indefensible\", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. \nThe Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes safer following the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died.\nBut a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion.\nThe government has made a \u00a35bn fund available to remove cladding.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to \"thousands of buildings around the country\".\nShe said the act would \"actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously\".\nAfter the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. \nOther defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems.\nMinisters say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at \u00a350 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. \nLeaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed.\nReports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. \nCampaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. \nCritics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. \nThe Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was \"deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong\". \nIt described the government's position as \"indefensible\", saying it was a \"grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making\", and it accused ministers of \"letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free\". \nLawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a \u00a370,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. \nShe told the BBC the situation was \"completely unbelievable\" and said some days she asked herself: \"Is this even happening?\"\n\"I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career.\" \nLeaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills.\n\"I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,\" she told the BBC. \n\"Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying.\" \nStephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was \"hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own\".\nHe added: \"Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable.\"\nThe campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, \"much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis\". \nIt said the government had \"fought hard\" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from \"widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work\". \n\"This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners\" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added.\nThe group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: \"We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet.\"\nThe new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties.\nThe government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday.\nIt said it struck \"the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers\". \nA Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by \u00a35bn in funding.\n\"We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,\" they added.\n\"For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of \u00a350 per month.\""

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Coronavirus infections in the UK are back to levels seen at the end of last summer with around one in 1,000 people infected, ONS data suggests.\nIn the week to 24 April, infections fell in all four nations of the UK and were 20 times lower than in January.\nIt comes as a new UK study has found very small numbers of people have been admitted to hospital with Covid several weeks after having one vaccine dose.\nMore than half of the UK population has now received a first vaccine jab.\nMeanwhile, BBC analysis shows about 22 million people are now living in areas where there were no Covid deaths in April.\nThe Office for National Statistics survey, which tests a random selection of thousands of people in the community, estimates that about 66,000 people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in mid-April.\nThis is down from the previous week's estimate - and way down on the figure of 1.25 million infected at the peak of the second wave in January.\nThe ONS estimates that in the week to 24 April:\nFor England, it is the lowest figure since the week to 5 September, when the estimate stood at one in 1,400, while in Wales it is the lowest since 10 September.\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, who joined the survey later, the figures are the lowest since their estimates began.\nProf Paul Hunter, professor in medicine from the University of East Anglia, said the ONS figures confirmed the decline in daily cases across the UK and was evidence that the recent relaxation of restrictions had not had a negative impact.\n\"That there is in fact no evidence of an increased transmission risk is reassuring that, for the time being at least, it looks like the current roadmap is still on target,\" he said.\nBut other experts are more cautious, saying we should continue to be aware of the possible spread of variants and any changes in infection numbers.\nThe coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, in England is now estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the latest government figures.\nLast week the R value, which represents the number of people each person with Covid will go on to infect, was between 0.8 and 1.0.\nWhen the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below 1, it means the epidemic is shrinking.\nThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the estimate did not necessarily mean R was definitively above 1 in some areas in England, just that the uncertainty meant it could not be ruled out.\nWhen the number of cases falls to low levels, R estimates can be subject to large fluctuations so it is a less robust way of representing what is happening.\nThe UK has reported another 15 Covid-related deaths within 28 days of a positive test, and a further 2,381 new cases.\nThe government's latest figures also show 34.2 million people have now received a first dose of a vaccine, while 14.5 million people are fully vaccinated having received two jabs.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "At least 44 people have been killed in a crush at a crowded religious festival in the north-east of Israel.\nDozens more were injured at the Lag B'Omer celebration, which takes place annually at the foot of Mount Meron.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to the scene and said Sunday would be a day of national mourning.\nTens of thousands of Orthodox Jews attended the all-night festival, making it the largest event in Israel since the coronavirus pandemic began. \nThe country's successful vaccination programme has allowed it to lift many restrictions, but health officials had still warned of the risk of Covid-19.\nEarly reports suggested a structure at the site had collapsed, but emergency officials later said a crush had occurred at around 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT Thursday).\nPolice sources told Haaretz newspaper that it started after some attendees slipped on steps, which caused dozens more to fall.\n\"It happened in a split second; people just fell, trampling each other. It was a disaster,\" one witness told the newspaper.\nVideos posted online show thousands of people struggling to flee through a narrow passageway.\nLoudhailer messages urged the crowds to disperse, before police requested the full evacuation of the site. \n\"No-one imagined that this could happen here,\" one pilgrim told Channel 12 TV. \"Rejoicing became mourning, a great light became a deep darkness.\"\nDozens of ambulances attended the scene as emergency services laid out bodies under foil covers on the ground. Helicopters took the injured to hospital, while the military said search-and-rescue troops had also been deployed. \nAt least 150 people were injured, officials said, including 38 people who were in critical condition at the site.\nChildren were also caught up in the disaster, and witnesses said paramedics were seen performing CPR on some of them.\nEarlier in the day, officials said they were not able to enforce coronavirus restrictions owing to the huge crowds.\nPolice reportedly said they had arrested two people for disrupting their efforts to keep order before the crush occurred.\nIsrael is a nation in shock.  This is the worst civilian disaster in its modern history.\nQuestions are being asked about how an annual celebration turned into such a tragedy.\nPolice - who were in charge of public security at the site - are used to even bigger numbers turning up and they are already facing criticism. They have launched their own investigation.\nAt Mount Meron, there are still chaotic scenes and hundreds of buses are trying to transport the attendees away.\nMeanwhile, many families have struggled to get news of their loved ones due to overburdened phone services.  \nSome bodies are yet to be identified and funerals are not expected to take place until after the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sunset. Leading rabbis have called for prayers to support the bereaved and injured.\nWitnesses have described the panic as the crush began to unfold. \n\"It was crowded and there [was]... no place to move,\" one attendee told the BBC. \"People started to fall on the ground.\"\n\"All of a sudden we saw paramedics... running by,\" another attendee, Shlomo Katz, said. \"One after the other [they] started coming out... Then we understood that something is going on here.\"\n\"Over 1,000 people together tried to go down a very, very small place, very narrow road and they just fell on top of each other,\" said Yanki Farber, a reporter with the Orthodox Jewish website Behadrei Haredim.\nAn emergency worker told AFP news agency that he saw \"dozens of people fall on top of one another\" and \"a large number of them were crushed and lost consciousness\".\n\"I have not seen anything like this since I entered into the field of emergency medicine,\" Lazar Hyman, a volunteer rescue worker, told AFP.\nAnother first responder, Dov Maisel, told the BBC: \"We just finished treating one of Israel's worst disasters.\n\"A terrible disaster of people who came to celebrate... and unfortunately were literally crushed to death,\" he said.\nTens of thousands of Orthodox Jews make a pilgrimage to Meron each year for Lag B'Omer, a religious holiday marked with all-night bonfires, prayer and dancing. \nThe town is the site of the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a revered Second-Century sage, who ordained that the anniversary of his death be commemorated with a celebration of his life.\nThe site is mostly gender-segregated. Images and video suggest the crush happened in one of the men's sections.\nAccording to the Times of Israel, organisers estimated that 100,000 people arrived on Thursday night.\nAttendance was higher than last year, when the festival was held under restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut it was still smaller than in previous years, when hundreds of thousands of people took part. \nWere you in the area?

      "text": "Apple has been charged with breaking EU competition rules over the way it runs its App Store.\nEuropean Commission anti-trust regulator Margrethe Vestager  tweeted that \"consumers are losing out\".\nIt relates to charges brought two years ago by music streaming app Spotify which claimed that Apple was stifling innovation in that industry.\nApple faces a large fine and may be forced to change its policies if its arguments do not convince regulators.\nPreviously it has denied any wrong-doing. \nThe case is looking specifically at how its App Store policies affect music streaming. The charge was initially filed in 2019 by co-founder of Spotify Daniel Ek, who said that Apple was \"limiting choice and stifling innovation\".\n\"Apple's rules distort competition in the market for music streaming by raising the costs of competing music streaming app developers. This in turn leads to higher prices for consumers for their in-app music subscriptions on iOS devices,\" an EC statement said.\nIn response, Apple said it did not receive any commission on 99% of Spotify's subscribers.\n\"At the core of this case is Spotify's demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don't think they should have to pay anything for that. The Commission's argument on Spotify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition.\"\nAlexander Holland, chief content and strategy officer at music streaming platform Deezer said he was pleased with the Commission's findings. \n\"It's an important step towards a fair competitive landscape where dominant market players like Apple have to compete with independent companies like Deezer on quality of service, innovation and consumer experience, rather than artificially created barriers and a lack of a level playing field.\"\nEarlier Ms Vestager tweeted that the preliminary conclusion of the EC was that \"Apple was in breach of EU competition law\" and \"charges high commission fees on rivals in the App Store and forbids them to inform of alternatives\".\nEC and US regulators have a series of ongoing investigations into Apple's App Store including more widely considering whether the 30% commission it charges for in-app purchases is fair.\nDevelopers have become increasingly frustrated by the so-called Apple tax.\nUnder pressure from both developers and regulators, Apple has cut its commission rate to 15% for any developer than earns less than \u00a31m in annual revenue. \nA complaint was filed to the EC by e-commerce firm Rakuten in March 2020,  alleging that it was anti-competitive to take a commission on e-books sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service. This case will be looked at separately.\nEpic Games, the makers of Fortnite, also filed a similar complaint as part of an ongoing dispute with Apple over its 30% cut on in-app purchases.\nIt led to Apple removing the game from its App Store.\nA court case between the two opens in the US next week and promises to reveal much about Apple's inner workings. It will see testimony from Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Epic chief Tim Sweeney."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nAbout 22 million people in the UK are living in areas that have not reported any Covid-19 deaths occurring in April, according to BBC News analysis. That applied to fewer than 50,000 people during four weeks in January's peak. Scientists welcoming the findings nonetheless urged caution, while the government is calling on people to \"follow the rules so that our roadmap out of lockdown is irreversible\".\nPeople aged 40 and 41 in England can now book Covid jabs, NHS officials say, after nearly 750,000 appointments were made in two days when vaccinations were opened to those aged 42 to 44 this week. About 34 million people - nearly two-thirds of the UK's adult population - have had at least one dose. Northern Ireland has already opened its vaccination programme to those aged 35 and over, Wales is offering jabs to the over-40s, as well as those over the age of 30 in some areas. Scotland is vaccinating people over-45.\nShops, gyms, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Northern Ireland are back in business after four months of lockdown. Caravans and self-contained tourist accommodation can also now reopen. Hospitality businesses must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table, while gyms and pools can only open for individual training or one-to-one coaching with a personal trainer. \nWhile many bars and restaurants hope to welcome people inside within weeks, and anticipate huge demand as restrictions ease in more parts of the UK, many are struggling to recruit enough staff after thousands of workers left the sector. Some have managed to find alternative employment, but a high proportion may have left the UK altogether in the wake of Brexit, according to recruitment site Caterer.com.\nOn what would have been his 101st birthday, the family of Capt Sir Tom Moore are recreating the famous garden walking challenge that saw him raise almost \u00a333m for NHS charities. Celebrities are joining in the fun, after the armed forces veteran's family asked people to create their own charity \"100 challenge\" over the bank holiday weekend.

      "tags": "Policing,Lord Hain,Apartheid,Metropolitan Police Service,Undercover policing inquiry,South Africa",
      "text": "A former Labour cabinet minister who was monitored by Scotland Yard for 25 years has accused undercover police of being on the  \"wrong side of history\". \nLord Peter Hain became a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the 1970s. \nHe told an inquiry officers should have apprehended South African agents rather than track liberals, vicars and anti-racists in causes he was involved with.\nLord Hain is the most senior politician to appear at the inquiry into historical undercover policing abuses. \nDocuments published by the inquiry show that intelligence on Lord Hain's anti-racism activities was directly collected by Scotland Yard officers from 1969 until 1994, three years after he became the MP for Neath. A later police document, dated 2003, describes him as a \"South African terrorist\" at a time when he was in the Cabinet and Leader of the House of Commons. \nPeter Hain came to the UK from South Africa with his parents in the 1960s - they were liberal activists whose lives had become impossible because of their opposition to the racist regime. \nIn 1969, he helped to create the UK's national movement against apartheid, which evolved out of a massive campaign to stop rugby and cricket tours between the UK and South Africa. \nThose campaigns, which led to pitch invasions and other stunts, have long been recognised as having played a critical role in building a mass movement in the UK against apartheid. \nSpeaking at the Undercover Policing Inquiry, Lord Hain demanded to know why he was targeted by Scotland Yard's Special Demonstration Squad, an undercover unit that infiltrated the anti-apartheid movement and the Young Liberals, of which he also became a leader.  \n\"[Undercover] resources [directed at us in the 70s] should have been devoted to catching terrorists, catching drug traffickers and serious criminals, not devoted to keeping an eye on and harassing anti-apartheid protesters,\" he said. \n\"The police have to decide when facing anti-apartheid protesters whose side they are on. And in many cases of undercover officers they made the wrong choice. The police, in targeting us, were putting themselves on the wrong side of history.\"\nLord Hain said his parents' modest lounge in their south-west London flat was the first base for the campaigns to stop the sporting tours - and Scotland Yard documents reveal that an undercover officer called Mike Ferguson managed to infiltrate those meetings. \nFerguson sent reports to Scotland Yard, later copied to MI5, about the movement's plans for non-violent direct action protests. These including warnings that the campaigners would chain themselves to rugby goal posts, a protest that is not a crime. \nAt the same time, South Africa's secret service agents in the UK were plotting to kill leading figures in the anti-apartheid scene. \nLord Hain was personally targeted by a letter bomb that failed to detonate. The 1972 device was the same as others believed to have been sent by South African agents to anti-apartheid activists around the world.\nLord Hain said that during his ministerial career he had signed off MI5 operations against terrorism suspects in Northern Ireland - and had been kept safe by armed police officers. \nHe was Northern Ireland Secretary between 2005 and 2007, and twice served as the Secretary of State for Wales.\nBut reflecting on the 1970s, Lord Hain said: \"Why were they [the police] not targeting the agents of apartheid bombing and killing [and acting illegally in London]? These officers should have been helping to bring down the apartheid system... instead of spying on us.\n\"What I object to is that when it comes to progressive radical movements... we're all presented as somehow subversive or semi-criminal or disrupting England's green and pleasant land. This is completely unacceptable and reprehensible.\"\nLord Hain also referred to the police investigation into the campaign for justice for Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager murdered in a racist attack in south London in 1993.\nA later stage of the inquiry will investigate how and why Scotland Yard gathered information on the campaign.\nIn his evidence to the inquiry, Lord Hain said: \"Undercover policing then gets to the point where, instead of catching the racists responsible for Stephen Lawrence's murder, they infiltrate the Lawrence campaign.\"\nNext week, one of the surviving officers who monitored the anti-apartheid movement will tell the inquiry what he was asked to do."

      "text": "It was the TV crunch match that could determine how parties do in the 2021 Welsh election, but there was no knockout blow.\nLabour, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and Abolish the Welsh Assembly pitched their wits against one another in the first hour, followed by Reform UK, the Green Party and UKIP in the second, 30-minute part of the show.\nHere are the five takeaways from the BBC Wales Live debate.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nYou'd expect jibes, but perhaps not flattery.\nPlaid Cymru's Adam Price paid tribute to Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford as a \"conscientious and serious leader\".\nCordial relations could be required if the two find themselves working together to form a government after the election. \nBut the cordial relations that once existed between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Westminster felt like a distant memory.\nAt one point, Andrew RT Davies uttered the words \"tuition fees\" at Jane Dodds.\nShe pointedly called him \"Mr Davies\" in reply, before saying she was \"ashamed\" of the austerity that began when their two parties were in coalition together.\nMental health came up in response to more than one question, with parties offering to improve services and spend more.\nIt's a topic that would not have featured so prominently in debates like this a few years ago.\nEven before the pandemic, mental health was rising up the political agenda.\nThen came lockdowns and the toll they have taken on so many people's wellbeing.\nAs a result, leaders were falling over each other to promise more help for people if they are in charge in the next Senedd.\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nEvery discussion referenced the pandemic in some way.\nThat's hardly surprising, given what we are all living through.\nBut it was, perhaps, surprising to hear just how little was said about Brexit which completely consumed politics until recently.\nIt barely featured in this debate. When Brexiteer Andrew RT Davies first raised it, even that was in reference to Covid, claiming the vaccination programme was better as a result of us leaving the EU.\nConventional politics distinguishes between bread and butter issues - schools and hospitals - and constitutional questions such as devolution.\nNot in this debate.\nAndrew RT Davies was talking about the vaccination programme when he raised the independence referendum Adam Price wants, saying it would cause \"constitutional chaos\" at a time when attention should be focused on the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, Richard Suchorzewski's answer to all sorts of problems in public services and the economy, as you might expect from the leader of a party called Abolish the Welsh Assembly, was to turn back the clock on devolution.\nPerhaps there was no knockout blow, but they all delivered the core messages of their campaigns.\nMark Drakeford told us Labour was keeping people safe.\nAndrew RT Davies said only he offered change after years in which Plaid and the Lib Dems have propped up Labour first ministers.\nAdam Price said Wales should control its own future.\nJane Dodds disavowed the Cameron-Clegg coalition.\nAnd Richard Suchorzewski repeatedly pressed the case to wind up Wales' parliament."

      "text": "Game of Thrones actress Esm\u00e9 Bianco has sued singer Marilyn Manson, alleging sexual assault and battery.\nThe lawsuit claims Mr Manson coerced the British actress with \"drugs, force, and threats of force\".\nThe plaintiff also alleges the singer and his manager broke trafficking laws by luring her from London to the US with empty promises of work.\nThe artist has rejected multiple allegations of abuse against him as \"horrible distortions of reality\".\nHe has been dropped by his record label and booking agent since the claims surfaced.\nIn February, Westworld actress Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused Mr Manson of domestic abuse. More than a dozen other women have since come forward with similar allegations.\nIn an Instagram post on 1 February, Mr Manson wrote: \"Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners.\"\nMs Bianco, who played Ros on the hit HBO drama Game of Thrones, was among a handful of women who spoke out against Mr Manson earlier this year.\nHer court filing on Friday marks the first legal action over such allegations against Mr Manson, who is referred to in the lawsuit by his real name, Brian Warner.\nMs Bianco says she met the rocker in 2005. The lawsuit says that in February 2009, he invited her to Los Angeles to film a music video. But when Ms Bianco arrived she says she found she was expected to stay at his home and there was no film crew. The plaintiff alleges she was deprived of food and sleep and given drugs and alcohol during her four-day stay.\n\"Perhaps most horrifyingly,\" the lawsuit continues, \"Mr Warner locked Ms Bianco in the bedroom, tied her to a prayer kneeler, and beat her with a whip that Mr Warner said was utilised by the Nazis. He also electrocuted her.\"\nThe legal action says they began a consensual sexual relationship in May 2009 and maintained a long-distance relationship until 2011. \nIn her complaint, Ms Bianco says Mr Manson coerced her into sexual intercourse that was often violent and degrading, sometimes even when she was unconscious or otherwise unable to consent.\nThe plaintiff alleges Mr Manson committed multiple acts of sexual battery against her in 2011 and raped her in May of that year.\nThe suit also accuses Tony Ciulla, who managed Mr Manson for more than 25 years before dropping him this February, of \"supporting [Mr Manson's] violent tendencies\" and allegedly violating US human trafficking laws.\nIt says the duo coaxed Ms Bianco to the US with job opportunities that never materialised, made her perform \"unpaid labour\" on several occasions and interfered with her visa process.\nMr Ciulla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nThe BBC contacted Mr Manson's former agents and an attorney who has previously represented him, but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\"Mr Warner implied that because he had brought Ms Bianco to the United States and provided housing, she owed him labour and sexual intimacy,\" notes the lawsuit.\nIt adds: \"My hope is that by raising [my voice], I will help to stop Brian Warner from shattering any more lives and empower other victims to seek their own small measure of justice.\""

      "text": "People aged 40 and over in England are now able to book their Covid jabs, NHS officials say.\nText messages will be sent to 40 and 41-year-olds, directing them to the national booking service. \nMeanwhile, about 22 million people in the UK are living in areas that have not reported any Covid deaths that happened in April, BBC analysis shows.\nSince the vaccine rollout began in December, about 34 million people have had at least one dose in the UK.\nThis equates to nearly two-thirds of the adult population. More than 14 million people have now had two Covid jabs.\nThe extension of the rollout comes just days after vaccinations were opened to 42-year-olds in England.\nNHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: \"With nine-tenths of people aged 45 and over having been jabbed, nearly three-quarters of a million new appointments were made in just two days as our booking service opened to people aged 42 to 44.\"\nIt comes as fewer than 600 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported so far this month, compared with more than 30,000 in the first four weeks of January.\nThe latest lockdown, together with the vaccination programme, have successfully reduced cases, and as a result deaths.\nDr Mike Tildesley, an expert in the spread on infectious diseases, said it was \"really good news\".\n\"It's a really good sign and we've seen several parts of the country where prevalence is really, really low. So, I think it gives us confidence.\"\nBut he echoed another expert who urged caution.\n\"[We] have seen before, when things go wrong they can go wrong quickly,\" said Prof Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nLifting restrictions slowly means this is less likely to happen, he added.\nPeople who cannot access the booking service online can call the service on 119 to book a vaccination appointment. \nNorthern Ireland has opened its vaccination programme to 35 to 39-year-olds. \nWales, meanwhile, has been offering jabs to the over-40s, as well as younger people in some areas. \nAnd Scotland has been inviting 45 to 49-year-olds.\nThe government plans to offer a first vaccine dose to the rest of the adult population by the end of July. \nThe NHS currently uses three vaccines against coronavirus: \nAnd the government has ordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as part of its plans for a vaccination booster programme in the autumn.\nIt comes as Liverpool prepares to host a government-organised live music event as part of a Covid safety pilot to check what impact easing the rules will have ahead of a full lifting of restrictions later in the year.\nAn indoor club night for around 3,000 people will take place at Circus Nightclub with no social distancing and no face coverings under the government's Events Research Programme (ERP), which will explore the risk of transmission and the effectiveness of measures such as ventilation and testing.\nMeanwhile, shops, gyms, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Northern Ireland will reopen on Friday after a four-month winter lockdown.\nHospitality businesses must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table. Caravans and self-contained tourist accommodation can also now reopen.\nRestrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly further eased, with 15 people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden.\nHave you recently been offered the vaccine?

      "tags": "Housing,Transport for London,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK air pollution,Affordable housing,Mayor of London",
      "text": "Even without a global pandemic, the mayor of London would be facing a demanding term in office. \nThe mayor, who will run a \u00a319bn budget, is tasked with keeping the capital running and making the streets safe. What will be the biggest challenges in the next mayor's in-tray?\nLondon was at the epicentre of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and has borne the brunt of economic fallout worse than any other region. \nAn estimated 1.6 million workers in London were furloughed at some point during the pandemic - the highest rate in the UK. \nLatest figures show more than half a million Londoners claim unemployment benefit, about 6% of the capital's population. Nationally about 4% of the population are on some form of out of work benefit.\nAll of the main money-raising and spending decisions are made by central government, but the mayor has powers over \"strategic planning\". This means he or she can give permission to projects considered important to London's development.\nMostly, though, the mayor's office acts as a business hub, offering support and advice, and connecting companies with investors.\nAs a figurehead, though, the role is central to inspiring business confidence at home and abroad.\nThe mayor will need to use his or her influence to convince businesses and holidaymakers they're safe and welcome to visit - bringing money and jobs to the city.\nTransport for London (TfL) has received \u00a34bn in emergency funding just to keep running since coronavirus hit. \nSince then TfL's finances have become a battleground between the mayor and the government.\nKeeping TfL running and independent will be a key challenge over the next mayoral term. \nSince the pandemic, TfL's fare revenues have fallen by 90% as passenger numbers plummeted to levels not seen since the 19th Century. This is a big problem, as fares make up the majority of TfL's funding. \nLondon is one of the only cities in the world that does not receive government funding to support the operating costs of its transport network.\nImmense challenges lie ahead at City Hall after more than a year under the restraints of a pandemic.\nThe new mayor will need to keep a very close eye on public health. They will have to liaise with the NHS, local councils and the emergency services and be prepared to lead communications if, or when, things flare up again.\nThe economic recovery will gradually absorb more time and energy. Soon the furlough plaster will be removed - and scarring revealed.\nLimited resources. Plenty of levers. The same old mayoral story. \nAhead lies a genuine test of leadership.\nBut how do you get the economic heart of the capital working again? \nIn practical terms, one huge milestone is what the new mayor can agree with the government over transport and how to finance it.\nBut there is a battle too about devolution, and whether the government intends to pull in or let out powers to run the capital.\nOn the two other major areas of influence - policing and housing - there will be no let-up in the scrutiny.\nAnd to add to the mayoral \"to-do\" list will be getting their own house in order.\nIn the autumn, the machinery of the London government will be shifting from City Hall to a new headquarters in a building called The Crystal at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London.\nEven before the pandemic, TfL was dealing with financial pressures on several fronts.\nMuch has been made about Sadiq Khan's flagship policy of freezing fares across the London Underground network for the duration of his term as mayor.\nAlthough controversial at the time, the fares freeze has been fully paid for through TfL's efficiencies programme, outlined in its December 2016 Business Plan, according to City Hall.\nThe escalating costs of the delayed Crossrail project are also huge for TfL.\nEurope's largest infrastructure project is two years overdue and \u00a34bn more expensive than originally planned.\nThis comes at a time when TfL is being denied a source of income from fares, commercial advertising and retail units at stations.\nGetting the project sorted will be at the top of any mayor's new list.\nKnife crime increased steadily over the past five years, before dropping drastically during London's lockdowns.\nIn 2019 the number of teenagers stabbed to death in the capital reached its highest level since 2008.\nViolent crime - a broader category which includes murders, physical attacks and stalking offences - has been increasing in London since 2014, but has now dropped to about 7% below the level in 2016 according to Met Police figures.\nCrime in London should not be looked at in isolation, though.\nKnife crime in England and Wales is at a record high. There were 46,265 offences in the 12 months to the end of March 2020, with the figure having risen every year since 2015.\nThe mayor officially acts as the police and crime commissioner for London, which means the mayor has a role in setting out how London is policed and staffed.\nAs London emerges from lockdown, keeping London's streets safe will be a priority for any mayor. \nThis year, for the first time, London's air quality was recorded at an inquest as a factor in a person's death in the capital.\nElla Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, died in 2013 following years of asthma attacks and seizures.\nSouthwark Coroner's Court found that air pollution \"made a material contribution\" to the nine-year-old's death.\nIn an official \"report to prevent future deaths\" the coroner, called for national pollution limits to be reduced.\nThe capital's poor air quality was linked with about 9,000 premature deaths in 2015.\nA report by City Hall found air pollution in London to have fallen over the past five years.\nThe number of people living in areas with illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide fell by 94% between 2016 to 2019, the report found.\nThe number of schools in such areas fell by 97%, over the same period.\nLONDON'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening: On 6 May, people will vote to elect a mayor and 25 members of the London Assembly. Together they form the Greater London Authority, which governs the capital. You can register to vote online.\nWhy does it matter? The mayor has a \u00a319bn budget, is responsible for transport and policing and has a role in housing, planning and the environment. The London Assembly holds the mayor to account. Find out more here.\nWho is standing? There are 20 candidates running for London mayor and a full list can be found here.\nBut 24% of inner London roads still exceeded pollution limits, and figures show thousands of Londoners still breathe air that breaches pollution limits.\nThe successes have come at a price. City Hall says the improved air quality is due to programmes such as the Ultra Low Emissions Zone. \nThe scheme, which charges older and more polluting vehicles to drive into the capital, has been controversial. Many are calling for it to overhauled or scrapped.\nBalancing the needs of road users and improving London's air quality could be a defining challenge of the next administration. \nCity Hall estimates London requires about 66,000 new homes a year to provide enough dwellings to be ready for expected population growth. \nThis target has never been achieved in the 21-year history of the mayor of London. \nIn 2018-19, the last financial year with complete figures, about 36,000 new homes were built, according to the London Development Database. Of these 6,500 were affordable homes.\nIn the same year, planning applications for 82,000 new homes were approved.\nAccording to City Hall's assessment, about two-thirds of these new homes would need to be affordable homes - a broad category that includes social rented, affordable rented, and intermediate housing.\nThe mayor has few direct powers in relation to housebuilding, though. \nInstead, the role sets targets on the number and type of homes built and works on these with local authorities and developers.\nFinding inventive ways to increase the supply of new homes, particularly affordable homes, will be key for any future mayor."

      "text": "Elliot Page says having transition surgery has been a \"life-saving\" experience.\nThe Oscar-nominated star of Juno has opened up about coming out as a trans man in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.\nHe told Winfrey it was \"crucial and important\" to announce his transition at a time when the trans community is facing a \"horrible backlash\".\nIt was his first TV interview since he announced his transition in an open letter on social media in December.\nThe Canadian-born actor, 34, said having top surgery had allowed him to \"feel comfortable in my body for probably the first time\".\nTop surgery involves the removal of the breast tissue to create a masculine chest.\nPage said the surgery had given him a new energy, \"because it is such a freeing, freeing experience\". \n\"Not only has it been life-changing for me, I do believe it's been life-saving and it's the case for so many people. And because there is such an attack on trans healthcare right now, when already there's such lack of access.\"\nThe actor was referring to a swathe of laws in states across the US outlawing young transgender people from accessing certain medical treatments.\nThe interview, which will be released on Apple TV+ on Friday, was Page's first since he came out as transgender in December, an announcement that was hailed by Hollywood's transgender community as \"inspiring\".\nThe actor said making the announcement had been \"crucial and important\".\n\"In this time we're in right now and especially with this horrible backlash we're seeing towards trans people, particularly trans youth, it really felt imperative,\" he said.\nDuring the interview, Page became tearful when asked what had brought him the \"most joy\" in transitioning.\nPage said it was the \"little things\", such as being able to wear a T-shirt.\n\"It's getting out of the shower and the towel's around your waist and you're looking at yourself the mirror and you're just like, 'There I am'. And I'm not having the moment where I'm panicked,\" he said.\nPage received international acclaim for starring as a pregnant teenager in the 2007 film Juno.\nOther major films include Inception and the X-Men series, while the actor has more recently starred in Netflix series The Umbrella Academy.\nPage came out as gay in 2014, telling an audience in Las Vegas: \"I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission.\"\nThe actor, who was married to choreographer Emma Portner, before announcing their divorce in February, has been a prominent advocate for LGBT rights.\nPage also used the interview to criticise moves by some US states banning transgender athletes from competing in girls sports teams.\n\"If you're not gonna allow trans kids to play sports, children will die,\" Page said. \"And it really is that simple.\"\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by issues raised in this story, sources of support are available at the BBC Action Line."

      "text": "Amazon continued to cash in on our new shop-work-relax-from-home habits in the first three months of this year, reporting a huge rise in sales and a tripling of profits.\nAlmost every aspect of the Covid-19 pandemic has served to boost the tech giant's revenues, from video streaming to grocery delivery.\nIt said it expects the boom to continue over the next few months.\nThe pandemic could herald \"a golden age\" for Amazon, one analyst said.\nAmazon's are the latest blow-out results from Big Tech this week. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google's parent firm Alphabet have all reported big sales increases a year after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Amazon group has continued to spread its reach into automated grocery stores, online healthcare services, even experimenting with a bricks-and-mortar hair and beauty salon in London.\nBut its core offerings: online shopping with home delivery, media streaming and cloud-based web-services all flourished during a year of upheaval for other businesses.\nRevenue rose from $75bn (\u00a354bn) this time last year to $108.5bn for the three months to the end of March.\nProfit was $8.1bn, up from $2.5bn a year ago.\nChief executive Jeff Bezos highlighted the streaming service Prime Video and AWS, the web-services division, and said he was \"proud to have them in the family\".\n\"As Prime Video turns 10, over 175 million Prime members have streamed shows and movies in the past year, and streaming hours are up more than 70% year over year,\" he said.\nHe said AWS had grown in its first 15 years to deliver $54bn annual sales \"competing against the world's largest technology companies.\"\nMr Bezos is stepping down as chief executive this summer, though he will remain in the less hands-on role of executive chairman. He will be succeeded by AWS's chief executive Andy Jassy.\nNicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said Amazon's results were \"stellar\" particularly given the extra costs associated with doing business during the pandemic.\n\"Amazon's modus operandi has always been to pour internally generated cash into new investment opportunities wherever possible - but at present it seems to be struggling to find homes for its embarrassment of riches,\" he said.\n\"This could be a golden age for the group. With high streets shut, Amazon is a natural home for consumers' spare cash, AWS services remote working, which has suddenly become the norm, and tech wizardry is all the more useful when we can't see friends and family in person.\"\nAmazon said although the pandemic was receding in some markets it expected its sales and profits to continue to grow, and it still expected  a further $1.5bn costs related to Covid-19.  \nThe firm has announced it plans to raise pay for its half a million US employees at a cost of more than $1bn. The firm has faced long-running criticism over pay and working conditions, including claims that workers are under so much pressure they can't take toilet breaks and that it was failing to keep warehouse staff safe from coronavirus infection.\nAmazon also announced a raft of measures to support employee health. It has already rolled out vaccinations to 300,000 employees and contractors in the US and \"will soon expand to frontline employees in other countries\".\nThe group will continue to extend its range of shopping services and platforms, including Amazon Scout, a fully electric autonomous delivery system that \"rolls down the sidewalk at walking pace and delivers items right to customers\". Scout is already operating in four US states.\nOther recent innovations include Amazon Pharmacy, which allows Amazon Prime members to save money on prescriptions, Prime Wardrobe which offers personal shopping services and Discover Rooms, which the company described as \"an immersive shopping experience that helps customers browse and shop from thousands of home room designs\"."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

I see them more than my own family. \n\"And then they're not here any more,\" he remembers. \nDamian was working on the hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. \n\"We would always make sure someone was with them,\" he says. \n\"You thought to yourself, if I emotionally connect with every scenario\u2026 you're going to have a breakdown, because you're not going to be able to get yourself right.\" \nAt the time, most of the government's and the country's attention was focused on preventing the NHS being overwhelmed, but in the first weeks of April the number of residents dying in care homes was rising rapidly. \nEaster Sunday, 12 April 2020, saw the highest number of care home deaths during the pandemic in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics: \nOn each of the 20 days from 5 April: \nPatients were being rapidly discharged from hospitals to care homes without being tested, agency staff could move between homes, there was little testing available and some care homes struggled to get sufficient medical support.\nDamian remembers that, initially, the guidance said PPE should be changed every time a staff member assisted a resident but \"within two weeks it changed so you could then help three individuals and then change your PPE. You were thinking it doesn't seem right and feel comfortable to be doing this.\" \nA government spokesperson told the BBC it had done \"everything possible\" to protect care homes.\nAnita Astle owns Wren Hall, and last spring she was desperate to alert people to what was happening.\nOn 31 March, on social media, she described the situation as dire.\nOn 12 April she tweeted: \"Feeling numb - lost nine family members (residents) in last few days.\"\nShe says the government guidance was atrocious and believes social care was overlooked at the start.  \n\"We were clapping for the NHS, we were hearing 'protect our NHS', but there was nothing about social care. It's probably a sad state of affairs that I don't feel angry. I just feel that's the norm.\" \nThe same day Anita posted her tweet, Jean Adamson was trying to see her father through the window at his care home in London. He had Covid. \nShe describes Aldrick Adamson, who was part of the Windrush generation, as fiercely independent, a family man and a musician. \nThat day, on the other side of the glass, he was singing to himself, but Jean says he knew she was there. \nIt was the last time she saw him. \n\"He just went downhill so quickly,\" says Jean.\n\"I still need to know why my father died in a place where he was supposed to be safe from harm.\n\"The government has a legal and moral responsibility to get to the truth, so that people who are bereaved like myself, get the answers and can grieve and get closure, and also, to save people's lives in the future.\"\nOn 15 April, the day Aldrick died and as the virus was at its peak in care homes, the government published its social care plan. \nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press conference: \"From the moment of the emergence of coronavirus, we've known that some of the most vulnerable to this disease are in social care, and we've been taking action right from the start.\"\nHe announced that patients being discharged from hospitals into care homes would all now be tested. \nTesting was also extended for care staff and symptomatic residents, more PPE was promised and he gave his backing to a \"badge of honour\" for care workers. \nBack at Wren Hall, when David Capewell remembers last April tears begin to roll down his cheeks. \nHis wife, Anthea, was one of the residents who contracted the virus. \nHe got a call from the home saying she might not last through the night: \"One of the nurses said 'you had better come in quick'. Anthea didn't look well at all. I spent most of the night with her.\" \nAnthea survived. With restrictions on visiting, David had been able to see very little of her, so he now volunteers as a gardener at the home. \nIt means when he has a break, he can sit on the other side of her window, allowing them to spend extra time together.  \n\"It's such a relief, just to see her through the window,\" he says. \n\"This thing, I hope it goes away so quickly. And that we can all get back to some sort of normality.\"\nA government spokesperson responded: \"Every death from this virus is a human tragedy and our heartfelt sympathies go out to everyone who has lost a loved one. \n\"From the start of this global pandemic we have done everything possible to protect care homes, including placing residents and staff in the highest priority group for vaccinations.\n\"We have increased staff testing to identify new cases and protect residents, while providing almost \u00a31.8bn in specific funding for adult social care and access to over \u00a36bn for local authorities to address pressures on public services, including free PPE for adult social care. \n\"Our vaccination programme is the biggest in NHS history, and through the rollout we have visited every eligible care home in England, offering lifesaving vaccines to all residents and staff.\" "
