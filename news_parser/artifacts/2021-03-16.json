      "text": "UK experts say there will be a big increase in the number of people being offered Covid vaccinations in the coming days. \nThe number of shots given is expected to top 4 million this week, nearly double what has been achieved per week recently, NHS sources say.\nIt should mean all over 50s will have been given at least one dose by the end of the month.\nThat would put the NHS rollout two weeks ahead of schedule.\nThe increase has been made possible by a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute in India, which has arrived and passed safety checks.\nSo far more than 24 million people have already received a first dose of Covid vaccine in the UK.\nVaccination teams are now working their way through the priority list of people in their 50s and younger adults with disability.\nOnce this are completed it will mean all nine of the priority groups in the first phase of the programme will have received a dose.\nThere are just over 30 million people in these groups, which also include frontline health workers.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the vaccination programme was proving to be \"tremendously successful\".\n\"Those first nine priority groups included 99% of all hospitalisations and deaths, certainly in wave one of the pandemic, so we're feeling very optimistic.\n\"We're seeing a very sharp reduction in the deaths and hospitalisations throughout the country.\"\nThe UK reported 5,089 new cases of Covid on Monday, with a further 64 new deaths within 28 days of positive coronavirus test.

      "text": "Boris Johnson has promised to help make the UK \"match-fit\" when he unveils his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy.\nThe prime minister said there would be \"more investment\" in infrastructure and skills around the country.\nHe also announced that 500 Foreign Office jobs would be moving from London to East Kilbride. \nThe government publishes its Integrated Review of the UK's defence and foreign relations capabilities on Tuesday.\nBut a group of MPs has warned that \"general ineptitude\" over the last 20 years has undermined attempts to re-equip the Army. \nThe Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat. \nSome details are being pre-released, including the plan to move 500 jobs to the Foreign Office's East Kilbride hub - which follows news that the Cabinet Office will transfer at least 500 civil servants to nearby Glasgow by 2024.\nThe government has promised \"further commitments\" to \"strengthening the UK's core industrial base\" in the Integrated Review, including building ships in Scotland and armoured vehicles in Wales.\nThere will also be a focus on lithium mining in Cornwall and manufacturing satellites in Northern Ireland, it added. \nThe Integrated Review is billed as the most radical reassessment of Britain's place in the world since the end of the Cold War.\nBut the prime minister wants the new strategy to make a difference at home as well as abroad. He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology.\nAnd, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom.\nMinisters argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad.\nThe test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland. \nMr Johnson said: \"The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people. \n\"So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people.\"\nHe added that the UK's \"international ambitions must start at home\", with investment in regional industry \"ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world\".\nThe government has said \"further jobs\" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England.\nIt has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\nFrom 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by \u00a36.6bn in real terms, but, since then, it has increased by \u00a33bn in real terms.\nA report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at \"serious risk\" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries.\nIt described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as \"woeful\" and criticised what it called \"bureaucratic procrastination\" and \"general ineptitude\" over the past two decades.\nIn a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are\".\nHe added that unless it confirmed a reduction in potential dangers to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\"."

      "text": "Almost 17,000 procedures, operations and diagnostic tests have been cancelled during the pandemic to date, the health minister has said.\nRobin Swann told the NI Assembly that between 17 March 2020 and 5 March 2021, 16,938 procedures, operations and diagnostic tests had been postponed.  \n\"It's important to note that includes cancellations for all reasons, not just Covid-related,\" he said.  \n\"Procedures are often cancelled for a myriad of other reasons.\"\nMr Swann said these included clinical circumstances, patients cancellations or staff pressures. \nBut he added: \"I am assured that every attempt is made to protect the most urgent appointments where this is achievable, and the postponed test procedures and operations will all be rescheduled as quickly as possible.\"\nMore than 4,000 red flag cancer procedures were among the cancellations.  \nThese are operations that can have an impact on a person's outcome from treatment. \nMr Swann said that the five health trusts were currently compiling three-month plans for April to June which, it is hoped will be published shortly.  \nHe said the department hoped to publish \"activity projections\" alongside the plans. \nThe health minister also told Stormont that he had been \"blindsided\" by the manner in which he found out about the Republic of Ireland's decision to pause the use of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine following reports of a small number of cases of blood clots.\nMr Swann said he heard this through the media and he had asked the chief medical officer to engage with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland \"to make sure that we realise the full operational value of that memorandum of understanding\".\n\"It doesn't help either of us when either of us are actually blindsided by a decision that has been taken in either jurisdiction,\" he said.\nHealth officials in Northern Ireland have said they will continue to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nEarlier, Mr Swann stressed the importance of avoiding a \"free-for-all\" situation as coronavirus restrictions are eased and recommended a gradual approach.\nThe executive received the advice in a paper ahead of its meeting earlier on Tuesday.\nThere was also a stark message about signs of \"increased harmful alcohol consumption, more snacking and increased sedentary behaviour as a result of the pandemic\".\nHe said as society begins to re-open, he said he would encourage people to spend more time outdoors and agreed \"the risk is very much lower outdoor than indoors\".\nHowever, the minister added that potentially associated activities such as sharing cars to deliver children to sporting  activities do pose a greater risk of transmission.\nThe Executive was told that research carried out by Ernst and Young indicated that watching and participating in sport were two of the top nine things people missed during the initial lockdown period. \nMr Swann said evidence gathered to date highlights concerns around mental health and domestic violence."

      "text": "St Patrick's Day celebrations will once again be different this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin have been cancelled for the second year in a row, with many events across the island again moving online. \nPolice have warned that anyone breaking Covid-19 regulations in NI will face a \"robust\" response.\nBut while large gatherings are mostly ruled out, attempts have been made to celebrate in style around the world.\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, a record number of places are taking part.\nSome 670 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nThe quirkiest additions to this year's list include an abandoned sauna in Finland and a Smurf statue in Brussels.\nHere's how other places in Northern Ireland and further afield are planning to mark the occasion:\nBelfast has an array of virtual events for people to enjoy from the comfort of their own homes throughout the month of March.\nAn online disco, Irish language festivals and a virtual guided tour of the city's street art are just some of the events on offer.\nSeveral live music events will also be streamed throughout St Patrick's Day, showcasing the city's talent. \nSt Joseph's Church in Sailortown is one such venue celebrating with an eight-hour live-streamed event.\nThe St Patrick's Centre in Downpatrick, County Down is celebrating with a number of online events for St Patrick's Day and also to mark its 20 year anniversary.\nA new show about St Patrick, a children's virtual art competition and a series of podcasts from former BBC politics correspondent Martina Purdy and ex-barrister Elaine Kelly, who are pilgrim guides on the new St Patrick's Way, are just some of the events on offer.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Purdy said that some of the guests involved on the podcast are journalist and presenter Eamonn Holmes, as well as Irish cellist Patrick Dexter, who has found online fame with his open-air recitals, shot outside his cottage in County Mayo. \n\"I was probably less aggressive than I was previously with some politicians,\" she said.\nIt is claimed that St Patrick is buried outside Downpatrick Cathedral. A large granite stone marks the spot, placed there in the early 20th century.\nThe council's Spring and St Patrick's Day programme promises to \"bring some colour\" to the city and district, according to mayor Brian Tierney.\nHe thanked event organisers for a programme that \"strikes a balance between giving the public something to look forward to and celebrate, while also keeping everyone safe\".\nEvent organiser Jacqueline Whoriskey said: \"While we will not be holding any public events or gatherings, we have focused in on how we can creatively bring the spring spirit to our streets with artwork and installations, with fairy dwellings and artistic sculptures that can be enjoyed by everyone when out getting some fresh air and exercise\".\nArmagh's At Home With St Patrick Festival includes events such as online wreath making and an Irish dancing master class. \nAll events are free of charge, however, some do require registration in advance.\nThe council is marking Irish Language Week and St Patrick's Day with a series of online performances and storytelling.\nAll events have moved online and the festival includes music and dance performances, streamed live from the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh and the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen.\nThe council is streaming a series of craft workshops, musical entertainment and dance performances live on social media channels throughout the day. \nPolice in Northern Ireland have appealed for anyone celebrating St Patrick's Day to ensure that they adhere to all public health regulations.\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland on Wednesday, through to the early hours of Thursday.\nThe substantial policing operation will see officers patrolling beauty spots and the Holyland area of south Belfast.\nPolice said that a number of gatherings have already been broken up by officers in south Belfast ahead of St Patrick's Day.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that people know the rules and those breaking them could face fines.\nSaint Patrick lived in the 5th Century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nWhile St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nThe city's St Patrick's Festival runs from 12 to 17 March, with more than 100 online events around the theme of Awaken Ireland.\nOrganisers have partnered with Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 for the virtual parade.\nThe celebrations will be broadcast around the world to a potential audience of 80 million people, organisers said.\nThe Queen has extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.\"\nPresident Michael D Higgins said that the British monarch's visit in 2011 was \"such a moment of healing\" and expressed his appreciation for her \"good wishes on our national day\". \nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition will continue this year, albeit virtually. The bowl will be placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders will discuss, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland, according to the White House.\nMr Biden, who has strong links to Mayo and Carlingford, will no doubt want to celebrate his Irish roots. \nBefore a visit to the land of his forefathers in 2016, the then US vice-president said: \"Being Irish, without fear of contradiction, has shaped my entire life.\"\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River event but the city's mayor was determined to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nChicago's mayor Lori Lightfoot tweeted: \"Happy St. Patrick's Day Weekend, Chicago! Although we didn't gather, we were able to honor long-standing tradition by dyeing the Chicago River green, thanks to the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers.\""

      "text": "Portugal will be removed from the \"red list\" of countries from where travel to England is banned after 04:00 GMT on Friday, the Department for Transport has announced.\nIt means returning travellers will be able to quarantine at home, rather than in a hotel at a cost of \u00a31,750.\nBut Ethiopia, Oman, Somalia and Qatar will be added to the travel ban list.\nUnder the current rules, foreign travel from the UK is banned apart from for exceptional reasons.\nThe earliest date people from England will be able to travel abroad for a holiday is 17 May, when the government hopes to move to step three of its lockdown exit plan.\nHowever, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps last week warned it was still too early to book foreign summer holidays, saying there were \"lots of questions\" to answer about \"how safe it will be in June to travel\".\nThe \"red list\" is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the country.\nAfter the changes come into force, British and Irish citizens or residents arriving in England from Ethiopia, Oman, Somalia and Qatar will have to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, and any other visitors will be refused entry.\nA ban on commercial and private planes travelling from Oman, Ethiopia and Qatar will also come into force on Friday to reduce the risk of importing \"variants of concern\".\nIn a statement, the Department for Transport added that Portugal had been removed from the red list, including Madeira and the Azores, following evidence that showed the risk of importing a variant \"had reduced\".\nMauritius will also be removed from the red list.\nMeanwhile, Portugal has extended until 31 March a ban on commercial or private flights between mainland Portugal and the UK, as part of continued restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\nPortugal's government has said that only flights \"of a humanitarian nature\" are allowed to and from the UK.\nQatar's international airport is popular for people returning to the UK on connecting flights from countries in Asia and Australasia, so its addition to the red list will have a significant impact.\nA travel ban is already in force for the United Arab Emirates, which is another Gulf hub.\nUnder current lockdown rules, people arriving in the UK now have to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining, and some must pay to self-isolate at a hotel.\nThere are concerns existing vaccines may not work quite so well against some variants of coronavirus, including the South Africa and Brazil variants.\nAs such, there are currently travel bans on countries \"where the risk of a new variant is greatest\".\nUK residents and Irish nationals arriving in England from red list countries have to quarantine in hotels selected by the government.\nRule-breakers face stricter penalties, including a prison sentence of up to 10 years for those who lie about having been in a banned \"red list\" country.\nThe UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions, meaning Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own travel rules, which differ slightly."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.\nColman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father.\nCarey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director.\nKirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively.\nOther British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.\nSix black actors and actresses are nominated, equalling the record set in 2017. This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song.\nDavis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever.\nAhmed is the first actor of Pakistani descent to get an Oscar nomination and the first Muslim to be up for best actor; and Yuh-Jung Youn is the first South Korean actress to get an Oscar nod. \n\"Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!\" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor.\nMinari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers. Its rivals for that award include Judas and the Black Messiah, which is the first best picture nominee to have an all-black line-up of producers.\nBoseman is nominated alongside Davis for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - his final role before he died of cancer at the age of 43 last year.\nThe much-loved star, who is also known for his role in Black Panther, is the favourite to be given the best actor award.\nIf he does, he will be only the second posthumous best actor winner after Peter Finch for Network in 1976.\nOnly five women had been nominated for best director before, and only one has won - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010.\nThis year, two of the five contenders are female, with Chinese-born, US-based Zhao the hot favourite for her story of a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who lives a nomadic life in a van.\nZhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night.\nFennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year.\nOverall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards.\nThe 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy.\n\"I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,\" she said.\nHer previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year?\nProbably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel.\nPlus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance.\nMank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture.\nCrucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. \nIt has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited.\nMank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves.\nIt would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley.\nI have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nVaccine safety experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) meet later to review the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, having urged countries not to pause Covid vaccinations over concerns about recipients who developed blood clots. On Monday, a WHO spokesman said there was \"no evidence\" the incidents were linked to the vaccine. However, several European nations are halting the rollouts as a precaution, despite the EU's medicines regulator saying vaccinations should continue.\nIt started, insiders say, with an initial \"lack of concern\" and the absence of a \"proper\" plan. Our political editor Laura Kuenssberg hears the inside story of No 10's battle with the pandemic from 20 senior ministers and officials, past and present. Here's how 12 turbulent months unfolded, through Boris Johnson's hospitalisation, a prime ministerial \"rush of blood\" over summer reopening and the apparent success of an \"expensive gamble\" on vaccines.\nWithout urgent action, the UK's cancer death rate will rise for the first time in decades. That's according to a group of 47 cancer charities, in light of NHS figures suggesting tens of thousands fewer people started cancer treatment since the first lockdown than during normal times. Radio 1 Newsbeat reports.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to set out dates for the end of the \"stay at home\" rule and the reopening of shops and hospitality this afternoon, after reviewing the latest scientific advice with her cabinet. Some measures could be phased in from 5 April, with further changes later in the month and more to follow in May. \nHow have you spent lockdown?

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe, the health secretary has said, after some European nations paused its use amid concern over blood clots.\nMatt Hancock urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\" as soon as they got the opportunity.\nSome 13 countries have suspended use of the vaccine while they seek further clarification on its safety.\nBut the UK's medicines watchdog, the MHRA, has said that evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots.\nThe EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of blood clots in vaccinated people on Thursday. \nHowever, it said previously that it was still \"firmly convinced\" the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine outweighed the risks and there was \"no indication\" the jab causes blood clots. \nAbout 17 million people across the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week, the manufacturer AstraZeneca said.\nIt said the number of cases of blood clots reported was lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population.\nIn a bid to reassure the British public, Mr Hancock stressed that the MHRA, the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency all believed the vaccine was safe.\n\"We keep the effects of these vaccines under review all the time and we know that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is saving lives in the UK right now so if you get the call, get the jab,\" he said. \nAsked if there had been evidence of people declining the jab after the European suspensions, the health secretary said there were still \"huge numbers of people vaccinated every day\" and that \"enthusiasm for getting the vaccine is incredibly strong\".\nDowning Street has also defended the safety of the vaccine, with the PM's official spokesman insisting that Boris Johnson would be happy to take it when it came to his turn.\nMeanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall revealed on Tuesday that she had received the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab earlier this year.\nSpeaking during a visit to a pop-up vaccination centre in London with the Prince of Wales, Camilla joked that it \"didn't matter\" which jab she was given because \"I hate injections so much\".\nIt was announced in mid-February that Prince Charles, 72, and the duchess, 73, had received their first Covid jabs. Their ages meant they were included in the fourth priority group for the rollout of the vaccine.\nThe latest government figures show that 24,839,906 first doses of a Covid vaccine have now been given in the UK, with some 1,663,646 people receiving a second dose.\nCountries across Europe are seeking further clarity on the jab's safety, amid criticism of their decision to suspend its use.\nDenmark was first to pause its use of the vaccine, followed by Norway and Iceland. Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Spain, Latvia and Sweden are the latest to follow suit.\nGermany, France and Italy have said they are awaiting the outcome of the EMA investigation.\nThey said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the jab, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer it.\nDr Phil Bryan, vaccines safety lead at the MHRA, said that people \"should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so\".\n\"We are closely reviewing reports but given the large number of doses administered, and the frequency at which blood clots can occur naturally, the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause.\"\nThe WHO, which is also investigating the reports, says there is no evidence that the clots were linked to the vaccine and it has urged countries not to pause their vaccination programmes.\nProf Jeremy Brown, a member of the UK government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said concerns about blood clots were \"overblown\" as they were unlikely to be linked to the jab. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme pausing its use would cause more illness and deaths than would be prevented \"by the unlikely situation that there's an increased risk of a very rare event occurring as a consequence of the vaccine\". \nSir Kent Woods, former chief executive of the MHRA and former chair of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast there would have been a \"denting of public confidence because of the disorderly situation in Europe\" and by suspending the use of the jab countries were \"increasing the risk to the population\". \nDr Jess Harvey, a GP in Shropshire, said she had received several calls from patients concerned about the possibility of blood clots linked to the vaccine. \nShe said she had not had any appointments cancelled yet but was worried about no-shows. \nMeanwhile, Public Health England said on Tuesday that it was investigating a new coronavirus variant previously reported by the Philippines, after two cases were identified in England. \nIt said one case was linked with international travel, while the other was still under investigation.\nPHE also said that two cases of the P.1 variant of concern first found in Brazil had been identified in England - with one in the West Midlands and another in Haringey, London.\nThis variant has a mutation - known as E484 - that means it can escape some of the immune response, which may mean vaccines work less effectively against it.\nBoth cases were linked with international travel to Brazil, PHE said, and bring the total number of UK cases of the variant to 12."

      "tags": "NI education,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All post-primary staff and year 12 -14 pupils are to get twice-weekly lateral flow tests from next week, the NI Health Minister has said.\nIn a letter seen by BBC News NI, Mr Weir said that after the Easter break the programme will expand to include all primary school staff.\nPupils will be supervised for the first two tests in schools. \nMr Weir said he hoped the executive would soon confirm the phasing of schools re-opening.\nIn a letter to all schools, Mr Weir said: \"It is very much my intention that all pupils return to the classroom as soon as possible.\n\"With all of the measures schools have taken to comply with departmental guidance on operation during Covid, I reiterate that schools are safe environments.  \n\"The reason that we moved to remote learning after Christmas was because of the high level of community transmission, and the urgent need to reduce all social contact,\" he added.\nAll testing will be voluntary.\nMr Weir said that while there might be \"challenges\" the tests would add a further level of Covid security to the school setting.  \nThe department is using a self-test Lateral Flow Device (LFD) which provides a result within 30 minutes. \nThe initial batch will be delivered to post-primary schools in the coming days, meaning all post-primaries will have enough tests to conduct at least one supervised test in school, and for pupils to be able to conduct a test before they return after the Easter break.  \nMr Weir said he had read some reports concerning the effectiveness of the lateral-flow test test and the possibility of \"false positives\".\n\"No test is completely accurate, but studies indicate a very high degree of effectiveness at detecting those who are infectious,\" he said.  \n\"When infection levels are low in the community, a positive LFD test indicates that the individual may have Covid,\" he added. \nHe said this should be confirmed by a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test done in a Covid testing centre.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the tests were \"important as an additional measure alongside the range of existing safety measures in place to help ensure the safety of staff and pupils in schools\".\nTesting for school staff, including teaching and support staff, and pupils will be twice weekly three to four days apart using LFD tests.  \nOlder students in years 12-14 are included as prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher among this group, the department said. \nMr Weir said the testing programme will \"provide reassurance for pupils and teachers that the risk of large groups of exam year classes having to isolate during this important period, will be considerably reduced\".\nThe plan has three phases. \nThey and their household must isolate immediately.  \nIn-school contacts are not required to isolate at this stage.  The individual must then take a PCR test. \nIf the PCR test is negative they, and their household, can stop isolating and return to school. \nIf the PCR test result is positive the individual and their household and all other close contacts must complete a full 10 days of self-isolation.

      "text": "Hartlepool Labour MP Mike Hill has resigned \"with immediate effect\", prompting a by-election.\nMr Hill was due to face an employment tribunal later this year into claims of \"sexual harassment and victimisation\". He has denied the allegations.\nShadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said there was an ongoing investigation relating to his resignation that the party took \"very seriously\".\nMr Hill, 57, had served as the MP for the town since 2017.\nLabour held Hartlepool at the 2019 General Election, when the Conservatives came second by fewer than 4,000 votes. \nThe by-election could be held on 6 May to coincide with local and mayoral elections in England, and will pose the first electoral test of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership since taking over from Jeremy Corbyn last year.\nThe constituency Labour Party said it wanted a candidate in place \"quickly\".\nIn September 2019, Mr Hill was suspended from the party following an accusation of sexual harassment. \nThat was later dropped, he had the whip restored and took the seat in the December election.\nSpeaking in October 2019, Mr Hill said he \"completely rejected\" the allegations and it had been a \"very difficult time\" for his family, friends and staff.\nBy David Macmillan, BBC Radio Tees political reporter\nThe upcoming by-election will be framed as the first litmus test of Sir Keir Starmer's Labour leadership.\nBut politics in the North East coastal town can be more labyrinthine than a simple popularity contest between Labour and Conservative.\nHartlepool gave the Brexit Party its first council leadership, when a group of Independent councillors switched allegiance in September 2019 only to revert to being independents four months later.\nIt famously elected its football club mascot H'Angus the Monkey as mayor in 2002 and re-elected the man in the costume, Stuart Drummond, twice more before the post was abolished.\nQuestions about how this by-election will play out provide intrigue. \nWho will claim the 10,000 votes cast for the Brexit Party at the 2019 General Election?\nHas the local Labour Party - so riven with in-fighting it lost control of Hartlepool Council before a vote was cast in 2019 - been able to restore order sufficiently to mount a robust defence of the seat?\nWill big regional announcements like the Teesside Freeport or Darlington's treasury campus send voters towards the Tories?\nHow will a rare all-out council election affect the poll, if it does take place on the same day?\nIt's going to be fascinating, but then politics in Hartlepool frequently is. \nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "title": "Oliver Campbell: Calls to review 30-year-old murder conviction",
      "tags": "Crime,Criminal justice system",
      "text": "A man with learning difficulties who admitted to a murder 30 years ago should have his conviction quashed because he confessed to police without a lawyer present, his solicitor says.\nOliver Campbell's confession would be ruled inadmissible today, Arthur Mullinger told BBC Newsnight.\nCampbell, who was 19 at the time, says he was \"put under pressure\" to \"admit to something that I didn't do\".\nPolice say the interviews were fair, while a judge ruled them admissible.\nMr Mullinger believes officers failed to tell him that his client - who was accused of shooting dead a London shopkeeper - had waived his right to a solicitor because they realised that he would try to change Campbell's mind.\nHe told Newsnight: \"The police did not have anything like sufficient evidence, probably even to get a prosecution off the ground, let alone a conviction without something more. And the more was going to be a confession.\"\nCampbell, 50, who suffered a brain injury when he was eight months old, has always protested his innocence and has been fighting his conviction for many years. He was released from prison on life licence in 2002.\nOn 22 July 1990, two men entered a shop in east London intent on robbery. The owner, 42-year-old Baldev Hoondle, pressed a panic alarm before one of the men pulled out a gun and shot him in the head at close range.\nNewsnight approached Mr Hoondle's family but they did not wish to participate in the programme.\nCampbell - a local teenager - was arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder and brought in for questioning at Hackney police station.\nOn 1 December 1990, Mr Mullinger attended a police interview with his client alongside an appropriate adult from social services who was there because the police accepted that Campbell was mentally vulnerable.\nMr Mullinger and the appropriate adult left at around 6.30pm thinking interviews were over for the day, with Mr Mullinger saying that police officers had agreed to call him back if that changed.\nThe police say Campbell then decided to confess to murder and had waived his right to a solicitor.\nOfficers then brought his foster mother in to the police station and she agreed to become the appropriate adult for the new interview, which went ahead without Mr Mullinger's knowledge.\nHe told Newsnight he was misled and believes the police realised that getting a confession would be less likely if Campbell was legally represented.\nHe said: \"The officer should have telephoned me and said, 'I think Oliver wants to speak to me. Will you come over to be part of the interview?' And I would have said, 'yes, of course'\u2026 And we would have had the interview. \n\"I don't know how that interview would have panned out, but it would have been undoubtedly a fair interview.\" \nCampbell's foster mother, who was a magistrate, was so shocked by his confession to murder that she was physically sick. She said at the time that she felt manipulated by the police.\nNewsnight obtained the original tapes of the police interviews conducted and traced the senior officer who interviewed Campbell in 1990.\nThe officer, who the BBC is choosing not to name, denies that the interview was unfair and told Newsnight he suspects Campbell is \"in denial of murder\", adding: \"When he was interviewed by me, he had the assistance of a solicitor or an appropriate adult to look after him... \n\"It is correct he did not have a solicitor present when he confessed. However, his appropriate adult was present throughout and he had waived his right to have his solicitor.\"\nHe added: \"His interview tape recordings were played at his trial and the jury had ample opportunity to consider whether or not his confession was genuine\", and said this was \"not the only evidence which incriminated him\".\nThe officer said the interviews were tape recorded and conducted in accordance with the Codes of Practice issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which applied at that time.\nBut Mr Mullinger and Campbell's current legal team say his conviction should be quashed because the confession would be ruled inadmissible today.\nGlyn Maddocks and Michael Birnbaum have been fighting to clear Campbell's name for the past 20 years.\nMr Maddocks said: \"Oliver Campbell is a mentally disabled person who was no match for a group of experienced and manipulative police officers. \n\"The 'admissions' Oliver made were inconsistent, varied noticeably from the evidence and in some places were quite absurd.\"\nMr Birnbaum QC said: \"I can't prove this - this is a strong suspicion [but] I think they realised that they were never going to get an admission from him if a solicitor was present.\"\nCampbell's confession statements were ruled admissible at his trial in 1991. Mr Birnbaum QC told Newsnight: \"The trial judge conducted a hearing about whether to admit that statement - declare it admissible - and said that there had been no impropriety by the police. \n\"But I don't believe the defence counsel brought up any of these to my mind pretty obvious points that could be made about the unfairness of the police conduct.\"\nThe prosecution relied on three main strands of evidence apart from Campbell's confession: \nBut Campbell's lawyers say his confession was key, and there was no solicitor present for that.\nCampbell was released from prison after serving 11 years in 2002 and is now living in sheltered accommodation in Suffolk. He is still a convicted murderer, a label he says is ruining his life. \nHe told Newsnight that the police questioning was unfair, adding: \"I was put under pressure\u2026 to say things that I didn't want to say at the end of the day\u2026 to admit to something that I didn't do. And I felt scared at the time.\"\nSome of the police interview tactics were later described by an independent psychologist as \"highly manipulative and relentless\", while one of the questions lasted almost three minutes.\nThe case is now being reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for the second time. In 2005, it decided not to refer it back to the Court of Appeal. A key reason for this was that it argued that many of the apparent weaknesses in evidence had already been considered by the courts.\nMr Birnbaum QC says there are fresh grounds today, both on the detail of the evidence and the circumstances surrounding Campbell's confession. \nHe said: \"The law and practise in regard to the way that mentally challenged suspects and defendants are treated has changed very considerably in their favour. \n\"Today his interviews would never be heard by a jury because of the unfairness of the police questioning and because I don't think the prosecution could prove that he understood the implications of being interviewed without a solicitor.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"The case was fully investigated at the time with a range of evidence brought before a jury who convicted the defendant in 1991. \n\"We are aware this matter is with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.\"\nWatch the full report on Newsnight at 22:45 GMT on Tuesday 16 March on BBC 2 or later on iPlayer."

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,UK defence spending,Boris Johnson,Ministry of Defence,Ben Wallace",
      "text": "The British army is already the smallest it's been in 400 years. And it's about to get even smaller.\nA cut in the number of troops is expected in a defence review, due to be published next month.\nOptions include losing up to 10,000 soldiers from the regular Army's notional strength of 82,000 in order to help fund its modernisation. \nMinisters have made clear there will still have to be painful decisions for the armed forces, despite the extra \u00a316.5bn given to the Ministry of Defence over the next four years.\nA senior Army officer has told the BBC that technology will allow the Army to become \"leaner and more agile\". \nBut it comes amid warnings that the Army is already too small, and that more cuts will worry allies and limit its ability to fight.\nOver the past year the Army has been preparing for a radical transformation. \nIt wants to embrace new technologies - from drones and robots to artificial intelligence. \nBrig John Clark, the head of Army strategy, insists no decision on troop numbers has yet been made. \nBut he says by harnessing technology \"you're able to achieve the same effect with fewer people\".\nHowever, Jack Watling, of London's Royal United Services Institute warns of \"the excitement of new capabilities coming at the expense of traditional hard military power\". \nRemember, the majority of soldiers in a modern army are there to support and sustain a fighting force. \nThe tip of the spear, the combat element, is often about a third of an army's total strength. \nThe rumours in Whitehall suggest the Army will be losing several infantry battalions, part of the fighting force.\nMr Watling says an army of just 72,000 should still be able to take and hold \"a small town\", bearing in mind the British army struggled to secure the Iraqi city of Basra, when it was 100,000 strong.\nIt might appear to be a contradiction, but the Army believes even if it's smaller, it can still have a bigger presence around the world. \nIt's embraced the government's mantra of \"global Britain\".  \nFor the Army it'll mean operating from a number of \"global hubs\" in parts of the world where it already has a presence - such as Kenya, Oman and Brunei. \nBrig Clark says: \"We see those as launchpads through which we can routinely send more of the British army out to train, develop and demonstrate.\"\nHe says by being forward-deployed the Army will be able to respond and manage threats \"more rapidly and decisively\". \nHe describes it as prevention rather than cure.\nIt signals a shift in the way the Army wants to operate. \nBrig Clark talks of \"smaller teams that can go out there and compete beneath the threshold of conflict\" - the so-called \"grey zone\" where militaries operate discreetly in the blurred lines between war and peace.\nBen Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: \"I see a clear aspiration to do more with the Army further away, but forces cannot be everywhere at once.\"\nThere are certainly questions as to whether a smaller army, spread around the world, will be able to meet its existing commitments to Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). \nIn theory, the UK can deploy a war fighting division to defend Europe.  \nMr Watling of Rusi says among the components of a division would be around 200 main battle tanks. \nThe British army is likely to have half that number.\nMr Barry, of the IISS, says allies in eastern Europe are left wondering whether the British army of the future will be sending \"armour and infantry or aggressive algorithms\" to help defend them.\nThe Army's plans do include updating increasingly obsolete armoured vehicles and the addition of more potent long-range artillery systems. \nBrig Clark insists the Army will still be able to field a warfighting division. \nBut the Army's definition of a division appears to be changing.\nThe UK already has one of the smallest armies of any major European nation. \nAnd that worries its closest military ally, the United States. \nUS General Mark Milley's plea to the British army at a London conference just a few years ago was that \"you don't get any smaller\". \nKim Darroch, the former British ambassador to Washington, recently said the message from the Pentagon was \"\u2026do not go down any further and expect to retain your current credibility\".\nThe truth is that the British Army's credibility had already been damaged in the eyes of the US. \nAmerica had to come to the rescue of the British army in both Iraq and Afghanistan. \nMr Barry and Mr Watling also question whether an army of 72,000 could do another Helmand - a long, enduring campaign.\nBrig Clark insists it could.  \nBut the British army has a recent history of biting off more than it can chew."

      "text": "Mark Rees and his wife Katy run a chain of gift shops with the Thorntons name in big letters above the door.\nAnd they pay \u00a37,000 a year for the privilege.\nSo imagine their shock when the chocolate maker told them it would be issuing a global press release announcing its plans to close all of its 61 stores.\nWhat that announcement didn't say is that Thorntons' more than 100 franchisees - who, together, account for the bulk of its High Street presence - have no intention of closing.\nIn a subsequent statement to the BBC, Thorntons said: \"We proactively communicated with all our franchise partners this morning to reassure them that we remain committed to supporting them and continuing to supply their business with our Thorntons range.\" \nBut the couple have faced questions from staff who thought they were losing their jobs and customers who thought their shops would not reopen after lockdowns are lifted.\nFor Mark, it is the latest blow in a relationship that has seen him \"rode roughshod over\" for 15 years by Thorntons.\nHis parents started the chain of shops 30 years ago when they spent tens of thousands of pounds to become a Thorntons partner.\nAnd it wasn't easy. To this day the chocolate maker has absolute say over what lighting Mark uses to illuminate its products and even what he puts on the floor in front of them.\nBut for his parents, it was worth it. Then, Mark says, it was a privilege to stock Thorntons products and it made their stores a destination for chocolate lovers.\nBut that changed in 2004, shortly after Mark took over the business.\nThe chocolate maker took its franchise partners by surprise by announcing that it would start selling its products in supermarkets and beyond. That meant Thorntons' loyal customers could get their Continental Selection boxes elsewhere - and for less.\nWhile Mark says he had to adhere to strict rules about how the product was displayed and how much he could charge, those same boxes were being \"bunged on to shelves\" at petrol stations and discount retailers.\n\"And yet, we are actually policed,\" Mark says. \"We could have our franchise agreement taken away, if we do not abide by the rules of the contract.\"\n\"They've ruled by fear in many ways,\" he says.\nMeanwhile, Mark was able to walk into Wilko and buy Thorntons products for less than he was paying to the chocolate maker itself. \n\"It's damaging for us because customers see us as expensive, but we just simply cannot afford to sell the product any cheaper,\" Mark says.\nLast year, he was selling Easter eggs for \u00a38 that he was buying from Thorntons for \u00a35. At Wilko, that same egg was being sold for \u00a33.\nThat meant Mark was often forced to stock up at the discount retailer, rather than his \"supposed partner\", which is how he refers to Thorntons.\n\"You can imagine the damage and the hurt that that causes you,\" he says.\nKaty thinks the franchise partners, who are often family-run businesses that helped build the Thorntons brand in the 90s, have been \"completely forgotten and now left to fight for their survival\".\nMeanwhile, she accuses Thorntons of \"flooding\" supermarket shelves with its chocolates and cheapening the brand that franchisees like her and Mark pay so much to buy in to.\nAs a result, the couple have decided to rebrand their stores to Henry & Co, named after their son.\n\"We have decided that the alliances that we have with these brands, is actually damaging us and not benefiting us at all,\" Mark says.\n\"We're going to break away from the shackles of dealing with these big brands and the onerous contracts and constraints that that brings with it.\"\nA Thorntons spokeswoman said: \"In addition to our own retail estate, we work closely with around 100 other franchise stores that sell Thorntons product within a broader retail store environment - such as cards stores, gift stores and post offices.\"\n\"Our franchise partners, alongside our grocery partners and e-commerce, remain a key part of our strategy for the future of Thorntons. The Thorntons website store locator will continue to reflect the franchise stores available to customers.\" "

      "text": "Yaphet Kotto, best known for playing a villain in 1973 James Bond movie Live and Let Die, has died at the age of 81.\nThe actor also played a crew member in 1979 sci-fi movie Alien, and starred in US TV police drama Homicide: Life on the Street.\nKotto's other credits included the 1980s action films The Running Man and Midnight Run. \nHe also received an Emmy nomination for playing former Ugandan President Idi Amin in the 1977 movie Raid on Entebbe.\nHis TV career also included roles in the A-Team and Law and Order, and he played Lieutenant Al Giardello in seven series of the gritty Homicide: Life on the Street, for which he also worked as a scriptwriter.\nHe died on Monday in the Philippines, his wife Sinahon Thessa said on Facebook. \"You played a villain on some of your movies but for me you're a real hero and to a lot of people also,\" she wrote.\n\"A good man, a good father, a good husband and a decent human being, very rare to find. One of the best actors in Hollywood, a Legend. Rest in Peace Honey, I'm gonna miss you everyday, my best friend, my rock.\"\nTributes came from Hollywood figures including Ava DuVernay, who said he was \"one of those actors who deserved more than the parts he got\", and fellow director Edgar Wright, who described him as \"a brilliant magnetic presence\".\nKotto was born in New York to a Cameroonian immigrant father and a US Army nurse, and studied acting from the age of 16. At 19, he made his professional theatre debut in Othello, and later performed on Broadway in The Great White Hope.\nHis first few film projects included Nothing But a Man in 1964 and The Thomas Crown Affair in 1968. \nKotto drew plaudits for his role as the first black Bond villain Dr Kananga - an evil Caribbean diplomat whose alter ego was a New York drug lord - in Live and Let Die, starring Roger Moore. \nKotto then had roles in 1974's Truck Turner and 1978's Blue Collar. In Ridley Scott's Alien, he took the role of the space ship's engineer Dennis Parker.\nFollowing the film's success, Kotto turned down a role in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back because he was wary of becoming typecast in the sci-fi genre. \n\"I wanted to get back down on Earth,\" he said in an interview. \"I was afraid that if I did another space film after having done Alien, then I'd be typed.\n\"Once you get one of those big blockbuster hits, you better have some other big blockbuster hits to go with it too and be Harrison Ford, because if you don't\u2026 you place yourself right out of the business.\"\nHe also said he turned down the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the character made famous by Sir Patrick Stewart in Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\"I should have done that, but I walked away,\" he admitted in 2015. \"When you're making movies, you'd tend to say no to TV. It's like when you're in college and someone asks you to the high school dance. You say no.\"\nKotto went on to play a supporting role in Brubaker in 1980, and then appear as a resistance fighter alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987's The Running Man, and as an FBI agent in Robert De Niro's Midnight Run the following year. \nHis other film credits also included Bill Cosby's Man and Boy (1971), Across 110th Street (1972), Report to the Commissioner (1975), The Star Chamber (1983), Warning Sign (1985), Eye of the Tiger (1986) and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991).\nKotto's other TV roles included appearances in For Love and Honor, Murder She Wrote and Death Valley Days. \nMost recently, he reprised his role as Lieutenant Giardello in Homicide: The Movie in 2000, and voiced his Alien character Parker in the Alien: Isolation video game. \nKotto is survived by six children and had been married three times.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "France,Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Countries around Europe are seeking further clarification on the safety of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, amid criticism of their decision to suspend giving the jab.\nFrance, Germany, Spain and Italy have said they are awaiting an investigation by the EU's regulator into reports of clots in a small number of recipients.\nBut other EU members, including Poland and Belgium, are continuing its use.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) will release its findings on Thursday.  \nOn Tuesday, the EMA said it was still \"firmly convinced\" of the benefits of the AstraZeneca drug. Its head, Emer Cooke, pointed out that blood clots highlighted by some countries were relatively common in the general population. \n\"I want to stress at present there is no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions,\" she said.\nIn a joint statement later on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the EMA's comments were \"encouraging\".\nMeanwhile, experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) were also meeting on Tuesday but a spokesman stressed there was \"no evidence\" that the reported blood clots were linked to the vaccine. \nThe WHO has urged countries not to pause their vaccinations. The suspensions come as much of Europe struggles to control rising cases.\nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring.\nSome 13 European countries have paused their use of the vaccine. Denmark was first, followed by Norway and Iceland. Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Spain, Latvia and Sweden are the latest to follow suit.\nOn Monday, the three largest EU members - Germany, France and Italy - said they were awaiting the results of the EMA investigation before deciding whether to resume their rollout of the jab.\nThey said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\"We expect some kind of verdict from the European scientific community by Thursday afternoon, allowing us to resume the campaign,\" French Health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said on Tuesday.\n\"There were a few very unusual and troubling cases which justify this pause and the analysis,\" French immunologist Alain Fischer, who heads a government advisory board, told France Inter radio. \"It's not lost time.\"\nIn Germany, the health ministry also pointed to a small number of rare blood clots in vaccinated people when justifying its decision. It has postponed a summit on extending the vaccine rollout ahead of the EMA's expected announcement on Thursday.\nThere is as yet no evidence that the specified clots were linked to the vaccine, and the EMA has said other factors are likely behind the incidents.\nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the AstraZeneca drug, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer the vaccine.\nThe decision to halt rollouts of the AstraZeneca vaccine has been criticised by some politicians and doctors. \nKarl Lauterbach, a German epidemiologist and health spokesman for the centre-left Social Democrats, said while the pause was justifiable, it was also political. \n\"I would even now get vaccinated with the AstraZeneca. Based on the incidents we now know, the benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the risks, particularly for the elderly,\" he told Deutschlandfunk radio. \nA spokeswoman for Germany's opposition Free Democrats said the decision had set back the country's entire vaccination rollout. German Greens health expert Janosch Dahmen, meanwhile, argued that authorities could have continued using the drug. \nAnd Poland's vaccination head Michal Dworczyk said countries that have paused their use of the drug \"have succumbed to the panic caused by media coverage of alleged complications\".\nThe intense divisions over the AstraZeneca jab come as much of the continent is struggling to contain a surge in coronavirus cases. \nThe rise has led many countries to tighten restrictions, and there are concerns over the pace of Europe's vaccination drive which has already been affected by supply shortages. \nGerman infections are growing \"exponentially\", with cases up by 20% in the past week, an expert from the RKI public health agency warned on Tuesday.\nWhile in France, Prime Minister Jean Castex said the widespread prevalence of three Covid-19 variants meant the country was now in \"a sort of third wave\".\n\"The outbreak is going into extra time,\" he told parliament on Tuesday.\nNorway's capital, Oslo, has announced tougher restrictions, while Italy and the Netherlands are both enforcing lockdowns.\nSome 575,000 people in the European Union have died as a result of coronavirus, and the pandemic has taken a major economic toll."

      "text": "Bakery chain Greggs is to open 100 new shops in 2021 as it bets on a post-pandemic recovery.\nThis is despite the chain reporting its first loss for 36 years in 2020 after sales fell by a third amid coronavirus lockdown measures.\nGreggs said it had ramped up deliveries, wholesale, and click-and-collect as High Street sales fell.\nChief executive Roger Whiteside added that Greggs had \"made a better-than-expected start to 2021\".\nHe added that the chain was \"well placed to participate in the recovery from the pandemic\".\nSales at company-managed shops fell by more than 36% last year as footfall in city centres and travel hub sites fell substantially during lockdowns.\nThis was partly offset by deliveries through Just Eat, which is one of the world's biggest food delivery platforms.\nGreggs reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a313.7m, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984.\nNevertheless, the chain is planning to open about 100 net new shops this year, adding to the 2,078 it already operates.\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pandemic \"tore a huge chunk off business as it turned once bustling city centres into ghost towns\".\n\"Although the crisis is likely to prove a temporary interruption to our insatiable demand for sausage rolls rather than a sign of dramatically changing tastes, it is quite a sustained break, and it's going to take a toll. Greggs has previously said it doesn't expect a return to pre-Covid levels of operations until 2022 at the earliest.\"\nJohn Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: \"The High Street is likely to be a very different place when lockdown restrictions are fully ended, with many empty spaces and chains such as Pret re-focusing on suburban areas - the traditional heartland of Greggs.\n\"While these factors cannot be underestimated, the company is in good shape, with a solid balance sheet, and has a great record of rising to the challenge.\"\nGreggs chairman Ian Durant said 2020 was \"not the year that any of us planned for\".\nHe said the firm had started the year strongly but then temporarily closed its shops in March due to the Covid outbreak. It then reopened shops in the middle of the year.\nTo get through the pandemic, Greggs arranged financing both from the government, which it has since repaid, and from lenders.\n\"Government support has been essential to mitigate the impact of Covid and protect as many jobs as possible through this period,\" Mr Durant said.\nHe said it had been \"sad to say goodbye\" to staff whose roles had been cut by the firm \"to reflect the reality of the trading environment\"."

      "tags": "Islamist extremism,Mozambique,Islamic State group",
      "text": "A leading aid agency says that children as young as 11 are being beheaded in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province.\nOne mother told Save the Children she had to watch her 12-year-old son killed in this way close to where she was hiding with her other children.\nMore than 2,500 people have been killed and 700,000 have fled their homes since the insurgency began in 2017.\nMilitants linked to the Islamic State (IS) group are behind a conflict in the province.\nIn its report, Save the Children did not specify who was behind the attacks, but it said that displaced people had reported gruesome scenes in the gas-rich northern province which borders Tanzania.\nOne mother, whose name was withheld to protect her identity, said her eldest child had been beheaded near where she and her other children were hiding. \n\"That night our village was attacked and houses were burned,\" she said.\n\"When it all started, I was at home with my four children. We tried to escape to the woods but they took my eldest son and beheaded him. We couldn't do anything because we would be killed too.\"\nAnother woman said her son had been killed by militants while she and her other three children had been forced to flee.\n\"After my 11-year-old son was killed, we understood that it was no longer safe to stay in my village,\" she said.\n\"We fled to my father's house in another village, but a few days later the attacks started there too.\"\nChance Briggs, Save the Children's country director in Mozambique, said the reports of attacks on children \"sicken us to our core\".\n\"Our staff have been brought to tears when hearing the stories of suffering told by mothers in displacement camps,\" he said. \nThe United Nations special rapporteur on extra-judicial executions described the militants' actions as \"cruel beyond words\".\nThe insurgents are known locally as al-Shabab, which means The Youth in Arabic. This reflects that it receives its support mostly from young unemployed people in the predominantly Muslim region of Cabo Delgado.\nA group with a similar name has existed in Somalia for more than a decade. It is affiliated to al-Qaeda, unlike the Mozambican group which allied itself with the rival IS movement in 2019.\nIS sees the insurgents as being part of what it calls its Central Africa Province. It released images last year showing fighters in Cabo Delgado with AK-47 rifles and rocket propelled grenades.\nThis alarmed counter-terrorism experts, as it suggested that global jihadists were exploiting a local insurgency for their own gains. \nSome analysts believe the insurgency's roots lay in socio-economic grievances, with many locals complaining that they have benefited little from the province's ruby and gas industries.\nIn a video last year, one militant leader said: \"We occupy [the towns] to show that the government of the day is unfair. It humiliates the poor and gives the profit to the bosses.\"\nThe man spoke about Islam and his desire for an \"Islamic government, not a government of unbelievers\", but he also cited alleged abuses by Mozambique's military, and repeatedly complained that the government was \"unfair\".\nMr Briggs told the BBC World Service it was difficult to determine their exact motivations as they did not have a manifesto. \n\"They co-opt young people in to joining them as conscripts and if they refuse they are killed and sometimes beheaded. It's really hard to see what is the end game.\"\nAfter visiting Cabo Delgado's capital Pemba last year, a delegation from the South African Bishop's Conference said that \"almost everyone spoken to agrees that the war is about multinational corporations gaining control of the province's mineral and gas resources\".\nCabo Delgado is one of the poorest provinces in Mozambique, with high rates of illiteracy and unemployment. \nDiscoveries of a huge ruby deposit and a giant gas field in 2009-10, raised hopes of jobs and a better life for many local people, but those hopes were soon dashed.\nIt was alleged that any benefits were being taken by a small elite in the Frelimo party, which has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975.\nNew Islamist preachers, both East Africans and Mozambicans trained abroad, established mosques and argued that local imams were allied to Frelimo and its grab for wealth.\nSome of these new mosques provided money to help local people start business and create jobs - and the Islamists argued the society would be fairer under Sharia.\nThis proved attractive to youth, who form the backbone of the insurgency.\nIts main focus is on seeking a military solution, but its army is poorly equipped to combat the insurgency. \nOn Monday, US embassy officials in the capital, Maputo, said American military personnel would spend two months training soldiers, as well as providing \"medical and communications equipment\".\nThe European Union also announced last year that it would provide training to Mozambican forces. \nTheir intervention follows reports that Mozambique had recruited Russian and South African mercenaries to help fight the militants. However, the Russian mercenaries are reported to have withdrawn from Cabo Delgado after sustaining losses at the hands of the insurgents.\nNo, they briefly seized the strategic port of Mocimboa da Praia and another important town, Quissanga, last year.\nSeveral cross-border attacks were carried out on villages in neighbouring Tanzania's gas-rich region of Mtwara last year.

      "text": "Chocolate maker Thorntons has said none of its stores will reopen after coronavirus lockdowns are lifted.\nThe decision to close its 61 shops will put more than 600 jobs at risk.\nThe company said it had been badly hit by the pandemic, which forced its stores to shut their doors during the crucial Christmas and Easter holidays.\n\"The obstacles we have faced and will continue to face on the High Street are too severe,\" said Thorntons retail director Adam Goddard.\n\"Despite our best efforts we have taken the difficult decision to permanently close our retail store estate.\"\nThorntons has been on the High Street for more than a century but these days history isn't enough to guarantee survival. \nIt was losing its way in the early 2000s with newer players, like Hotel Chocolat, entering the scene. It also embarked on a strategy of selling more chocolates through supermarkets and closing unprofitable shops. \nItalian food giant Ferrero bought the business in 2015 and has been trying to turn it around ever since. Over the last five years, it's shrunk from 252 to 61 stores. \nBut Ferrero has now thrown in the towel on Thorntons stores altogether, betting that the brand's future is now online and on the supermarket shelves. \nThis pandemic has created brutal trading conditions for so many traditional retailers. And the high street shakeout is still far from over. \nThorntons said it had spent \u00a345m transforming the business with changes to the way stores operate and the introduction of new cafes but its plans had been thrown off course by the pandemic.\nThe company, which was founded in Sheffield in 1911, said it would continue to sell its chocolate online and try to sell more through supermarkets.\nSince the beginning of the crisis, sales through its website have increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year, it said. \nIt will also try to expand the range of products made at its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire and increase international sales.\nIn 2011, Thorntons announced plans to massively reduce the number of stores it had on the High Street and in shopping centres.\nIt said it would close up to 180 of the 364 stores it had at the time, following a strategic review.\nSince then, the number of stores has dwindled to 61.\nIn 2015, Italian food giant Ferrero bought the chocolate chain for \u00a3112m.\nIn a statement, the company said: \"We remain committed to this iconic British brand and will continue to invest further in the future potential of Thorntons to ensure we evolve with the times.\"\nThorntons is just the latest well-known name to suffer the impact that rolling lockdowns have had on the High Street as more people take to shopping online.\nMore than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to figures from the Local Data Company. That is an average rate of 48 closures a day.\nLast week, department store chain John Lewis announced plans to close more stores.  Other casualties have included PSir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, which included Topshop and Dorothy Perkins.\nAre you a Thorntons employee?

      "text": "Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars.\nVanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees.\nIt's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nAnd two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history.\nChloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman.\nOther nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman.\nMank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations.\nThis year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station.\nThe eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination.\nAt 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.\nColman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father.\nCarey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director.\nKirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively.\nOther British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.\nSix black actors and actresses are nominated, equalling the record set in 2017. This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song.\nDavis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever.\nAhmed is the first actor of Pakistani descent to get an Oscar nomination and the first Muslim to be up for best actor; and Yuh-Jung Youn is the first South Korean actress to get an Oscar nod. \n\"Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!\" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor.\nMinari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers. Its rivals for that award include Judas and the Black Messiah, which is the first best picture nominee to have an all-black line-up of producers.\nBoseman is nominated alongside Davis for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - his final role before he died of cancer at the age of 43 last year.\nThe much-loved star, who is also known for his role in Black Panther, is the favourite to be given the best actor award.\nIf he does, he will be only the second posthumous best actor winner after Peter Finch for Network in 1976.\nOnly five women had been nominated for best director before, and only one has won - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010.\nThis year, two of the five contenders are female, with Chinese-born, US-based Zhao the hot favourite for her story of a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who lives a nomadic life in a van.\nZhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night.\nFennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year.\nOverall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards.\nThe 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy.\n\"I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,\" she said.\nHer previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year?\nProbably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel.\nPlus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance.\nMank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture.\nCrucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. \nIt has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited.\nMank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves.\nIt would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley.\nI have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination. "

Do not socialise outside your family or your bubble, and we particularly want to say to young people that you need to follow the rules and the advice.\"\nShe said the decision to prioritise education was important for children to \"build and grow their friendship networks, to be able to socialise and grow their own interests and future potential\".\n\"The weather is improving and we have been in this current lockdown for around 80 days,\" added the first minister.\n\"That is a long time and a big ask, and we have been so grateful to everyone who has made a personal contribution to the improvement in the Covid situation.   \nMrs Foster acknowledged some people would be disappointed their sectors had not yet been given dates to reopen.\n\"We have focused on outdoor settings where the risk is relatively lower than indoor settings,\" she added.\nThe Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey also appealed for a quiet day. \nOn Tuesday she met representatives of Belfast City Council, local elected representatives, the PSNI, and Ulster and Queen's Universities, to discuss plans in place to prevent large gatherings in the Holylands area of Belfast.\n\"This year it is more important than ever that those who live in the Holylands and surrounding areas adhere to public health guidelines.  \n\"Breaches of those guidelines are completely unacceptable,\" she said.\nThe executive has also agreed to increase the provision for elite sports from March 25 March to allow a number of new competitions to begin.\nMrs Foster said the \"minor adjustment\" to the restrictions would allow two World Cup qualification matches scheduled for 25 and 31 March to take place as well as a friendly match between NI and the USA on 28 March. \nNo spectators will be permitted at any sporting event. \nStormont's health minister said it was vitally important that a \"free-for-all\" situation was avoided as restrictions eased.\nIn a paper for the Stormont Executive, Robin Swann said he continued to recommend a gradual approach.\nThere pandemic had resulted in \"increased harmful alcohol consumption, more snacking and increased sedentary behaviour\", he added.\nCommenting on the reopening of schools Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Children and Young People said she was \"pleased with a tinge of frustration\" about the move.\nKoulla Yiasouma told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that many primary school staff had been preparing for further remote learning, in the absence of clarity from the executive.\nDr Tom Black, chair of BMA Northern Ireland Council, said it was \"extremely important\" for children to return to school for their educational and social development as well as their mental health.\nHe said it was also very important that any easing of restrictions was done in a safe way.\nSport NI welcomed what it called \"the first cautious steps towards a return to outdoor sport\".\nUlster GAA said the organisation's Covid advisory group will issue updated guidance following news that groups of up to 15 people will be able to train together from 12 April.\nIt said clubs in Northern Ireland must stress to players and management teams that \"12 April is the earliest date that they may be permitted to resume activity\".\nReacting to the news about click and collect services Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was a \"much-needed lifeline to those struggling independent retailers\".\nThe chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, also called for indicative dates and clarity. \n\"At the very least, the data behind reopening decisions should be published,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, one death was reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 2,100.\nA further 164 cases of the virus were also confirmed.\nThere are 176 inpatients currently being treated for coronavirus in Northern Ireland, with 18 in intensive care.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Department of Health has reported 18 further Covid-related deaths and 349 new cases. Seventeen deaths occurred in March and one in February.\nIt brings the total number of deaths in the Republic of Ireland to 4,552 and the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases stands at 227,663.\nIn Northern Ireland, tough coronavirus restrictions were initially imposed on 26 December, in a bid to curb a rise in cases of Covid-19.\nThere have been some adjustments to the rules but households are generally still not allowed to mix indoors, pubs, cafes and restaurants remain closed except for takeaway, and most shops are shut.\nIn Northern Ireland, P1 to P3 pupils returned to the classroom last Monday, as did nursery and pre-school children.\nLast week, the executive ditched a previous plan for those pupils to go back to remote learning on 22 March when some secondary schoolchildren, year groups 12 to 14, are due to return to school.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir had been pushing for all remaining pupils to return as soon as possible and two weeks notice would have been preferable.\n\"My preference would have been that earlier decisions were taken,\" he said.\n\"That has to be weighed up against the wider public health situation and also a desire from the executive as a whole to try to take this in the context of a strategic decision in relation to that.\"\nMr Weir said it was important to get children back to school as soon as possible.\nVulnerable children and children of key workers have had access to schools for supervised learning since January, and special schools remained open as usual.\nSchools in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have all reopened on a wider basis."

      "text": "People aged 50 or over in Northern Ireland can now book their Covid-19 vaccine appointment, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.\nThose who are eligible and wish to receive the vaccine can booking it online or be contacted by their GPs.\nBooking slots are available at the seven regional vaccination centres.\nThere was some frustration about the length of time some people were having to wait in the queue to book their slot on Monday.\nHowever, Mr Swann told the assembly that in the first three hours of the slots opening 30,000 people had booked vaccines. \nThe centres will primarily be using the AstraZeneca vaccine for first doses, to maximise available vaccine supplies.\nAnyone who received the Pfizer vaccine as a first dose will still receive the Pfizer vaccine for their second dose.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister told the assembly that the \"benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks\".\nIt comes after health officials in Northern Ireland said they would continue to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after its suspension in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe temporary suspension of the vaccine is already having an impact on the republic's immunisation programme. \nAbout 30,000 vaccination appointments for health staff and those at high-risk might be delayed, according to RT\u00c9.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly described its move as \"precautionary\", after reports of serious blood clotting events in adults in Norway. \nAstraZeneca has said there is no evidence of a link between the vaccine and increased risk of clotting, while Northern Ireland's Department of Health has said it would continue to use the vaccine after receiving guidance from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nThe latest figures show that across Northern Ireland 629,461 people have now received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 54,636 have received two.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health recorded a further 121 cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nOne additional death was reported, bringing the department's total number of deaths with Covid-19 to 2,099.\nFor a second day in a row, no additional deaths were reported in the Republic of Ireland, where there have a total of 4,534 Covid-19-related deaths.\nThe Republic of Ireland's health department said there were 575 more confirmed cases, which brings that total to 227,316.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister said vaccination was a \"bridge to better, safer and more normal times for everyone\".\nChief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the more people are vaccinated then \"the more we are all protected\".\nHe received his first jab on Monday morning.\n\"Vaccination alone will not provide 100% protection but it will change the balance in our favour against this virus. \n\"When your turn comes, don't delay, get the jab. Protect yourself and others,\" he said.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster also urged those eligible to take up the offer of a vaccine.\n\"The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) have been very clear that it is safe to take the AstraZeneca vaccine,\" said the DUP leader.\n\"I am looking forward to taking it, either this week or next week, depending on when I am able to get my vaccine booked for, but it is very important that people continue to take the vaccine.\"\nOn Monday, Dr Alan Stout, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) NI GP committee, said it was the large supply of AstraZeneca jab that allowed the vaccination programme to continue at the speed it is. \nHe advised people that it was safe to receive, and there was also a risk of blood clotting with things like long-haul air travel, the contraception pill, and some forms of surgery. \n\"These are world experts that we have in these regulators bodies and they are all saying the same thing, and they are all saying it is safe,\" he said. \nDr Stout said he was \"hopeful\" jabs would be offered to the over-40s age group by Easter, mirroring the situation reportedly happening elsewhere in the UK. \nHow bizarre. \nWhile health officials in the Republic of Ireland are choosing to pause the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, in Northern Ireland they're accelerating the programme. So who should we trust?\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) the vaccine is safe. That message has been reinforced by the British Medical Association.\nIt's hard to ignore that the MHRA has said that it has received a small number of reports of blood clots relating to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nBut it does seem that health officials in the Republic are being excessively cautious - Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and the country's deputy chief medical officer have said as much themselves. \nRelations between the EU and AstraZeneca are somewhat toxic at present with the Republic of Ireland, where the vaccine is reportedly in short supply, having been let down so many times on delivery of the vaccine. \nWhile people in the Republic will be rolling down their sleeves, in Northern Ireland an even greater number are preparing to roll them up.\nThe rollout will continue to be prioritised based on age, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance aimed at protecting the most vulnerable, the Department of Health has said.\nVaccines are being dispensed in parallel by GP practices and vaccination centres. \nNorthern Ireland has seven regional vaccination centres: Royal Victoria Hospital, Ulster Hospital, South Lake Leisure Centre, Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Foyle Arena,  Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre.\nPlans are also being finalised for community pharmacies to join the programme in the coming weeks, the department added. \nAn additional regional mass vaccination centre will open at the end of March at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\nThe vaccination centres are now offering bookings to: \nCarers who have not already booked a vaccination appointment can email their health trust carer co-ordinators and they will make the necessary arrangements.\nGPs are providing vaccines to: \nThe latter clinically vulnerable (CV) group is expected to largely mirror those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.  \nCEV and CV individuals aged 16 and 17 years of age cannot receive the vaccine being used in GP practices.\nThese individuals will receive a letter from their GP and are able to book a vaccination slot at one of the vaccination centres.\nPeople who want to book a vaccination centre appointment are asked to do so online if it all possible.\nIf online booking is not possible, then the telephone booking number is 0300 200 7813.\nThe booking line is open 08:00 GMT until 20:00 Monday to Friday."

But we can't afford to simply throw caution to the wind.\n\"The virus is still out there. We've seen that in the past week with a slight increase in cases, and of course the virus is more infectious now than when we came out of lockdown last year,\n\"So taking care, being cautious, being sensible really matters if we are to avoid letting the virus run ahead of the vaccine.\"\nOpposition parties will have the chance to question Ms Sturgeon following her statement, and have been pushing for more detail about her plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has challenged Ms Sturgeon to \"stop putting Scotland's future on hold\" and \"publish the full plan that we're all waiting for\".\nHe said: \"We expect a roadmap that tells everyone to get ready - because we're getting our normal lives back.\n\"The Scottish people expect to be treated as adults, and honestly told - here's what to expect. They know that dates aren't chiselled in stone, but they deserve more clarity.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, meanwhile, has said the government must focus on improving the test and trace system as well as the vaccine programme if the virus is to be contained at low levels.\nAnd he has called for better recovery plans for the post-pandemic period, saying: \"Even when lockdown ends, and the virus is almost eliminated, we will still have to pick up the pieces and rebuild the country we love.\n\"Because the last year has torn through the very fabric of our society. The effects of the pandemic have hit us all, but it has also exposed the deep inequalities in our communities.\""

      "text": "A public inquiry into the Welsh government's handling of Covid-19 needs to be held when the \"pandemic is behind us\", the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford said the outbreak did not have to be \"all over\" before an investigation was held.\nBut he said ministers needed to be \"confident that we are emerging from it unambiguously\".\nThe Conservatives said they would hold an inquiry as soon as possible if in power after May's Senedd election.\nPlaid Cymru said a Wales-specific inquiry \"must begin while memories are fresh\".\nOn the anniversary of the first reported death with coronavirus in Wales, Mr Drakeford has announced the creation of two new woodlands \"as permanent living memorials to all those who have died\".\nThe exact locations of the two sites will be announced in the coming weeks, with one in the north and one in the south.\nOn Monday, Public Health Wales reported a total of 5,454 Covid-19 deaths in Wales.\nBut the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show Covid was mentioned on 7,592 death certificates up to 26 February.\nThe ONS data gives a bigger picture and includes deaths where Covid is confirmed or suspected by doctors and covers deaths in all settings, including care homes, hospices and people's homes.\nAn assessment of the number of deaths from all causes compared with what we would normally expect to see shows there were 5,447 deaths more than the five-year average.\nWhen looking at death rates in local areas, Wales has four areas in the worst 20 across England and Wales - Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, and Neath Port Talbot.\nThe first minister said Covid-19 would \"leave a mark that will last for many years\".\nHe said that was because of the thousands of families who have lost somebody during the pandemic, but also because of the way it would \"change the way we think about our own futures, about the way we work, about the precautions we take when global events of this sort can have such a profound impact on us locally\".\nLast June, Welsh ministers agreed an independent inquiry should be held into their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \nBut the government said it should be part of a probe into the response to the crisis across the UK.\nMinisters did not commit to a timetable for an investigation despite opposition parties' calls at the time for the inquiry to report before May's Senedd election.\nAsked when an inquiry might be held, Mark Drakeford said: \"It needs to be at the point when we can be confident that the pandemic is behind us. \n\"I don't mean necessarily all over, but we are confident that we are emerging from it unambiguously.\n\"And then it needs to be an inquiry that is not simply Welsh because so much of what has happened to us in Wales has been linked to the wider UK picture. \n\"So, it needs to be at a time when we can draw all those threads together and then it will be absolutely right that we look back and learn the lessons of what has taken place,\" he added.\nThe Welsh Conservatives have said there should be inquiries \"at both a UK and a Wales level\", with the party committing to one in Wales after the election if they are in power.\nRaising the issue at First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Tory group leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"I want to see a public inquiry as soon as possible make progress and, rather than lose it in a wider UK public inquiry, have a Wales-specific public inquiry.\" \nIn reply, Mr Drakeford said he felt a Wales-only inquiry \"would not be able to grapple with a long list of issues that will be fundamental to being able to draw the lessons from what has happened\".\nHe said a UK-wide public inquiry \"will, absolutely properly, look at the decision making of the Welsh Government as well.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"No-one can say when this pandemic will be behind us, so Wales must not be kept waiting to learn the lessons of the last year. \n\"In those 12 months we saw a failure to ensure universal testing of care home residents, failure to provide adequate PPE for health and care staff, and a failure to utilise Welsh testing capacity when it was most needed.\""

      "text": "The UK is pledging to shift its focus towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia, after a year-long review of its foreign policy.\nThe government said it would boost alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, describing it as \"increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world\".\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would work with China on issues such as climate change.\nAnd he warned against adopting a \"Cold-War mentality\" with the country. \nThe review, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out later in the House of Commons, also paves the way for an increase in nuclear warheads. \nLabour says the strategy will leave the UK \"woefully unprepared\".\nThe publication of the review comes amid growing internal pressure on the government from Conservative circles to harden its line on China over issues such as its clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. \nMr Raab said there were \"positives\" to the UK's relationship with China, including over trade and investment. He added that it would also not be possible to \"shift the dial\" on climate change without co-operating with the country.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said there would also be \"difficult issues\" to manage, including over protecting UK industrial secrets and telecoms infrastructure. \nBut he warned: \"It wouldn't make sense, I don't think it would be feasible to go into some old, outdated Cold War mentality with China.\"\nPressed on whether the UK should toughen its stance on the country, as advocated by so-called China hawks, Mr Raab replied: \"China is here to stay.\"\nMr Raab also said more nuclear warheads could be required as part of the Integrated Review, as they represented the \"ultimate insurance policy\" against global threats.\nFor years Britain's place in the world was defined by its membership of the European Union and its relationship with the United States. \nIt was often seen as a bridge between the two. \nBut Brexit changed all that. So now the government is looking for Britain to play a new global role. \nThe big idea of the so-called Integrated Review of foreign policy is a new focus on the Indo-Pacific. \nThe government wants to boost Britain's trade, security and diplomacy in a region that is seeing fast economic growth. \nBut it also wants to build new partnerships as Britain recalibrates its relationship with the biggest player in Asia, namely China. \nThe question is what this new \"Indo-Pacific tilt\" will actually mean in practice and whether it will come at a cost of not focusing enough on repairing relations with the EU. \nThe long-awaited integrated review of foreign and defence policy will also set out plans for a White House-style situation room built in the Cabinet Office.\nIt will also include plans for a new counter-terrorism operations centre, intended to improve the speed of response to terrorist incidents.\nSir Alex Younger, a former head of MI6, told Today the gap between western nations and China had closed in important ways during the coronavirus pandemic, and a new approach was now needed.\nWhile he said there was \"no sense declaring a new Cold War\", Sir Alex admitted both China and the Russian government presented \"generational\" threats to Britain.\nWhile the government says Nato remains the bedrock of defence and security in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, it wants to work alongside allies to \"shape a more open international order in which democracies flourish\".\nBBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the aim of the review would be to showcase offensive as well as defensive capabilities, suggesting high-tech investment in fields like artificial intelligence will help modernise the military, maintain Britain's power and bring economic growth at home.\nBut he said becoming a technology \"superpower\" and competing with the likes of China was no easy task.\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there was a \"yawning chasm\" between the government's words and actions and said government policy had \"left our defences down in our own backyard\".\nThe publication of the review comes months after Boris Johnson announced a \u00a316.5bn increase in defence spending over the next four years.\nAt the time, he said the funding would allow for investment in an agency dedicated to artificial intelligence and a \"space command\" capable of launching the UK's first rocket by 2022, as well as a cyber corridor across the north of England which would include headquarters for the new National Cyber Force.\nBut MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee have warned the extra funding could be swallowed up by a \"black hole\" in department finances, with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facing a potential \u00a317bn shortfall in its current equipment programme.\nThe committee said a further \u00a320bn the military wanted to invest has not been included in the budget and the MPs also accused the MoD of making unrealistic claims about future efficiency savings.\nIts chair, Meg Hillier, said it was crucial that the extra money for defence was not eaten up by the \"constant debilitating\" budget overruns that \"have been eroding our national defence and security for years\".\nThe MoD said the increased funding would \"restore financial sustainability\"."

The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

Last month, it clinched a global deal with Google.\nMr Murdoch's media empire began with his Australian newspapers.\nThe deal covers all of News Corp Australia's content. It controls about 70% of newspaper circulation in Australia with titles including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun. \nIt also owns news.com.au, as well as the Fox News-modelled conservative TV network Sky News Australia, which has grown to become the most-shared Australian news brand on Facebook.\nNews Corp already has a different deal with Facebook for its US media titles, under which the platform pays for stories to include in its Facebook News tab.\nLike other publishers globally, Australian media outlets lost revenue in the past decade as advertisers turned to internet giants such as Facebook and Google.\nThe tech firms argue they simply enable people to find news content and help news publishers by driving traffic back to news sites from their platforms. But carrying news content also drives viewers - and advertising money - to the tech giants, news producers say. \nNews Corp spearheaded a lobbying campaign in Australia - with support from its traditional rivals - to get politicians to make the tech firms pay for news content from its sites.\nThe Australian government then drew up legislation to enshrine \"fairer\" contract negotiations between media and tech companies.\nThe News Media Bargaining Code encourages tech firms to strike their own commercial deals with media outlets, such as this one between Facebook and News Corp. Without such deals, the law would potentially force tech firms into forced arbitration with publishers over the value of content.\nBattles over the law's design led Facebook to suddenly block all access to Australian news content on its site last month.\nThe news ban lasted for about a week before the Australian government made concessions and passed the law on 25 February.\nOn Tuesday, News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson praised the Facebook deal as a \"landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism\".\n\"Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order,\" said Mr Thomson.\n\"This digital denouement has been more than a decade in the making.\"\nAnalysts looking at Australia's media law have long suggested that it is primarily designed to help big firms like News Corp as opposed to smaller media titles. \nAnother of Australia's top three media companies - Seven West - also signed a deal with Facebook last month.\nThe Facebook-News Corp deal came as a parliamentary inquiry in Canberra examined News Corp's media dominance and influence in domestic affairs.\nIt was sparked by an anti-Murdoch petition from former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd which received more than 500,000 signatures.\nThis deal was always going to be big. News Corps owns a huge chunk of the media market here in Australia. So it's not surprising that when Facebook finally agreed to start payment negotiations after parliament passed the News Media Bargaining Code, the Murdoch empire was going to get a substantial sum, even if they haven't shared the number. \nBut the fact that Facebook sat down and negotiated payment for news outlets is headline worthy - this is our first glimpse at what the application of this massively disputed law will look like. \nThe key for this code, however, is going to be how smaller media outlets and local newspapers fare with it. They are the ones which have suffered the most in loss of advertising revenue. \nAlso, what hasn't been put to the test yet is how Facebook will react to forced arbitration if it's unable to reach a deal with a given news company.  Remember, when the government was advocating for this legislation it said that one of its aims was to tilt that balance of power in the skewed dynamic between the tech giants and the media. \nThe idea isn't just that conglomerates like Rupert Murdoch's reach massive payment agreements. The big headline is when a small local news outlet is able to confidently negotiate with Facebook and get paid for news content they create for their communities. "

      "title": "Climate change: Jet fuel from waste 'dramatically lowers' emissions",
      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A new approach to making jet fuel from food waste has the potential to massively reduce carbon emissions from flying, scientists say.\nCurrently, most of the food scraps that are used for energy around the world are converted into methane gas.\nBut researchers in the US have found a way of turning this waste into a type of paraffin that works in jet engines.\nThe authors of the new study say the fuel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 165% compared to fossil energy.\nThis figure comes from the reduction in carbon emitted from airplanes plus the emissions that are avoided when food waste is diverted from landfill.\nThe aviation industry worldwide is facing some difficult decisions about how to combine increased demand for flying with the need to rapidly cut emissions from the sector.\nIn the US, airlines currently use around 21 billion gallons of jet fuel every year, with demand expected to double by the middle of the century. At the same time, they have committed to cutting CO2 by 50%.\nWith the development of battery-powered airplanes for long haul flights a distant prospect at this point, much attention has focussed on replacing existing jet fuel with a sustainable alternative. \nIn fact the UK government has just announced a \u00a315m competition to encourage companies to develop jet fuel from household waste products.\nCurrent methods of making green jet fuel are based on a similar approach to making biodiesel for cars and heavy goods vehicles.\nIt normally requires the use of virgin vegetable oils as well as waste fats, oil and grease to make the synthetic fuel.\nAt present, it is more economical to convert these oils and wastes into diesel as opposed to jet fuel - which requires an extra step in the process, driving up costs. \nNow, researchers say that they have developed an alternative method able to turn food waste, animal manure and waste water into a competitive jet hydrocarbon.\nMuch of this material, termed wet-waste, is at present is turned into methane gas. However, the authors found a way of interrupting this process so it produced volatile fatty acids (VFA) instead of CH4. \nThe researchers were then able to use a form of catalytic conversion to upgrade the VFA to two different forms of sustainable paraffin.\nWhen the two forms were combined they were able to blend 70% of the mixture with regular jet fuel, while still meeting the extremely strict quality criteria that Federal authorities impose on aircraft fuels.\n\"There's exciting jet fuels that rely on burning trash and dry waste but this actually works for those wastes that have high water content, which we normally dispose of in landfill,\" said Derek Vardon, a senior research engineer at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the lead author on the study.\n\"Being able to show that you can take these volatile fatty acids, and that there's a really elegant, simple way to turn it into jet fuel - that's where I see the broader applicability of this one, and folks can continue to develop and refine it.\"\nThe new fuel has a potentially significant impact on emissions as it not only limits the CO2 that comes from fossil sources used by the airlines, but it also gets rid of the methane that would bubble up from landfill if the waste food was just dumped. \nAnother major advantage is that this new fuel produces around 34% less soot than current standards. This is important because soot plays a key role in the formation of contrails from airplanes which adds a powerful warming effect to CO2 coming from the engines. \n\"That's where we see the most potential for this technology is that you're preventing methane emissions, and dramatically lowering the carbon footprint of jet fuel. And you just can't do that with fossil fuels without getting into things like offsets,\" said Derek Vardon.\nThe research team say they are planning to scale up the production of the new fuel and aim to have test flights with Southwest Airlines in 2023.\nMany environmental groups are sceptical about attempts to develop sustainable aviation fuels, believing that it amounts to green-washing. They argue that people should just fly less. \n\"Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet,\" Derek Vardon says. \n\"So we do want to definitely emphasise that reduction is the most important and most significant change you can make. But there's also pragmatism and need for aviation solutions now, so that's where we want to strike a balance as we need a basket of measures, to really start getting our carbon footprint down in a variety of sectors, including aviation.\"\nThe study has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "tags": "Bargoed,New Tredegar,Caerphilly,Care homes,Elderly care",
      "text": "Residents at a care home were \"dehumanised\" by staff and the standards of care were \"wholly inadequate\", an inquest has found.\nThe deaths of six residents at Brithdir Nursing Home from 2003-2005 in New Tredegar, Caerphilly, eventually triggered a police investigation.\nCoroner Geraint Williams said residents were \"warehoused\", meaning they are \"simply kept, fed and watered\".\nThe evidence suggested \"even the feeding and watering was inadequate\".\nStanley James, 89, June Hamer, 71, Stanley Bradford, 76, Edith Evans, 85, Evelyn Jones, 87, and William Hickman, 71 were all residents at the home.\nThe coroner said their families were \"deliberately\" kept in the dark about the existence of pressure sores, and families were \"deceived\" \n\"This was a gross betrayal of the trust relatives placed in Brithdir,\" he told the court.\nHowever, a lack of available evidence and multiple staff looking after residents meant he could not reach a conclusion of unlawful killing in any of the cases.\nDocumentation, including care plans and feeding charts were \"in some cases clearly fabricated\".\nThe coroner said the \"lowest point\" was how residents were \"dehumanised\", including when incontinence pads were changed in the home's lounge in front of other residents.\nThe manager Peter Smith's statement said he believed they would not have realised because they had dementia.\nGeraint Williams said the points outlined \"contributed significantly\" to the deaths of the six residents.\nAt the start of the inquest, which began in January, Mr Williams said: \"It is a matter of regret that so many years have passed, with the consequence that the families have been denied justice for so long.\"\nIn relation to the six residents, the coroner gave the following conclusions:\nStanley James developed \"multiple\" pressure sores during his time at Brithdir but the coroner said that expert Malcolm Hodkinson had told the inquest he could not say that Mr James died of the ulcers.\nThe coroner said he accepted the cause of death given for Mr James by a GP at the time. But he added: \"The lack of care did cause the pressure ulceration. He was not being turned in accordance with his care plan.\"\nReferring to a former nurse at the home, Daphne Richards, he said her failings in relation to Mr James were \"truly, exceptionally bad\".\nThe coroner said June Hamer had a \"painful and uncomfortable death\".\n\"Mrs Hamer received an incredibly poor standard of care in Brithdir. She was frequently left in wet clothes. Generally her personal hygiene was neglected by staff and pressure sores were allowed to develop,\" he told the court.\nGeraint Williams said he believed an infected pressure sore played a part in her death, adding: \"It is clear that Mrs Hamer needed prompt and appropriate medical care. I find the the failure was gross and directly contributed to her death.\"\nThe coroner said William Hickman had 17 areas of pressure damage to his skin while at Brithdir.\nWhen he was admitted to hospital, he had a pressure sore 3.5in by 2in (9cm by 5cm) in size and was in an \"awful physical condition\".\nConsidering the evidence, the coroner said he considered there to have been \"gross failings in the care provided which were a direct cause of his death. Further I find it was obvious that Mr Hickman needed basic care\".\nThe coroner said he found the evidence of Mr Bradford's daughters \"powerful and completely believable\" and he agreed Mr Bradford had been \"forgotten about\" by staff at the home.  \n\"In my opinion the evidence demonstrated overwhelmingly the standard of care was grossly deficient and was a significant contributory factor to his death,\" he said.\n\"It was abundantly clear that Mr Bradford needed care and this should have been obvious to the most inexperienced of staff.\"\nHis daughters Pam Cook and Gaynor Evans were appalled by what happened and believed action should have been taken against Dr Prana Das sooner.\n\"We can't believe how it was left to just go on and on,\" Mrs Evans said. \n\"They knew what was happening and the risks to residents, and he was still allowed to have his homes open. They should have been shut down.\n\"It makes me think now how many other residents, before this all came out, how many others suffered and died from neglect?\"\nMrs Evans said \"someone\" should have been jailed \"especially Dr Das\". \n\"He got away with it all,\" she said.\nMrs Cook said: \"We've shed a lot of tears and had a lot of upset but besides that it has made us very, very angry.\n\"This was left to go on and no-one stopped it and everyone blames each other.\" \nMr Williams said there were \"gross failings at every level\" in the \"haphazard and slapdash\" care of Edith Evans which contributed to her death.\nMrs Evans's family had raised concerns about the cleanliness of a feeding tube into her stomach, known as a PEG.\nWhen taken to hospital, staff were shocked at the level of care. Her appearance was described as \"unclean, with dirty and matted hair, incontinent and dirty with faeces\". Her feeding tube was infected with the superbug MRSA.\nStaff at the home said they were not aware of a problem with the PEG, which Mr Williams found \"inconceivable\"\nSenior nurse and manager Phil McCaffrey had denied any knowledge of the poor state of Mrs Evans's PEG, which the coroner called \"simply untrue\" adding he had showed \"gross failures that contributed to Mrs Evans's death\".\nMrs Evans, did not have any children, but was survived by nieces Gail Morris, Gaynor Williams and Betty Williams.\n\"We were horrified,\" Gaynor Williams said.\n\"There's more come out and we thought we knew everything, we knew so little.\"\nMrs Morris said: \"I think we have been angry since October 2005 when Edie went into hospital and that's when we found out how bad things were.\"\nThey said they had learnt their aunt contracted MRSA twice.\nLike other families, they only found out Dr Das ran Brithdir after the death of Mrs Evans.\n\"When they said Aunt Edie was going into Brithdir and we said 'didn't Dr Das own it?' and they said 'no, he's not there now',\" Gaynor Williams said.\nMrs Morris said: \"It would be nice to say it won't happen again, but I think it could easily happen again.\"\nThe coroner said that the details he heard in relation to Evelyn Jones amounted to \"institutional abuse\".\nA 50cm (20in) pressure sore on Mrs Jones's back was described by doctors as \"the worst they had seen\".\n\"It is clear that failure was a direct cause of Mrs Jones's death - the totality is overwhelming - and there was a flagrant disregard for her obvious need for medical attention,\" said Mr Williams.\nThe coroner also assessed evidence from the owners and managers at the home, as well as the state agencies.\nHe found Dr Das, the owner of Puretruce Health Care Ltd which owned 22 homes including Brithdir, was \"aggressive to all who opposed him\" and his \"sole concern was making money from his businesses\".\nThe coroner said Paul Black, the chief executive of the company, was an \"unreliable and dishonest witness\" who played an active and direct part in deceiving the state agencies\".\nThe state agencies, including Caerphilly Local Health Board, Caerphilly council and Care Inspectorate Wales, were often \"too focused on systems and processes\".\nGiving his formal conclusions, the coroner said given the fact that many staff were involved in the care of residents, and that some evidence was not available, it was \"not safe to reach a conclusion of unlawful killing\" for any of the residents.  \nFor Stanley James he gave conclusion of natural causes.\nFor June Hamer, William Hickman, Stanley Bradford, Edith Evans and Evelyn Jones he recorded narrative conclusions and said all five deaths \"were contributed to by neglect\".\nThe coroner ended by thanking the families of the six residents.\nHe said: \"I wish to pay tribute to the families for the honourable and dignified way that they had conducted themselves.\n\"It is a considerable regret that it has taken so long and I hope the families now feel that justice has been done for their loved ones.\"\nFollowing Operation Jasmine, a policy inquiry into deaths at six care homes in south Wales, Dr Prana Das was due to stand trial on neglect and fraud charges, but the trial was called off after he suffered brain damage when he was attacked in his home by two intruders in 2012.\nHe died in January 2020.\nAn inquest into the death of a seventh resident, Matthew Higgins, 86, will be held now this hearing has concluded.\nThe author of a review into the alleged abuse at nursing homes in south east Wales said people must \"never be complacent\" about levels of care.\nBut Dr Margaret Flynn said she did not believe there was anything of the same scale at present in Wales as that seen at Brithdir.\nShe said there had been significant changes, but there still needed to be more scrutiny of private companies running care homes.\n\"Changes did result from this dreadful time in health and social care, in regulation and in policing, because these poor people's injuries and their experiences were made visible and what was once tolerated is no longer tolerated,\" she said.\n\"We have reason to be hopeful but we may never, ever be complacent. Care homes can change with every shift and it's important we remain attentive to that.\n\"I share the disappointment of the families that it is very unlikely there will ever be prosecutions.\""

But we can't afford to simply throw caution to the wind.\n\"The virus is still out there. We've seen that in the past week with a slight increase in cases, and of course the virus is more infectious now than when we came out of lockdown last year,\n\"So taking care, being cautious, being sensible really matters if we are to avoid letting the virus run ahead of the vaccine.\"\nOpposition parties will have the chance to question Ms Sturgeon following her statement, and have been pushing for more detail about her plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has challenged Ms Sturgeon to \"stop putting Scotland's future on hold\" and \"publish the full plan that we're all waiting for\".\nHe said: \"We expect a roadmap that tells everyone to get ready - because we're getting our normal lives back.\n\"The Scottish people expect to be treated as adults, and honestly told - here's what to expect. They know that dates aren't chiselled in stone, but they deserve more clarity.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, meanwhile, has said the government must focus on improving the test and trace system as well as the vaccine programme if the virus is to be contained at low levels.\nAnd he has called for better recovery plans for the post-pandemic period, saying: \"Even when lockdown ends, and the virus is almost eliminated, we will still have to pick up the pieces and rebuild the country we love.\n\"Because the last year has torn through the very fabric of our society. The effects of the pandemic have hit us all, but it has also exposed the deep inequalities in our communities.\""

      "text": "Prolific burglars, robbers and thieves are to be tagged with GPS trackers in a bid to stop them reoffending.\nOffenders will be automatically tagged for up to 12 months after being released from prison, under a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pilot.\nGwent, Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Humberside and West Midlands police forces are all taking part.\nThe MoJ said tracking offenders 24 hours a day would act as a deterrent.\nIt estimated 250 offenders, who have served a year in prison, will be fitted with the tag in the first six months of the scheme, as part of their licence conditions.\nPolice will be able to cross-reference the GPS data with reports of new thefts, robberies and burglaries to see if offenders were in the area at the time.\nBurglars broke into Diane Titmus's hair salon, stealing about \u00a32,000 of stock and all of her stylists' hairdryers and straighteners, in December last year.\nThe break-in was the 12th time the Newport salon had been broken into in 30 years.\n\"They just took the most expensive items, they knew what they were doing,\" said Ms Titmus.\n\"The first time it happened was some years ago. I came in on the Christmas weekend, our biggest weekend, they had taken every single item. \n\"I had to run around to all my friends and borrow dryers, scissors, just to be able to work that day.\n\"I was really very, very upset, but also angry. How dare they? I worked really hard all my life to have this, just for someone to come in and take it.\"\nMs Titmus said it had happened so many times she no longer made claims on her insurance because of the increase it would mean to her premium. \n\"Other times they've cost me \u00a3500 when they break a window and they probably had about 30p in pennies that were left in the drawer,\" she said.\n\"We just have to write it off as a loss. We work hard for a week to pay the burglar - that's how it works out.\" \nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the number of theft and burglary offences in England and Wales fell as many people stayed at home.\nMinister for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said, with levels expect to return to those seen before Covid-19, the tagging pilot was \"critical\".\n\"We want to make sure we help those offenders get back on the straight and narrow,\" he said.\n\"We think 24-hour-a-day supervision, through this tag on their ankle, will help them to realise that they're effectively being watched, and therefore choose something else to do, other than go back to their former crime.\n\"It's a rigorous supervision in a way that we haven't really seen before and we think it will have a big impact.\" \nMore than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released from prison, according to MoJ figures.\nIt said these types of crimes cost the public an estimated \u00a34.8bn a year, yet 79% of theft cases and 62% of robbery cases resulted in no suspect being identified - compared with an average of 24% in all other cases. \nFollowing the pilots, the MoJ said it planned to roll out the scheme, run by the National Probation Service, to a further 13 forces in September. \nTags have already been introduced in parts of England and Wales to monitor whether offenders who who were convicted of committing crimes while fuelled with alcohol, have been drinking.\nThe \"sobriety tags\" monitor sweat levels of the wearer every 30 minutes to see whether they have drunk alcohol. The probation service is then alerted if they have had a drink. \nGwent's Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said a small number of offenders were committing thefts, burglaries and robberies.\n\"Offenders tend to be serial offenders doing quite a lot of these types of crime over a short period of time, that can be very forensically aware, they can locate premises that aren't overlooked so there aren't any witnesses and then it becomes very difficult to pull those clues together to solve that particular crime. \n\"Obviously with the ability to be able to tag our persistent offenders it means we're able to see where they are and if they're in proximity of offences that have occurred,\" she said."

He added that it would also not be possible to \"shift the dial\" on climate change without co-operating with the country.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said there would also be \"difficult issues\" to manage, including over protecting UK industrial secrets and telecoms infrastructure. \nBut he warned: \"It wouldn't make sense, I don't think it would be feasible to go into some old, outdated Cold War mentality with China.\"\nPressed on whether the UK should toughen its stance on the country, as advocated by so-called China hawks, Mr Raab replied: \"China is here to stay.\"\nMr Raab also said more nuclear warheads could be required as part of the Integrated Review, as they represented the \"ultimate insurance policy\" against global threats.\nFor years Britain's place in the world was defined by its membership of the European Union and its relationship with the United States. \nIt was often seen as a bridge between the two. \nBut Brexit changed all that. So now the government is looking for Britain to play a new global role. \nThe big idea of the so-called Integrated Review of foreign policy is a new focus on the Indo-Pacific. \nThe government wants to boost Britain's trade, security and diplomacy in a region that is seeing fast economic growth. \nBut it also wants to build new partnerships as Britain recalibrates its relationship with the biggest player in Asia, namely China. \nThe question is what this new \"Indo-Pacific tilt\" will actually mean in practice and whether it will come at a cost of not focusing enough on repairing relations with the EU. \nThe long-awaited integrated review of foreign and defence policy will also set out plans for a White House-style situation room built in the Cabinet Office.\nIt will also include plans for a new counter-terrorism operations centre, intended to improve the speed of response to terrorist incidents.\nSir Alex Younger, a former head of MI6, told Today the gap between western nations and China had closed in important ways during the coronavirus pandemic, and a new approach was now needed.\nWhile he said there was \"no sense declaring a new Cold War\", Sir Alex admitted both China and the Russian government presented \"generational\" threats to Britain.\nWhile the government says Nato remains the bedrock of defence and security in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, it wants to work alongside allies to \"shape a more open international order in which democracies flourish\".\nBBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the aim of the review would be to showcase offensive as well as defensive capabilities, suggesting high-tech investment in fields like artificial intelligence will help modernise the military, maintain Britain's power and bring economic growth at home.\nBut he said becoming a technology \"superpower\" and competing with the likes of China was no easy task.\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there was a \"yawning chasm\" between the government's words and actions and said government policy had \"left our defences down in our own backyard\".\nThe publication of the review comes months after Boris Johnson announced a \u00a316.5bn increase in defence spending over the next four years.\nAt the time, he said the funding would allow for investment in an agency dedicated to artificial intelligence and a \"space command\" capable of launching the UK's first rocket by 2022, as well as a cyber corridor across the north of England which would include headquarters for the new National Cyber Force.\nBut MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee have warned the extra funding could be swallowed up by a \"black hole\" in department finances, with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facing a potential \u00a317bn shortfall in its current equipment programme.\nThe committee said a further \u00a320bn the military wanted to invest has not been included in the budget and the MPs also accused the MoD of making unrealistic claims about future efficiency savings.\nIts chair, Meg Hillier, said it was crucial that the extra money for defence was not eaten up by the \"constant debilitating\" budget overruns that \"have been eroding our national defence and security for years\".\nThe MoD said the increased funding would \"restore financial sustainability\"."

      "text": "It's a longstanding mystery: how Mars lost the water that flowed across its surface billions of years ago.\nScientists now think they have an answer: much of it became trapped in the planet's outer layer - its crust.\nThe ancient water exists in the form of minerals contained within Martian rocks.\nThe findings have been discussed at the 52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference and are published in Science journal.\nThe study used measurements gathered from Mars-orbiting spacecraft, rovers and meteorites.\nResearchers then developed a computer simulation of how water was lost from the planet over time.\nMore than four billion years ago, Mars was warmer and wetter - possibly with a thicker atmosphere. Water coursed through rivers, cutting channels in the rock, and pooled in impact craters.\nThe Red Planet could have held enough water to cover its entire surface in a layer measuring between 100m and one kilometre deep.\nAround a billion years later, Mars had made the transition to the colder, desolate planet we recognise today.\n\"We have known for a long time that Mars was much wetter in its early history. But, the exact fate of that water has been an ongoing problem,\" said planetary scientist Dr Peter Grindrod, who was not involved with the latest study.\nDr Grindrod, from London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News: \"We already know from studies of the atmosphere of Mars that some of that water was lost to space, and ice deposits on and just below the surface tell us that some water became frozen.\"\nEarth has a magnetic shield, or magnetosphere, that helps prevent the atmosphere from escaping. But Mars' magnetic shield is weak and could have allowed elemental components of water to escape from the planet.\nBut the rate at which hydrogen - one chemical constituent of water - escapes from that atmosphere today suggests this can't be the whole story.\nIf it's assumed that the current loss rate for hydrogen was the same in the past, \"it's a pretty small amount of water that you would have lost through this escape process\", said co-author Eva Linghan Scheller, from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. \nIn other words, most of the water must have gone elsewhere.\nThe results of the team's computer modelling work show that between 30% and 99% of Mars' initial water was incorporated into minerals and buried in the planet's crust.\nCo-author Prof Bethany Ehlmann, also from from Caltech, explained that, \"by studying data from Mars missions, It became clear that it was common - and not rare - to find evidence of water alteration\". \nShe continued: \"When the crust becomes altered, it takes water - like liquid water - and sequesters it in a hydrated mineral that has water in its structure so that it is effectively trapped.\"\nThe authors suggest that most of the water was lost between about 4.1 and 3.7 billion years ago - during a stretch of Martian history known as the Noachian Period. \nDr Michael Meyer, lead scientist for Nasa's Mars exploration program, said: \"The original overarching role of Mars exploration has been to follow the water, since it plays such a central role in the geology, climate and life of the planet.\n\"This is a very important paper to understand how much water was on Mars, how it might have been lost and where it might be today.\"\nDr Grindrod added: \"What this new study tells us is that a lot of that water, possibly the majority, could have actually been locked into the rocks on Mars. This process of hydration is capable of storing large volumes of water, up to an amount equivalent to a global layer a kilometre deep.\"\n\"Although most of the liquid water had probably disappeared after about one and a half billion years after Mars formed, we see evidence of hydrated minerals at the surface today, in areas like Jezero Crater, which is currently being explored by the Perseverance rover. \n\"The early climate of Mars remains one of the most important topics in planetary science, and this study will help our understanding of the processes responsible for water loss.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted.\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\nThat date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that \"brighter days are ahead of us\".\nThe \"stay at home\" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to \"stay local\" for a further three weeks.\nOther changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April.\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that:\nA decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept \"under ongoing review\".\nShe told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest.\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\".\nHowever, she said she was \"optimistic\" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues.\n\"This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,\" she said.\nRestrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or \"as soon as possible thereafter\".\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus.\nShe said that \"our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that\" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place \"for some time to come\".\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome.\nHowever, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments.\nAnd she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can \"get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear\".\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed \"effective testing and tracing\" systems to keep infections low.\nHe called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that \"transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close\".\nData not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland.\nThe first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored.\nWhen Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic.\nToday, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme.\nBut the first minister said this was the \"most hopeful\" she had felt for a long time and that \"something much closer to actual normality\" might be achieved as we move into summer.\nThe change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown.\nMs Sturgeon said the government had to make \"careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions\" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving \"steadily and in one direction\".\nThe final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the \"need for medium term-support\". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year.\nScottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was \"most welcome for everyone\", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission\", and that \"we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can\".\nScottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the \"indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area\".\nThe first minister said everything was \"predicated on the data going in the right direction\", and that \"all bets are off\" if case numbers rise sharply again.\nShe told MSPs that her \"hope and ambition\" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month."

      "text": "The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has warned the US not to \"cause a stink\", as President Joe Biden prepares to set out his Korean policy.\nIn remarks on state media, Kim Yo-jong criticised the US and South Korea for conducting joint military exercises. \nHer comments come a day before top US officials are due to arrive in Seoul. \nThe US government has said it has been trying for weeks to make diplomatic contact with North Korea.\nPyongyang has yet to acknowledge that President Biden is now in office.\nThe two countries remain at loggerheads over the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\nKim Yo-jong was quoted in the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper as saying: \"A word of advice to the new administration of the United States that is struggling to spread the smell of gunpowder on our land from across the ocean.\n\"If it wants to sleep in peace for [the] coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.\"\nShe reiterated her country's opposition to the joint military exercises - which North Korea describes as preparations for invasion - saying: \"The South Korean government yet again chose the 'March of War', the 'March of Crisis'.\"\nKim Yo-jong is the younger sister of Kim Jong-un and the only one of his siblings considered a close and powerful ally.\nMany of us in Seoul have been expecting this. North Korea usually reacts when South Korea and the US carry out joint military exercises. Sometimes that is in the form of a missile test. On other occasions, such as this one, it responds to the so-called \"war games\" with a string of angry words.\nKim Yo-jong has been her brother's favoured attack dog for a while and this statement is no exception. She aims at  two targets in her remarks: the joint drills and the visit to Seoul by US secretary of state and the defence chief.\nIt at least lets Washington and Seoul know Pyongyang is watching and listening, despite not responding to the recent back-channel attempts by the White House.\nKim Yo-jong didn't elaborate on exactly what North Korea would do if it didn't like what it heard during these meetings. But she is saying - you have been warned.\nNorth Korea's nuclear ambitions are expected to be high on the agenda during this week's visits to South Korea and Japan by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin.\nMr Biden has already announced a policy review on North Korea, which is expected to be unveiled next month.\nDuring the election campaign he called Mr Kim \"a thug\" and said North Korean nuclear disarmament had to happen before US and UN economic sanctions could be relaxed.\nRelations between the US and North Korea plummeted in 2017, when the North tested long-range missiles capable of hitting American cities.\nTensions eased as President Donald Trump sought to develop a personal rapport with Mr Kim.\nBut much-trumpeted meetings - including summits in Singapore and Vietnam - failed to break the impasse over nuclear disarmament and sanctions.

      "text": "Northern Ireland Executive ministers have agreed to lift more Covid-19 public health restrictions this week, allowing theatre and concert venues to reopen.\nThe rules on live music and the number of people who are allowed to meet in a private home are also being eased.\nMinisters have been gradually lifting restrictions in the past few months, following the strict lockdown they imposed across Northern Ireland after Christmas 2020.\nHowever, a recent surge in infection rates and the resulting pressure on hospital admissions mean some restriction remain in place for now. \nBBC News NI explains the latest rules on socialising, travel, face coverings and other areas.\nYes. On Monday, ministers agreed that a total of 10 people from three households would now be allowed to meet inside a home.\nChildren under 12 do not count towards the total.\nPreviously, the limit was six people from two households (or 10 people if one household was bigger than six people).\nOvernight stays have been allowed for some time.\nYes, and the numbers allowed to enter have been gradually increasing. \nFrom Monday 26 July, a maximum of 15 people from an unlimited number of households are able to meet in a private garden.\nAgain, children aged 12 and under do not count towards this limit. \nYes, you can.\nA traffic light system for international travel came into force on 24 May, with a limited number of countries on the green list meaning people arriving in Northern Ireland from those areas were exempt from quarantine.\nWith the expanded vaccination rollout, more significant changes took effect on 19 July.\nNew rules came into force on that date which meant travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from amber countries (except France) were able to avoid quarantine if they had received both their Covid-19 vaccines in the UK. \nThese passengers still need to produce evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before departure and take a PCR test on day two after arrival.\nThere are exemptions for some including children under 18, those medically advised against vaccination and clinical trial participants.\nOn Thursday 29 July, the NI Executive announced that people who have been fully vaccinated in the EU (except France) or the US will not need to isolate when coming to Northern Ireland. \nThe move, from Monday 2 August, brings Northern Ireland in line with England, Scotland and Wales.\nThere are also no limits on travel to other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).\nOn 24 May, the Northern Ireland Executive lifted its guidance on self-isolating after travelling to another part of the CTA.\nTesting is still advised after arriving back in Northern Ireland from another part of the CTA but it is guidance only.\nYes, live music resumed from 5 July with a number of restrictions, but these rules are in the process of being eased.\nStormont ministers have now agreed that concert venues and theatres can reopen from 18:00 BST on Tuesday 27 July.\nBut the venues must sell tickets in advance of performance, they must have allocated seating and ensure social distancing of at least 1m (3ft).\nVolume restrictions on live indoor music which were in force from 5- 26 July have now been lifted.  \nHowever, dancing is not permitted and this restriction is not due to be reconsidered by ministers before 12 August.\nNightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed at present. \nAlthough Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the legal requirement to use face coverings in England from 19 July, that change did not apply in Northern Ireland.\nMasks have been mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland since July 2020 and in shops since August 2020, with a limited number of exemptions.\nBut from 26 July, people attending indoor religious services in Northern Ireland will no longer have to wear a face covering during the service.\nHowever, it is still be a legal requirement to wear face masks when entering and exiting the building, and guidance will recommend that worshipers keep their masks on during services. \nFace coverings remain compulsory in other settings, including:\nIt's a more complicated picture.\nThe executive says from 26 July, where it's still the law to socially distance - such as restaurants and workplaces - the limit will be reduced to 1m for indoors activities.\nThe 1m rule was then extended to include retail and shopping centres.\nIt will be removed for all outdoor activities from law but guidance will be that social distancing is recommended at 1m (3ft) where possible.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan recently said more significant changes were coming and that he hoped the executive could agree on 12 August to put in place a date to end social distancing in law.\nThat meeting could also see ministers discuss lifting the remaining restrictions on hospitality, such as the numbers of people allowed to sit at a table together.\nThese ceremonies have been continuing with restrictions through the latest lockdown, but from 24 May, post-wedding and civil partnership receptions were allowed to resume.\nHowever, mitigations remain in place including:\nFrom 26 July, normal services resumed at MoT centres.\nDuring MoT examinations, a vehicle can be shared by the driver and the examiner for five minutes if both wear a mask. \nCustomers will be permitted to be seated safely for eight minutes and must remaining socially-distanced and wear a mask.\nThe executive said that was to allow customers to be present in testing halls and take their vehicle through the process with examiners.\nOn the same date - 26 July - other close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons do not need clients to book ahead for appointments first and overlapping appointments will also be allowed.\nQuite possibly, but do not expect Northern Ireland's rules to directly match the timeline in other parts of the UK.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive can change the restrictions regularly in line with new public health advice and said it is conscious of the pace of change in other jurisdictions.\nIt has said its decisions have been taken in a \"local context\".\nThe executive's planned meeting on 12 August will look at the requirements for face coverings and self-isolation as well as its guidance around working from home and relaxing restrictions on meeting at home.\nThat day could see ministers agree a date to end some of the measures that have dominated lives and livelihoods since last March.\nBut as ever, putting that in place requires support from the executive's five parties.\nAchieving political consensus on how and when to end restrictions remains challenging to navigate."

People are either more self-consciously aware or a loved one has noticed,\" he said. \nIn 2020, 114 people from Wales contacted the helpline about their own or someone else's behaviour, with 2,750 viewing the self-help website.\nMr Findlater added: \"Due to the pandemic, feelings of isolation, stress and general uncertainty, over the last year in particular, are often what leads to our callers' escalating pornography habits, and in turn, illegal online behaviour. \n\"It can be really tricky to spot the signs but they can include, becoming much more secretive with online devices, using them at odd times - such as early in the morning and feeling guilty or uneasy the next day.\"\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey said: \"Anyone who is having inappropriate thoughts about children, or anyone who believes a family member may be, should seek help from Stop It Now!, otherwise they should expect a visit from police officers.\""

      "text": "Celebrations are being planned to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee next year.\nIn February, the Queen will become the first British monarch to reach 70 years on the throne, with commemoration events planned over a four-day Bank Holiday weekend in June.\nQueen Elizabeth II has been the UK's head of state since 1952 when her father King George VI died. She is also the head of state for 15 other Commonwealth countries.\nThe 95-year-old monarch has four children, eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren with her late husband, Prince Philip, who died in April.\nOther members of the Royal Family include:\nIn a monarchy, a king or queen (the monarch) is the head of state. In the UK, we have something called a constitutional monarchy - the Queen is head of state, but does not get involved in politics, and laws are made by the Houses of Parliament.\nThe order of succession is the line in which members of the Royal Family stand to take over as the monarch when the existing one dies or abdicates (steps down from the throne).\nFirst in the line - the heir to the throne - is the monarch's first-born child.\nRoyal succession is governed by rules dating back hundreds of years. These were amended in 2013 so that royal sons no longer take precedence over their older sisters in the order.\nPrince Charles is first in line to the throne. His eldest son, Prince William, is second in line, and William's eldest child, Prince George, is third.\nIf a monarch dies, the heir to the throne becomes king or queen immediately.\nThe coronation, a glittering ceremony at which the monarch is formally crowned, takes place later, following careful planning and after a period of mourning for the previous king or queen.\nThe main elements of the occasion have remained largely unchanged for a millennium.\nThe coronation is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The monarch is anointed with holy oil, receives the orb and sceptre - which are symbols of royalty - and is crowned with the St Edward's Crown, the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels.\nAlthough the United Kingdom is a monarchy, the Queen's power is strictly symbolic and ceremonial, and she is expected to remain politically neutral. \nAmong the powers she has are:\nThe Queen and other senior royals carry out official engagements. \nFamily members also represent her in visits to other countries.\nMany are patrons for charities, and some have established their own - such as the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme for young people, founded by Prince Philip.\nThey have close ties to the armed forces. Prince William served in the Royal Air Force and Prince Harry served in the Army. \nEvery year, the UK government gives the Queen a single payment called the Sovereign Grant. \nThis is based on 25% of the Crown Estate's revenue from two years previously. The Crown Estate is an independent commercial property business. It includes the 4,800-acre Windsor Great Park and the Ascot racecourse in Berkshire, but is mostly made up of residential and commercial property.\nThe Sovereign Grant, which is \u00a385.9m for 2020-21, supports official royal duties and maintains occupied royal palaces.  \nPrince Charles receives an income from the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast portfolio of property and financial investments, which brought in \u00a320.4m last year.\nSomeone who marries a royal becomes a member of the Royal Family, and they are given a title when they marry. \nFor example, Lady Diana Spencer became Princess of Wales when she married Prince Charles in 1981.\nHowever, to become the monarch, you must have been born into the Royal Family. \nThe Queen's official London home is Buckingham Palace. \nShe usually spends weekends and a month over Easter at Windsor Castle in Berkshire. However, she has lived there throughout the pandemic.\nPrince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall live in Clarence House - less than half a mile from Buckingham Palace - when they are in London. \nPrince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, also live nearby - in Kensington Palace. Prince Harry and Meghan live in California."

      "text": "The UK is set to reverse plans to reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by the middle of the decade, as part of a foreign policy overhaul. \nThe overall cap on the number of warheads will now increase to 260, having been due to drop to 180 under previous plans from 2010.\nThe UK will shift focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, described as the world's \"growth engine\".\nAnd it pledges the UK will do more on the \"systemic challenge\" of China.\nOutlining the strategy to MPs, Boris Johnson said the UK would have to \"relearn the art\" of competing against countries with \"opposing values\".\nBut he added the UK would remain \"unswervingly committed\" to the Nato defence alliance and preserving peace and security in Europe.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an \"era of retreat,\" with armed forces cuts \"every year for the last decade\".\nThe integrated review of foreign and defence policies, which runs to over 100 pages, has taken over a year and sets out UK priorities until 2030.\nThe UK nuclear stockpile is estimated to comprise 195 warheads, and had been due to fall to 180 by the mid-2020s under a 2010 defence review.\nBut the latest assessment says this ambition is \"no longer possible\" given the \"evolving security environment\" over the last decade. \nIt adds that the UK will no longer publish figures on the size of its operational stockpile, to maintain \"deliberate ambiguity\" for adversaries. \nHowever, it pledges the UK will maintain the \"minimum destructive power needed to guarantee that the UK's nuclear deterrent remains credible\".\nThe review, which identifies Russia as the \"most acute threat\" to UK security, also says:\nThe review also pledged to reverse cuts on foreign aid, from 0.7% of national income down to 0.5%, when \"the fiscal situation allows\".\nThe government has previously faced criticism for the cuts, which it said were necessary in the wake of financial challenges posed by the Covid pandemic.\nThe review argues the UK should refocus its foreign policy towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia in the \"Indo-Pacific\" region.\nIt said the region's shipping lanes were vital to maintain UK trade with Asia, whilst the region is also on the \"frontline of new security challenges\".\nAnalysis by Rob Watson, BBC World Service UK Political Correspondent\nWhat's striking about the review is the continuity in UK foreign policy.  \nSo just as before Brexit and \"Global Britain\", the UK continues to see the main threats to its security as China, Russia, terrorism and cyber attacks.  And it continues to have as its main goals, among other things, the promotion of democracy, free trade, human rights and the fight against climate change. \nThere are differences, though. The most striking is the suggestion of a pivot away from Europe to the Indo-Pacific.\nBut exactly what that means is not spelled out (although we do know Boris Johnson will travel to India next month, and there will be new focus on new partnerships and trade agreements with south-east Asian countries).\nMore broadly, Mr Johnson's central claim is that leaving the EU will make the UK more nimble and flexible, whether it's in how to deal with China or becoming a science superpower or anything else.  \nCritics will say the review is long on aspiration and that the UK will face the same global challenges it faced before Brexit - but with one fewer foreign policy tool in its toolbox, namely its membership of the EU.  \nMr Johnson said: \"The review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values.\"\nHe said the UK had led international condemnation of China's \"mass detention\" of Uighur people in Xinjiang, and its actions in Hong Kong, adding: \"There is no question China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours.\"\nIn response, Sir Keir said UK policy towards China had been \"inconsistent\" and the government had \"turned a blind eye\" to the country's human rights abuses.\nHe said Labour remained committed to retaining nuclear weapons, but said the document had failed to detail the \"strategic purpose\" for increasing the warhead stockpile.\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the review demonstrated \"just how hollow the brand of Global Britain is\".\nHe also asked the prime minister \"who gave his government the democratic right to renege on the UK's obligations under the nuclear proliferation treaty\" referring to the government's plans on nuclear weapons.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Beatrice Fihn - head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons -  described the UK's decision to change its nuclear provision as \"outrageous, irresponsible and very dangerous\".\nShe said it went against international law and didn't address the real security threats faced by Britain such as climate change and disinformation. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent \nThe review calls China the \"biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security\".\nBut there is clearly disquiet among the government's own MPs that it hasn't been robust enough in identifying the challenge posed by its Communist regime.  \nFormer Conservative foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was worried by its description of China as a \"systemic\" challenge, given its current clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. \nAnother senior Conservative, Julian Lewis, took issue with its description of China as a \"partner\".\nHe added it suggested the \"grasping naivety\" of the party's approach under David Cameron and George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, \"still lingers on\".\nBoris Johnson said there was a \"balance to be struck\", and although the UK wanted a \"strong trading relationship,\" it should be \"clear-eyed\" and \"tough where we see risk\".\nBut the trade-offs between seeking investment and protecting the UK from becoming too vulnerable to Chinese economic and political influence and pressure will come under increasing scrutiny.

      "text": "The new children's commissioner for England wants to \"rebuild childhood\" after the disruption of the pandemic.\nDame Rachel de Souza says the scale of the challenge is like reconstructing the social security system in the wake of World War Two.\nShe also wants short-term measures - such as free school meals - being extended into the summer holidays, and not \"dropping\" Universal Credit levels.\nDame Rachel says she will be \"fearless\" in representing children's interests.\nThe new children's commissioner is launching what is claimed to be England's biggest survey of children - the \"Big Ask\" - which will gather children's views on the impact of the pandemic, and what they think are the barriers to children's ambitions\nThe online survey, to be sent to all schools and also children in youth custody, children's homes and mental health units, will provide information for a \"once-in-a-generation\" review of how children's lives might be improved.\nIt takes its \"spirit and the ambition\" from William Beveridge's 1942 report, which laid the foundations for the post-war welfare state, identifying the five great challenges as \"want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness\".\n\"Our response to the trauma of the Second World War was to create a blueprint for a social service system and a National Health Service that improved our lives. We have the chance to do the same again now for children,\" says the children's commissioner.\nDame Rachel, who ran schools in Norfolk and Suffolk, wants a 10-year plan to emerge from her review - with the promise of tackling a political system which can \"often short-change children\".\nFor more immediate challenges, on whether free school meals should run across the summer holidays, she told the BBC: \"I absolutely want to see free school meals extended.\n\"And I'm very concerned about suggestions of dropping Universal Credit. If it was dropped down again, I'd like to see services provided in its place, but I'd rather it wasn't dropped.\"\nA former teacher, head teacher and chief executive of a school academy trust, Dame Rachel promised to be an \"independent voice, there to fight to protect and promote the rights of children\".\nIf government was \"doing something wrong\", she said, \"I will be fearless in exposing that and challenging them\". \nThe review will consider how children will recover from so much disrupted education - calculating that collectively pupils in England have lost 840 million days of in-person schooling since the start of the pandemic, representing about 19 weeks each.\nIt will address the \"social fault lines\" and inequalities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, between generations, the wealthy and the disadvantaged, by ethnicity and geography.\nThis includes how the gulf between rich and poor and young and old has widened, with older, higher earners increasing their savings in the lockdown, while poorer families and younger people have faced job losses and increasingly fragile finances.\nToday's young people are the first post-war generation to be less well-off than their parents, says the report launching the children's commissioner's review.\n\"As we emerge from the Covid pandemic, this is the moment for something big, for children to recognise the sacrifices they have made,\" said Dame Rachel.\n\"I have seen first-hand the effect of this crisis on young people's hopes and dreams, and sometimes our answers simply have not been good enough.\"\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: \"Over the last decade the Conservatives have overseen record numbers of children being pushed into poverty, a worsening mental health crisis and an 18-month gap in learning between disadvantaged children and their peers at GCSE.\"\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We know that children and families have faced unprecedented challenges during the pandemic. \n\"We've expanded frontline charity support and provided new resources for schools and teachers to support children and young people's mental health.\n\"Our \u00a31.7bn investment in recovery support will help tackle the impact of any lost learning and we are investing an additional \u00a379m to increase the number of mental health support teams working with schools and colleges.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has outlined Scotland's latest timetable for the route out of its coronavirus lockdown - with the country's \"stay at home\" order to be lifted on 2 April. Three days later, hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. That date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality - find a detailed breakdown here.\nNorthern Ireland will also begin to ease coronavirus restrictions in April. Six people from two households will be able to meet in a private garden from 1 April, while groups of up to 10 will be allowed to take part in outdoor sports such as golf. From 12 April, the rules will be relaxed further, including the removal of the \"stay at home\" order. First Minister Arlene Foster also announced the return of P4-P7 primary school children (ages seven to 11) to classrooms from next Monday.\nThe first attendance figures since schools in England returned last week show high levels of pupils back in the classroom. In primary schools, 95% of pupils were in classes at the end of last week. The return has been staggered in secondary school to allow for Covid testing, but 89% of pupils were in last Monday - the highest proportion since the first lockdown began a year ago. When will all children in the UK be back in school?\nThe EU's medicines regulator says it remains \"firmly convinced\" that the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks. It reiterated that there was \"no indication\" the vaccine causes blood clots, after several leading EU countries paused their rollouts. France, Germany, Spain and Italy are among the countries seeking further clarification on its safety, amid criticism of their decision to suspend giving the jab. Find out more about the safety of Covid vaccines.\nCovid marshals, drones to monitor crowds, and a park-and-ride scheme are being brought in ahead of an expected influx of visitors to Bournemouth. Thousands of people flocked to the seaside resort when the first lockdown in England was eased last June and the council says it is expecting \"exceptional\" numbers when current coronavirus restrictions end.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nHead here to find out how the distribution of Covid vaccines is going around the world.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Pope Francis,Roman Catholic Church,LGBT",
      "text": "The Catholic Church does not have the power to bless same-sex unions, the Vatican office responsible for doctrine has said.\nIt is \"impossible\" for God to \"bless sin\", the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) said on Monday.\nBut the CDF did note the \"positive elements\" in same-sex relationships.\nIn October, Pope Francis indicated in a documentary that he thought same-sex couples should be allowed to have \"civil unions\".\nIn the Catholic Church, a blessing is given by a priest or other minister in the name of the Church.\nOn Monday, Pope Francis approved the response by the CDF, saying it was \"not intended to be a form of unjust discrimination, but rather a reminder of the truth of the liturgical rite\".\nSome parishes in recent months, including in Germany and the US, have started giving blessings to people in same-sex relationships as a way to welcome gay Catholics to the church, Reuters news agency reported.\nThe CDF's response was in answer to the question posed to it: \"Does the Church have the power to give the blessing to unions of persons of the same sex?\". It replied: \"Negative\".\nThe CDF noted that marriage between a man and a woman is sacrament and therefore blessings cannot be extended to same-sex couples.\n\"For this reason, it is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage (i.e., outside the indissoluble union of a man and a woman open in itself to the transmission of life), as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex,\" it said.\nIn defiant response, people posted photos from their same-sex weddings - including Chasten Buttigieg, husband of 2020 US presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.\nProgressive Catholic groups expressed their concern at the Vatican's declaration, too. \nCharlotte Clymer, from Catholics for Choice, tweeted: \"Being LGBTQ is not a choice. LGBTQ people are wonderfully made by God. We are born this way and perfectly so, regardless of what the Vatican or any other religious authority might claim.\"\nAnd Francis DeBernardo, executive director of gay Catholic group New Ways Ministry, said the Vatican's statement was \"not surprising, but still disappointing\".\nIn 2013, Pope Francis famously said: \"Who am I to judge gay people?\"\nLast year the pontiff said in a documentary by Evgeny Afineevsky that \"homosexual people have a right to be in a family... they are children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or made miserable over it\". \nThe Vatican later attempted to clarify the comments saying they were taken out of context and did not indicate support for same-sex marriage."

      "tags": "Companies,Gig economy,Employment,Pay,Uber,Self-employment",
      "text": "Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions.\nThe ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or \u00a38.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. \nIt comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. \nUber said it was \"turning the page\" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough.\nAnalysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK.\nWriting in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: \"This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. \n\"They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change.\"\nUnion leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it \"a very significant milestone\".  \nHowever, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. \nThe changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed.\nIn February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. \nIt argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. \nBut the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. \nUber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. \nThe company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. \nUber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling.\nThe company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. \nUber says:\nJamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: \"Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives.\n\"Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,\" he said.\nUber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension.\nThe company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly.\nBoss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was \"really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law\".\nBut she suggested Uber was trying to \"cherry pick\" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off.\nInstead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off.\nJames Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still \"short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%\". \n\"Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,\" they said.\nOthers pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. \nDespite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy.\nNigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: \"We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. \n\"And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'\"\nUber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they \"already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower\". \nHowever, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure \"any changes we make directly benefit them\".\nMary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean \"some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading\". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added.\nUnion leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. \"This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,\" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts.\n\"It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,\" Mr Rix said. \nUnion reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. \nAfter years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. \nAnd they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. \nOther gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. \nThe fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. \nUber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

      "text": "Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted.\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\nThat date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that \"brighter days are ahead of us\".\nThe \"stay at home\" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to \"stay local\" for a further three weeks.\nOther changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April.\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that:\nA decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept \"under ongoing review\".\nShe told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest.\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\".\nHowever, she said she was \"optimistic\" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues.\n\"This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,\" she said.\nRestrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or \"as soon as possible thereafter\".\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus.\nShe said that \"our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that\" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place \"for some time to come\".\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome.\nHowever, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments.\nAnd she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can \"get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear\".\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed \"effective testing and tracing\" systems to keep infections low.\nHe called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that \"transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close\".\nData not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland.\nThe first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored.\nWhen Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic.\nToday, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme.\nBut the first minister said this was the \"most hopeful\" she had felt for a long time and that \"something much closer to actual normality\" might be achieved as we move into summer.\nThe change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown.\nMs Sturgeon said the government had to make \"careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions\" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving \"steadily and in one direction\".\nThe final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the \"need for medium term-support\". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year.\nScottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was \"most welcome for everyone\", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission\", and that \"we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can\".\nScottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the \"indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area\".\nThe first minister said everything was \"predicated on the data going in the right direction\", and that \"all bets are off\" if case numbers rise sharply again.\nShe told MSPs that her \"hope and ambition\" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month."

      "title": "Covid-19: Continue using AstraZeneca vaccine, says WHO",
      "tags": "France,Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries not to pause Covid vaccinations, as several major EU member states halted their rollouts of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nIt said there was no evidence of a link between the vaccine and blood clots. \nGermany, France, Italy and Spain joined smaller nations in halting vaccinations as a precaution while checks are made.\nThe WHO's vaccine safety experts are meeting on Tuesday to discuss the jab. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) will meet on the same day and is due to draw conclusions on Thursday. It has also said the vaccine should continue to be used.\nThere have been a number of cases in Europe of blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered. \nHowever, experts say these were no more than the number of blood-clot incidents typically reported within the general population.\nAbout 17 million people in the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week, AstraZeneca said.\nGermany's health ministry announced on Monday that it would stop administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine with immediate effect, on the recommendation of the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), the country's authority on vaccines.\n\"The background to this decision follows new reports of cases of cerebral vein thrombosis connected with an AstraZeneca vaccination,\" Health Minister Jens Spahn said. \n\"In light of these newly reported cases, the Paul Ehrlich Institute today re-evaluated the situation and recommended a suspension of vaccinations and further analysis.\"\nHe said the decision was \"not political\". \"All of us are very aware of the consequences of this decision, and we did not take this decision lightly,\" he added.\nShortly afterwards, French President Emmanuel Macron said France was suspending the vaccine until new advice was given by the EMA.\n\"We have a simple guide, to be informed by science and the competent health authorities and to do it as part of a European strategy,\" he said.\nAnd Italy's medicines agency extended a ban introduced on individual batches of the vaccine throughout the country, also pending the EMA decision.\nSpanish Health Minister Carolina Darias said use of the vaccine would be suspended there for at least two weeks.\nThe suspensions came less than a day after the Netherlands did the same. Its suspension will last until at least 29 March. \nThe Irish Republic, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria, Iceland and Slovenia have also temporarily halted inoculations with the vaccine, while the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia have postponed the launch of their rollouts. \nSeveral European countries, including Austria, have suspended the use of certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. \nHowever, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nBelgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said that, with a high number of cases currently, Belgium could not afford to interrupt the rollout.\n\"For us, the balance is clear and clean, it's a race against time,\" he said.\nThailand announced that it would start using the vaccine on Tuesday, following a brief delay to the rollout over safety concerns. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said health experts had assured him all vaccines being administered in the country, including AstraZeneca's, were safe.\nWHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the body was investigating the reports. \n\"As soon as WHO has gained a full understanding of these events, the findings and any unlikely changes to current recommendations will be immediately communicated to the public,\" he said.\n\"As of today, there is no evidence that the incidents are caused by the vaccine and it is important that vaccination campaigns continue so that we can save lives and stem severe disease from the virus.\" \nThe EMA - which is also currently carrying out a review into incidents of blood clots - said the vaccine could continue to be administered. \nThe UK medicines regulator also said evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots, as it urged people in the country to get the vaccine when asked to do so. \nProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group that developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, told the BBC's Today programme there was \"very reassuring evidence that there is no increase in a blood clot phenomenon here in the UK, where most of the doses in Europe [have] been given so far\".\nWhile vast numbers of people are being vaccinated at pace around the world, some of them will still get sick with other things unrelated to the vaccine. \nThese pauses for the AstraZeneca vaccine are not because it is unsafe to give. It's to allow time for experts to explore why a small number of people who were recently given the shot also developed blood clots.\nWhen an illness occurs shortly after vaccination, it is right to question whether the shot might have contributed in any way. \nThere is no indication or evidence, however, that the vaccine was linked or responsible. \nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring. Europe's drug regulator has also backed the vaccine, saying its benefits are clear. Covid can be deadly and vaccination saves lives. \nIt said there was no evidence of an increased risk of clotting due to the vaccine. \nIt said that across the EU and United Kingdom there had been 15 events of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) - a blood clot in a vein - and 22 events of pulmonary embolism - a blood clot that has entered the lungs - reported among those vaccinated.\nAstraZeneca said these figures were \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines\".  \n\"The nature of the pandemic has led to increased attention in individual cases and we are going beyond the standard practices for safety monitoring of licensed medicines in reporting vaccine events, to ensure public safety,\" Ann Taylor, the firm's chief medical officer, said.

      "title": "Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A number of countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution following reports that some people have suffered blood clots after being given the jab.\nBut is it a case of being too cautious? Are these nations missing the bigger picture?\nThe decision has been made on the basis of the precautionary principle - a well-established approach in science and medicine that stresses the need to pause and review when evidence is uncertain.\nBut in a fast-moving pandemic, when each decision can have major consequences, it is an approach which can sometimes do more harm than good.\nThe data supplied by AstraZeneca shows there have been 37 reports of blood clots among the 17m people across Europe who have been given the vaccine. \nBut the key question that has to be asked is whether this is cause or coincidence? Would these clots have happened anyway? \nAdverse events like this are monitored carefully, so regulators can assess if they are happening more than they should.\nThe 37 reports of clots are below the level you would expect. What is more, there is no strong biological explanation why the vaccine would cause a blood clot. \nIt is why the World Health Organization and UK drugs regulators have all said there is no evidence of a link.\nEven the European Medicines Agency, which is looking into the reports, has suggested the vaccine should continue to be used in the meantime given the risk Covid presents to health.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the decisions by individual nations to pause their rollouts have baffled experts.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the WHO's working group on Covid vaccines, says stopping rollout in this way is \"highly undesirable\" and could undermine confidence in the vaccine, costing lives in the long-term.\n\"Making the right call in situations like this is not easy, but having a steady hand on the tiller is probably what is needed most.\"\nThis is not the first time countries in Europe have exercised caution about the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe precautionary principle was adopted by Germany, France and others when they did not initially recommend use of the vaccine for the over-65s. French President Emmanuel Macron even called it \"quasi-ineffective\".\nThe over 65s decision has now been reversed, but the impact is still being felt it seems.\nGermany and France have supplies of the vaccine going to waste, with both countries having used fewer than half their supplies of the AstraZeneca jab so far. It has left them far more reliant on the Pfizer vaccine than the UK is.\nAnd this is threatening to have deadly consequences. France, Germany and the other major European nations all have higher rates of infection than the UK, and face the prospect of things getting worse before they get better.\nIf you look back at the decision on the over-65s, you can see how it was made. The way the trials had been organised meant there was limited evidence on its use in older age groups.\nThe organisers had wanted to recruit younger adults in the initial stages for safety reasons, so when it came to regulators assessing infection rates the data was not yet ready for older people.\nBut there was evidence from blood samples that the vaccine had prompted a strong immune response in the older age groups. So there was no reason why the vaccine would not work in older age groups - it was just that insufficient time had passed to gather the evidence in the real world.\nThere was also a problem interpreting results because of the way the trial was run. There was a lack of consistency across the different sites used. \nProtocols and practices followed varied across each, including the use of a half-dose in one.\nSome have described it as four trials within a trial. It created a somewhat messy set of data to interpret.\nThe UK looked past this and took the leap though - and within months was reporting \"spectacular\" results in reduced levels of serious illness in the over-80s.\nIt was this pragmatic approach to decision-making that also led the UK to recommend up to a three-month gap between doses.\nThis caused much controversy when it was announced at the end of December.\nThe Pfizer vaccine was not tested like this in trials - the interval was three weeks.\nBut again, the absence of evidence did not mean the move would not work or was not based on logic. \nThe AstraZeneca trials did have longer intervals for some participants, which seemed to make it more effective, while evidence on the Moderna vaccine, which is a similar type of jab to Pfizer, also suggested it could work.\nIt is also well-established that with two-dose vaccines, most of the protection is provided by the first dose, while the second boosts that and provides more long-lasting protection. \nWith cases rising rapidly at the time, the UK was clear the benefit of maximising available vaccine supplies to provide some protection to more people was the right step even if the trial evidence did not directly support it.\nProf Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in understanding risk at Cambridge University, says it shows that sometimes you have to look beyond the precautionary principle and be bold in your decision-making.\n\"The precautionary principle favours inaction as a way of reducing risk. But the problem is that these are not normal times and inaction can be more risky than action.\"\nWhat is needed in circumstances like these, according to Sir David, is to work out what is most likely on the balance of probability. That requires looking at both the direct and indirect evidence and the context those decisions are being made in.\n\"Sometimes it can be harmful to wait for certainty. Not vaccinating people will costs lives.\" "

      "tags": "Simon Hart,Home Office,Penally,Refugees and asylum seekers,Tenby,Ministry of Defence",
      "text": "An Army camp housing asylum seekers in Pembrokeshire is set to close within days, a UK government minister says.\nIt comes after inspectors said the camp at Penally and Napier Barracks in Kent were \"run-down and unsuitable\".\nThe Home Office said it gave \"safe and secure accommodation for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute\".\nWelsh Secretary Simon Hart said the Home Office had agreed to return Penally to the Ministry of Defence by 21 March.\nBBC Wales has been told the remaining asylum seekers will be gradually moved out before then. \nThe Home Office decided to house up to 250 asylum seekers at Penally from September last year.\nBut some people housed at the camp claimed the conditions were unsafe and it had put them at risk of coronavirus.\nVideo footage and photographs of the camp, seen by BBC Wales, appeared to show bathroom floors covered with water, every toilet in one bathroom blocked, and beds in communal rooms positioned less than 2m (6ft) apart.\nHowever, the Home Office had said it was safe and \"Covid-compliant\".\nIt also attracted protests from people living in the area and complaints about costs incurred by Pembrokeshire council and Dyfed-Powys Police. \nIn a letter to local residents, Mr Hart said he was \"deeply conscious\" that the manner in which the use of Penally for asylum seekers had come about \"caused much frustration and anger\".\nHe said while the Home Office recognised this, it stressed it \"had little option at the time\". \nThe Welsh Labour government and Plaid Cymru had previously called for the camp to be closed. \nPlaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts MP claimed it was \"thanks to the hard work of Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn and councillor Jon Preston that the Home Office finally bowed to pressure and agreed to close the camp - but it should have never come to this\".\nShe added: \"The institutional failures of the Home Office over Penally camp are a scandal that must not be brushed under the carpet. We now need binding guarantees that a situation like this can never happen again.\u00a0\n\"We need an asylum system that puts the welfare of those seeking asylum first, and for communities to be at the heart of decision making.\"\nMr Llywelyn added: \"The Home Office's use of the camp, especially during a global pandemic, has put immense strain on local people, services and the residents themselves. \nNaomi Phillips, director of policy and advocacy at the British Red Cross, said military barracks were \"completely inappropriate and inhumane as housing for people fleeing war, persecution and violence\". \nThe Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants called the closure \"amazing news\" and said the Home Office now \"must shut Napier barracks too\". \n\"No-one should have been placed in these inhumane Covid traps in the first place,\" it added. \nThe Home Office said Penally \"provided emergency capacity in response to pressures put on the asylum estate during Covid\". \nIt added: \"As those pressures have eased we have decided not to extend emergency planning permission beyond six months. Napier will remain in operation in accordance with current needs.  \n\"The home secretary will soon bring forward her plan to fix our broken asylum system and that plan will address the government's asylum estate.\""

      "text": "\"We were walking innocently into the future with no idea what was coming,\" says Nica Burns, chief executive of Nimax Theatres.\nOn 16 March last year, she was watching a preview of the musical City of Angels that was due to open at the firm's Garrick Theatre.\n\"We knew we had something special,\" she said.\nWithin a couple of hours, cast and crew gathered in the bar for a sudden goodbye, sharing pizzas and drinks with colleagues they thought they would see in a few weeks' time.\nThat night, all theatres shut due to Covid-19. For most, their stages have been in darkness ever since.\n\"The last year for theatre has been hell... You couldn't have made it up in a play, a musical or a dream,\" Ms Burns told the BBC.\nLike others, Nimax's costs have mounted but little cash has come in during lockdown.\nA new survey by industry body UK Theatre found that 95% of 944 theatre venues, producers and businesses were worse off financially due to the pandemic. And 16 organisations reported losses of more than \u00a35m in the last year.\nIn the last 18 months, Ms Burns estimates Nimax has made a loss of about \u00a320m. At its peak last August, 339 staff members were on furlough. \nIt also suffered a number of false starts. \nAbout 25,000 audience members managed to see a show when its theatres, which host Six and Everybody's Talking About Jamie, were allowed to reopen last Christmas. But closing them again under fresh lockdown restrictions cost \u00a3250,000.\nDespite that, the theatre boss plans to reopen all six sites from 17 May at 50% capacity, under the government's \"roadmap\" for lifting restrictions.\nWith social distancing measures in place, Nimax theatres will either make a small loss or break even, Ms Burns says.\n\"For larger shows, such as Harry Potter or Hamilton - that just wouldn't be viable. They need to spend months marketing, see if cast are available, start rehearsals...\"\nBut she says of her, mostly medium-sized, venues: \"It is much better for us to be open, there's no doubt.\"\n\"With ticket sales coming in, we'll be making a contribution to overheads and will be able to avoid dipping into our reserves.\"\n\"But the other great thing about it is we can give a whole lot of people their jobs back,\" she adds.\nHaving cut down costs by renegotiating with suppliers, as well as making use of furlough and a \u00a35m coronavirus business interruption loan, Ms Burns says the firm is on a \"strong footing\" coming out of the crisis.\n\"We had a very successful business brought to its knees - but we're ready to go out and fight.\"\nJulian Bird, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, describes the pandemic's impact as \"devastating\" for firms across the country.\n\"We saw an existential threat come out of nowhere that has had a completely dramatic effect in shutting down our industry... an industry that relies on people coming into an auditorium, paying for a ticket and watching a production.\"\nWithout government support such as the Culture Recovery Fund or business rates holidays for theatres, many more would have \"gone to the wall\".\nBut a lack of insurance for Covid-related cancellations means commercial producers and theatre owners have been left shouldering big financial risks coming out of lockdown.\nUK Theatre is pushing for an \"indemnity scheme\" that would stand behind losses in the event of coronavirus-related shutdowns or cast or crew getting ill. A similar scheme exists for film and TV productions.\nHe points to the huge losses theatres and investors made in December when pantomimes and other shows closed due to rising Covid cases.\nWithout additional support, he says: \"We won't see big shows, big UK tours coming back quickly - that's the big risk.\"\nAnd the economic impact could be huge, Mr Bird argues.\n\"What you see on-stage is the product of many companies: the suppliers of sound, lighting, video technology, wig-makers, costumes - and that's a microcosm.\"\n\"We have our own ecosystem in the theatre world\", which fits into a wider supply chain. It's estimated theatre generates more than \u00a31.2bn in VAT for the Treasury from ticket sales, as well as related coach trips, hotel bookings and meals in restaurants.\nMr Bird is confident, though, that the show will go on, despite the last year being \"incredibly difficult\".\nAnd the industry may face a shake-up on its return, due to a focus on the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as a \"realisation a lot of people who make up the industry are self-employed or freelance,\" he says.\nAlice Fearn watched the government coronavirus briefing on her phone as she travelled on the bus to the Phoenix Theatre in London's West End.\nLast 16 March, the actress from South London was just five weeks into a year-long contract playing a lead role in the musical Come From Away. \nHaving seen that Broadway shows were forced to shut the week before, \"that made me think we were next,\" she says.\nThe cast gathered on-stage for a warm-up at the usual time of 18:15. \"I had a full face of make-up, other girls had their hair in pin curls ready to get their wigs on,\" says Alice. \nBut the production was halted that evening due to the new Covid restrictions. One year on, Alice hasn't returned to the theatre and has used about half of her savings to pay bills.\nAlthough she has been self-employed for a number of years, she was not eligible for Universal Credit or the government's Self-Employed Income Support Scheme because of her previous earnings in a higher-paying role, playing Elphaba in Wicked.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the same rule has disqualified about 225,000 people.\nDespite being excluded from government support, Alice feels fortunate she has been able to make ends meet by giving talks at performing arts colleges and singing lessons.\n\"My career is completely theatre-based, or live gigging\u2026 I was part of a world where everything closed down... I made myself available for absolutely everything that came in.\"\nWhile she's excited for the industry's return, she says: \"I think the roadmap has given me more anxiety. How do we know it's real and going to exist the way it's written?\n\"None of us have done shows for a year. We need to market them, rehearse them... that's costly and if they are cancelled again that's just money down the drain.\n\"I want the industry to come back - but I want it back for good.\""

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to have authorised attempts to influence last year's US election in favour of former President Donald Trump, intelligence officials say.\nMoscow spread \"misleading or unsubstantiated allegations\" about the eventual winner, Joe Biden, according to a US government report.\nBut it said no foreign government had compromised the final results.\nRussia called the allegations of election interference \"baseless\".\n\"The conclusions of the report... are confirmed solely by the confidence of the intelligence services of their self-righteousness,\" the Russian embassy in Washington said in a statement. \"No facts or specific evidence of such claims were provided.\"\nThe US is expected to impose sanctions on Russia as soon as next week over the report's conclusions, three sources told Reuters news agency.\nThe 15-page report, released on Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, outlined what it said were \"influence operations\" pushed by Russia as well as Iran.\nIt said Russian-linked individuals had spread unsubstantiated claims about President Biden ahead of the 3 November election. It also said a disinformation campaign sought to undermine confidence in the broader election process.\nSome people connected to Russian intelligence also pushed anti-Biden narratives to media outlets, senior officials and allies of Mr Trump, the report said.\nPresident Biden defeated Mr Trump and was inaugurated on 20 January.\nThe report added that, while Russia had sought to boost Mr Trump's chances of victory, Iran had launched a \"multi-pronged covert influence campaign\" in an effort to weaken his support.\nThe former president pursued a policy of \"maximum pressure\" on Iran, imposing damaging sanctions and escalating a war of words between the two nations.\nThe report also concluded with \"high confidence\" that China, which has long been accused of cyber-espionage by Washington, chose not to \"deploy interference efforts\" ahead of the vote.\n\"China sought stability in its relationship with the United States and did not view either election outcome as being advantageous enough for China to risk blowback if caught,\" it said.\nAccording to the report, the voting process and final results were not interfered with by foreign states.\nThe intelligence report was released at the same time as a joint investigation by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security which came to a similar conclusion. \nTheir report said \"broad Russian and Iranian campaigns targeting multiple critical infrastructure sectors did compromise the security of several networks that managed some election functions\".\nBut it emphasised that the alleged interference attempts were largely indirect.\n\"We have no indications that any foreign actor attempted to interfere... by altering any technical aspect of the voting process, including voter registration, ballot casting, vote tabulation, or reporting results,\" the document reads.\nThe US intelligence community said last August that China, Russia and Iran were actively trying to meddle in the forthcoming presidential election.\nThe assessment found that Russia was seeking to \"denigrate\" Mr Biden. It also found that China and Iran wanted Mr Trump to lose the vote.\nAnalysis by Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nUS intelligence officials accuse Russia of making \"unsubstantiated allegations\" about Mr Biden, but research shows the dominant drivers of misinformation about the election were closer to home. \nMr Trump and his supporters consistently promoted unfounded claims about widespread voter fraud on social media before, during and after the election.\nMany accused Mr Trump of deliberately trying to undermine faith in the election process - the same allegation now being levelled at Russia.\nHow much do the American intelligence agencies think the Russian operation boosted the former president's effort? The declassified report, scant on detail, doesn't really say.\nIf the goal of the alleged influence campaigns was to sway the vote in Mr Trump's favour, it clearly failed.\nBut operations that seek to create confusion and stoke division are a tool that countries will continue to use - and not only during elections. \nThe Washington riots on 6 January, though not driven by a foreign power, provided a powerful example of how misinformation spread online can threaten democracy and result in real-world violence."

      "text": "Bakery chain Greggs is to open 100 new shops in 2021 as it bets on a post-pandemic recovery.\nThis is despite the chain reporting its first loss for 36 years in 2020 after sales fell by a third amid coronavirus lockdown measures.\nGreggs said it had ramped up deliveries, wholesale, and click-and-collect as High Street sales fell.\nChief executive Roger Whiteside added that Greggs had \"made a better-than-expected start to 2021\".\nHe added that the chain was \"well placed to participate in the recovery from the pandemic\".\nSales at company-managed shops fell by more than 36% last year as footfall in city centres and travel hub sites fell substantially during lockdowns.\nThis was partly offset by deliveries through Just Eat, which is one of the world's biggest food delivery platforms.\nGreggs reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a313.7m, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984.\nNevertheless, the chain is planning to open about 100 net new shops this year, adding to the 2,078 it already operates.\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pandemic \"tore a huge chunk off business as it turned once bustling city centres into ghost towns\".\n\"Although the crisis is likely to prove a temporary interruption to our insatiable demand for sausage rolls rather than a sign of dramatically changing tastes, it is quite a sustained break, and it's going to take a toll. Greggs has previously said it doesn't expect a return to pre-Covid levels of operations until 2022 at the earliest.\"\nJohn Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: \"The High Street is likely to be a very different place when lockdown restrictions are fully ended, with many empty spaces and chains such as Pret re-focusing on suburban areas - the traditional heartland of Greggs.\n\"While these factors cannot be underestimated, the company is in good shape, with a solid balance sheet, and has a great record of rising to the challenge.\"\nGreggs chairman Ian Durant said 2020 was \"not the year that any of us planned for\".\nHe said the firm had started the year strongly but then temporarily closed its shops in March due to the Covid outbreak. It then reopened shops in the middle of the year.\nTo get through the pandemic, Greggs arranged financing both from the government, which it has since repaid, and from lenders.\n\"Government support has been essential to mitigate the impact of Covid and protect as many jobs as possible through this period,\" Mr Durant said.\nHe said it had been \"sad to say goodbye\" to staff whose roles had been cut by the firm \"to reflect the reality of the trading environment\"."

      "text": "France is to return a painting by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt to the heirs of the Jewish family that was forced to sell it by the Nazis.\nFrench culture minister Roselyne Bachelot said restoring it to its rightful owners was an acknowledgement of the crimes they suffered.\nShe said the painting bore witness to the \"broken lives\" of the Nazi era.\nThe French state bought the work, its only Klimt, in 1980 without realising its history.\nThe pre-war owner of Rosiers sous les Arbres (Rose Bushes Under the Trees) was Nora Stiasny, from a well-known Austrian Jewish family. She had inherited it from her uncle, the Austrian industrialist and art collector Viktor Zuckerkandl, Ms Bachelot told a news conference at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\nMs Stiasny was forced to sell it in August 1938 at a knock-down price to survive financially, months after the Nazis annexed Austria.\nIn 1942 Ms Stiasny was deported to a concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, and died the same year.\nThe art dealer held on to the masterpiece until his death in the 1960s. France bought it at auction in 1980 for the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. \n\"Today we know that it is indeed a work that was looted in Austria in August 1938,\" Ms Bachelot told reporters.\n\"The decision we've taken is of course a difficult one. It results in taking a masterpiece out of the national collections which is the only painting by Gustav Klimt which France owned.\n\"But this decision is necessary, essential. Eighty-three years after the forced sale of this painting by Nora Stiasny, this is the accomplishment of an act of justice.\"\nThe beneficiaries will be the descendants of Nora Stiasny's sister. The French government will have to pass a bill to allow it to be released from the national collection and returned to the family, Ms Bachelot added.\nIn 2017 a floral Gustav Klimt painting was sold for nearly \u00a348m at Sotheby's in London.\nIn 2020, Claudia Maga told how, as an art student, she discovered that a portrait by Klimt had been painted over another work by the artist which had not been seen since 1912."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People aged 50 or over in Northern Ireland can now book their Covid-19 vaccine appointment, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.\nThose who are eligible and wish to receive the vaccine can booking it online or be contacted by their GPs.\nBooking slots are available at the seven regional vaccination centres.\nThere was some frustration about the length of time some people were having to wait in the queue to book their slot on Monday.\nHowever, Mr Swann told the assembly that in the first three hours of the slots opening 30,000 people had booked vaccines. \nThe centres will primarily be using the AstraZeneca vaccine for first doses, to maximise available vaccine supplies.\nAnyone who received the Pfizer vaccine as a first dose will still receive the Pfizer vaccine for their second dose.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister told the assembly that the \"benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks\".\nIt comes after health officials in Northern Ireland said they would continue to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after its suspension in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe temporary suspension of the vaccine is already having an impact on the republic's immunisation programme. \nAbout 30,000 vaccination appointments for health staff and those at high-risk might be delayed, according to RT\u00c9.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly described its move as \"precautionary\", after reports of serious blood clotting events in adults in Norway. \nAstraZeneca has said there is no evidence of a link between the vaccine and increased risk of clotting, while Northern Ireland's Department of Health has said it would continue to use the vaccine after receiving guidance from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nThe latest figures show that across Northern Ireland 629,461 people have now received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 54,636 have received two.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health recorded a further 121 cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nOne additional death was reported, bringing the department's total number of deaths with Covid-19 to 2,099.\nFor a second day in a row, no additional deaths were reported in the Republic of Ireland, where there have a total of 4,534 Covid-19-related deaths.\nThe Republic of Ireland's health department said there were 575 more confirmed cases, which brings that total to 227,316.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister said vaccination was a \"bridge to better, safer and more normal times for everyone\".\nChief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the more people are vaccinated then \"the more we are all protected\".\nHe received his first jab on Monday morning.\n\"Vaccination alone will not provide 100% protection but it will change the balance in our favour against this virus. \n\"When your turn comes, don't delay, get the jab. Protect yourself and others,\" he said.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster also urged those eligible to take up the offer of a vaccine.\n\"The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) have been very clear that it is safe to take the AstraZeneca vaccine,\" said the DUP leader.\n\"I am looking forward to taking it, either this week or next week, depending on when I am able to get my vaccine booked for, but it is very important that people continue to take the vaccine.\"\nOn Monday, Dr Alan Stout, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) NI GP committee, said it was the large supply of AstraZeneca jab that allowed the vaccination programme to continue at the speed it is. \nHe advised people that it was safe to receive, and there was also a risk of blood clotting with things like long-haul air travel, the contraception pill, and some forms of surgery. \n\"These are world experts that we have in these regulators bodies and they are all saying the same thing, and they are all saying it is safe,\" he said. \nDr Stout said he was \"hopeful\" jabs would be offered to the over-40s age group by Easter, mirroring the situation reportedly happening elsewhere in the UK. \nHow bizarre. \nWhile health officials in the Republic of Ireland are choosing to pause the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, in Northern Ireland they're accelerating the programme. So who should we trust?\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) the vaccine is safe. That message has been reinforced by the British Medical Association.\nIt's hard to ignore that the MHRA has said that it has received a small number of reports of blood clots relating to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nBut it does seem that health officials in the Republic are being excessively cautious - Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and the country's deputy chief medical officer have said as much themselves. \nRelations between the EU and AstraZeneca are somewhat toxic at present with the Republic of Ireland, where the vaccine is reportedly in short supply, having been let down so many times on delivery of the vaccine. \nWhile people in the Republic will be rolling down their sleeves, in Northern Ireland an even greater number are preparing to roll them up.\nThe rollout will continue to be prioritised based on age, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance aimed at protecting the most vulnerable, the Department of Health has said.\nVaccines are being dispensed in parallel by GP practices and vaccination centres. \nNorthern Ireland has seven regional vaccination centres: Royal Victoria Hospital, Ulster Hospital, South Lake Leisure Centre, Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Foyle Arena,  Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre.\nPlans are also being finalised for community pharmacies to join the programme in the coming weeks, the department added. \nAn additional regional mass vaccination centre will open at the end of March at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\nThe vaccination centres are now offering bookings to: \nCarers who have not already booked a vaccination appointment can email their health trust carer co-ordinators and they will make the necessary arrangements.\nGPs are providing vaccines to: \nThe latter clinically vulnerable (CV) group is expected to largely mirror those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.  \nCEV and CV individuals aged 16 and 17 years of age cannot receive the vaccine being used in GP practices.\nThese individuals will receive a letter from their GP and are able to book a vaccination slot at one of the vaccination centres.\nPeople who want to book a vaccination centre appointment are asked to do so online if it all possible.\nIf online booking is not possible, then the telephone booking number is 0300 200 7813.\nThe booking line is open 08:00 GMT until 20:00 Monday to Friday."

      "text": "\"Immediate steps\" aimed at improving safety for women and girls in England and Wales have been announced by No 10 after Sarah Everard's death.\nAmong them is an additional \u00a325m for better lighting and CCTV as well as a pilot scheme which would see plain-clothes officers in pubs and clubs.\nCampaigners say the money is not enough and called for institutional changes.\nLabour said meaningful changes to law are needed rather than plans involving \"police officers in skinny jeans\".\nIt comes after hundreds of people protested in central London on Monday.\nMs Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\nHer body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old marketing executive's kidnap and murder.\nFollowing a meeting of the government's Crime and Justice Taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take \"immediate steps\" to give \"further reassurance\" to women and girls in the wake of the killing of Ms Everard.\nNo 10 said it would double the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to \u00a345m.\nUndercover police will be sent to clubs, bars and popular nightspots to relay intelligence about predatory or suspicious offenders to uniformed officers, in pilots of so-called Project Vigilant, rolled out across the country.\nSafeguarding minister Victoria Atkins said undercover officers working in the night-time economy would feed intelligence to uniformed officers.\nShe said the government would work with businesses and police to ensure, as the industry reopened following the coronavirus lockdown, \"that women can feel safe in our streets\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in \"landmark legislation\" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets.\nHe said: \"Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them.\"\nBut Labour's shadow domestic violence minister Jess Phillips told BBC Breakfast that in her years of experience, she had not come across experts or victims calling for more CCTV in public spaces.\nShe accused ministers of being \"caught on the hop\" and rolling out plans involving \"police officers in skinny jeans\" rather than meaningful changes to legislation regarding street harassment, or a detailed review of how rape is prosecuted in England and Wales.\nThe shadow home secretary, Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the measures were \"nowhere near good enough\" and called for \"urgent action\" on issues like harassment of women, domestic homicide sentencing and more support for victims of rape.\nLabour MP Stella Creasy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more funding for better street lighting was not unwelcome, but \"it really just doesn't understand what the issues are\". She said measures focused on policing nightspots do not recognise \"that women get abused, assaulted and intimidated in all sorts of places\".\nDr Ellie Cosgrave, a lecturer in urban innovation and policy at University College London, said it was right that the government consider lighting as a way to help make cities safer, but added: \"You can't just shove a light in and hope that the public space will be better.\"\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that \"over-lighting\" some areas in a city can make other areas feel less safe.\nDr Cosgrave said the best action ministers can take to make cities safer is to understand the \"social dynamics\" of an area by conducting surveys, speaking to people, and implementing change based on what they say.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast it was good news that more women were feeling more confident to report rape allegations, but he added \"we still haven't done well enough to get the evidence that can secure convictions\". \nA spokeswoman for organisation Reclaim These Streets said it welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were \"so important\".\n\"Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,\" she said.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel had warned against holding vigils, and has launched a review into the policing of a gathering over the weekend in south London in memory of Ms Everard.\nDuring that event, officers handcuffed and removed several women after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects.\nOn Monday, hundreds marched across central London in what was said to be a meeting by Sisters Uncut, which describes itself as an \"intersectional feminist direct-action collective\", with many of those in attendance carrying placards.\nFour people were arrested - three on suspicion of breaching coronavirus regulations and a fourth on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker. A further two people were issued with fixed penalty notices, the Metropolitan Police said.\nProtests will be able to legally resume on 29 March, when the coronavirus \"stay at home\" order lifts in England.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said demonstrations will continue to be subject to Covid-secure precautions such as appropriate measures to maintain social distancing.\nMeanwhile, MPs will continue debating the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill later, which would change how protests are managed, including allowing police to impose conditions such as start and finish times.\nLabour has criticised the bill saying it did \"nothing to help women feel safer\", and imposed \"disproportionate\" controls on freedom of speech.\nMs Patel said the bill would end the halfway release of those convicted of sexual offences such as rape and also said the Domestic Abuse bill was on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, which she said would \"transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime\"."

      "text": "A public inquiry into the Welsh government's handling of Covid-19 needs to be held when the \"pandemic is behind us\", the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford said the outbreak did not have to be \"all over\" before an investigation was held.\nBut he said ministers needed to be \"confident that we are emerging from it unambiguously\".\nThe Conservatives said they would hold an inquiry as soon as possible if in power after May's Senedd election.\nPlaid Cymru said a Wales-specific inquiry \"must begin while memories are fresh\".\nOn the anniversary of the first reported death with coronavirus in Wales, Mr Drakeford has announced the creation of two new woodlands \"as permanent living memorials to all those who have died\".\nThe exact locations of the two sites will be announced in the coming weeks, with one in the north and one in the south.\nOn Monday, Public Health Wales reported a total of 5,454 Covid-19 deaths in Wales.\nBut the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show Covid was mentioned on 7,592 death certificates up to 26 February.\nThe ONS data gives a bigger picture and includes deaths where Covid is confirmed or suspected by doctors and covers deaths in all settings, including care homes, hospices and people's homes.\nAn assessment of the number of deaths from all causes compared with what we would normally expect to see shows there were 5,447 deaths more than the five-year average.\nWhen looking at death rates in local areas, Wales has four areas in the worst 20 across England and Wales - Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, and Neath Port Talbot.\nThe first minister said Covid-19 would \"leave a mark that will last for many years\".\nHe said that was because of the thousands of families who have lost somebody during the pandemic, but also because of the way it would \"change the way we think about our own futures, about the way we work, about the precautions we take when global events of this sort can have such a profound impact on us locally\".\nLast June, Welsh ministers agreed an independent inquiry should be held into their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \nBut the government said it should be part of a probe into the response to the crisis across the UK.\nMinisters did not commit to a timetable for an investigation despite opposition parties' calls at the time for the inquiry to report before May's Senedd election.\nAsked when an inquiry might be held, Mark Drakeford said: \"It needs to be at the point when we can be confident that the pandemic is behind us. \n\"I don't mean necessarily all over, but we are confident that we are emerging from it unambiguously.\n\"And then it needs to be an inquiry that is not simply Welsh because so much of what has happened to us in Wales has been linked to the wider UK picture. \n\"So, it needs to be at a time when we can draw all those threads together and then it will be absolutely right that we look back and learn the lessons of what has taken place,\" he added.\nThe Welsh Conservatives have said there should be inquiries \"at both a UK and a Wales level\", with the party committing to one in Wales after the election if they are in power.\nRaising the issue at First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Tory group leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"I want to see a public inquiry as soon as possible make progress and, rather than lose it in a wider UK public inquiry, have a Wales-specific public inquiry.\" \nIn reply, Mr Drakeford said he felt a Wales-only inquiry \"would not be able to grapple with a long list of issues that will be fundamental to being able to draw the lessons from what has happened\".\nHe said a UK-wide public inquiry \"will, absolutely properly, look at the decision making of the Welsh Government as well.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"No-one can say when this pandemic will be behind us, so Wales must not be kept waiting to learn the lessons of the last year. \n\"In those 12 months we saw a failure to ensure universal testing of care home residents, failure to provide adequate PPE for health and care staff, and a failure to utilise Welsh testing capacity when it was most needed.\""

The company plans to launch a new version of it in 2023.\nFord Otosan, a joint venture between the American giant and Turkish company Ko\u00e7 Holding, will manufacture the new van at its plant in Kocaeli, in Northwestern Turkey.\nDagenham will build diesel engines for the new model - which will also be available as an electric van, as well as in various hybrid forms.\nAlthough moves to electrify passenger cars are proceeding rapidly, Ford says it expects diesel to continue to play an important role in commercial vehicles for many years.\nDemand from Ford Otosan, which will also build a similar-sized van on behalf of Volkswagen, is expected to account for up to 60% of Dagenham's diesel engine production by 2025.\nFord said the trade agreement reached between Turkey and the UK in late 2020 was \"extremely significant\" for its business - pointing out that Ford and Ford Otosan together account for more than 10% of the trade volume between the two countries.\nFord closed its Bridgend plant last year, as part of a drastic overhaul of its European business. \nThe factory, which opened in 1977, was unable to obtain enough new work after two major engine programmes ended in 2019.\nFive other factories in Europe were also shut, and some 10,000 workers were laid off.\nTransit vans were once built at a plant near Southampton, but in 2013 the factory was closed and production was moved to Turkey, where Ford said production costs were much lower.\nThe International Trade Minister, Ranil Jayawardena, described Ford's announcement as \"great news for Ford and its 7,500 workers across the United Kingdom\"."

      "tags": "Companies,Gambling",
      "text": "A group of MPs has written to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling for a public inquiry into the collapse of gambling website Football Index.\nThey say it is \"a scandal\" and shows the need to reform the gambling sector.\nThe firm has suspended operations and appointed administrators, sparking an outcry from punters whose money is still locked up in the business.\nThere are reports gamblers could lose more than \u00a390m, with some now seeking legal advice about possible claims.\nIn their letter, the MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gambling Related Harm estimate that Football Index punters have lost \u00a33,000 each on average. \n\"This can only be termed a scandal,\" said chair Carolyn Harris. \"It underlines the need for wholesale reform of the gambling industry and raises significant questions of the Gambling Commission, given they saw fit to licence this platform and failed to enact adequate oversight.\"\nNot only does there need to be a urgent inquiry, it is more evidence of the need to create a Gambling Ombudsman to help protect consumers, she said. \nBen, aged 22, estimates the collapse in the value of his Football Index portfolio will cost him close to \u00a36,500. \n\"I feel embarrassed and cheated,\" he told the BBC. \"The crash has affected me mentally.\"\nHe lives at home and has no dependents, so thinks he got off lightly. \"There are people out there with families who have been hit a lot worse; lost far more than me.\n\"I'll never trust Football Index again. I will go elsewhere and enjoy my love of football with other companies and probably bet in a more conventional way. But it will make me think twice before putting money into other companies. \n\"Everyone affected by this wants to say how disappointed they are with the leadership of Football Index.\" Punters feel the company has \"stitched up their loyal fan base\", he said.\nRead more about the young gamblers who lost thousands.\nFootball Index hit serious financial problems earlier this month. The company cut dividend pay-outs on players, sparking a crash in their \"share\" price value. \nThis change in the terms and conditions meant the value of gamblers' portfolios plummeted, with many users taking to social media to report losses of thousands of pounds  - even tens of thousands.\nSeveral punters contacted the BBC with reports of the impact on their finances, and called for action against the company and the regulator, the Gambling Commission.\nA group of gamblers has formed an action group, and on Tuesday it was announced that law firm Leigh Day is looking into possible legal action against Football Index parent company BetIndex on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money.\nLeigh Day partner Nichola Marshall said the role of the Gambling Commission will also come under scrutiny. \nMs Marshall said: \"Whilst it is very early days in our investigations on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money, there are serious questions which will need answering regarding what has happened at Football Index and what the Gambling Commission understood of Football Index's activities.\"\nMatt Zarb-Cousin of the Clean Up Gambling campaign, who is working with Football Index customers and Leigh Day, said: \"Football Index ended up in a situation where they needed new customers to honour the dividend payments to existing users. \n\"It was a business run in an entirely unsustainable way, which people do not expect of a licensed operator in a regulated sector. The Gambling Commission has been asleep at the wheel.\"\nFast-growing Football Index launched in 2015 and allowed users to buy what it called \"shares\" in professional footballers. The firm paid users \"dividends\" according to player performances. \nIf a player performed well or transferred to a bigger club, the transfer value went up and so did the \"share price\".\nThe aim for users was to identify rising stars, buying shares in them while still relatively cheap before selling at a profit after their values rose.\nFootball Index called itself a \"challenge to traditional bookmakers\" and an alternative to the regular stock market which it said could \"seem intimidating and inaccessible\".\nBut although it used the terminology of the stock market, Football Index was regulated by the Gambling Commission, not the Financial Conduct Authority.\nIn an update on Tuesday about the administration, BetIndex said it still hoped the company could \"be rescued as a going concern\". It added: \"Our priority is to safeguard the interests of our customers and to seek the best outcome for our community with the goal of continuing the platform in a restructured form.\"\nThe BBC has asked the Gambling Commission for comment. Last week the regulator said it was carrying out its own inquiries, pointing out it had concerns Football Index was not operating \"in accordance with a condition of its licence\"."

      "text": "The UK is set to reverse plans to reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by the middle of the decade, as part of a foreign policy overhaul. \nThe overall cap on the number of warheads will now increase to 260, having been due to drop to 180 under previous plans from 2010.\nThe UK will shift focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, described as the world's \"growth engine\".\nAnd it pledges the UK will do more on the \"systemic challenge\" of China.\nOutlining the strategy to MPs, Boris Johnson said the UK would have to \"relearn the art\" of competing against countries with \"opposing values\".\nBut he added the UK would remain \"unswervingly committed\" to the Nato defence alliance and preserving peace and security in Europe.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an \"era of retreat,\" with armed forces cuts \"every year for the last decade\".\nThe integrated review of foreign and defence policies, which runs to over 100 pages, has taken over a year and sets out UK priorities until 2030.\nThe UK nuclear stockpile is estimated to comprise 195 warheads, and had been due to fall to 180 by the mid-2020s under a 2010 defence review.\nBut the latest assessment says this ambition is \"no longer possible\" given the \"evolving security environment\" over the last decade. \nIt adds that the UK will no longer publish figures on the size of its operational stockpile, to maintain \"deliberate ambiguity\" for adversaries. \nHowever, it pledges the UK will maintain the \"minimum destructive power needed to guarantee that the UK's nuclear deterrent remains credible\".\nThe review, which identifies Russia as the \"most acute threat\" to UK security, also says:\nThe review also pledged to reverse cuts on foreign aid, from 0.7% of national income down to 0.5%, when \"the fiscal situation allows\".\nThe government has previously faced criticism for the cuts, which it said were necessary in the wake of financial challenges posed by the Covid pandemic.\nThe review argues the UK should refocus its foreign policy towards countries such as India, Japan and Australia in the \"Indo-Pacific\" region.\nIt said the region's shipping lanes were vital to maintain UK trade with Asia, whilst the region is also on the \"frontline of new security challenges\".\nAnalysis by Rob Watson, BBC World Service UK Political Correspondent\nWhat's striking about the review is the continuity in UK foreign policy.  \nSo just as before Brexit and \"Global Britain\", the UK continues to see the main threats to its security as China, Russia, terrorism and cyber attacks.  And it continues to have as its main goals, among other things, the promotion of democracy, free trade, human rights and the fight against climate change. \nThere are differences, though. The most striking is the suggestion of a pivot away from Europe to the Indo-Pacific.\nBut exactly what that means is not spelled out (although we do know Boris Johnson will travel to India next month, and there will be new focus on new partnerships and trade agreements with south-east Asian countries).\nMore broadly, Mr Johnson's central claim is that leaving the EU will make the UK more nimble and flexible, whether it's in how to deal with China or becoming a science superpower or anything else.  \nCritics will say the review is long on aspiration and that the UK will face the same global challenges it faced before Brexit - but with one fewer foreign policy tool in its toolbox, namely its membership of the EU.  \nMr Johnson said: \"The review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values.\"\nHe said the UK had led international condemnation of China's \"mass detention\" of Uighur people in Xinjiang, and its actions in Hong Kong, adding: \"There is no question China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours.\"\nIn response, Sir Keir said UK policy towards China had been \"inconsistent\" and the government had \"turned a blind eye\" to the country's human rights abuses.\nHe said Labour remained committed to retaining nuclear weapons, but said the document had failed to detail the \"strategic purpose\" for increasing the warhead stockpile.\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the review demonstrated \"just how hollow the brand of Global Britain is\".\nHe also asked the prime minister \"who gave his government the democratic right to renege on the UK's obligations under the nuclear proliferation treaty\" referring to the government's plans on nuclear weapons.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Beatrice Fihn - head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons -  described the UK's decision to change its nuclear provision as \"outrageous, irresponsible and very dangerous\".\nShe said it went against international law and didn't address the real security threats faced by Britain such as climate change and disinformation. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent \nThe review calls China the \"biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security\".\nBut there is clearly disquiet among the government's own MPs that it hasn't been robust enough in identifying the challenge posed by its Communist regime.  \nFormer Conservative foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was worried by its description of China as a \"systemic\" challenge, given its current clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong. \nAnother senior Conservative, Julian Lewis, took issue with its description of China as a \"partner\".\nHe added it suggested the \"grasping naivety\" of the party's approach under David Cameron and George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, \"still lingers on\".\nBoris Johnson said there was a \"balance to be struck\", and although the UK wanted a \"strong trading relationship,\" it should be \"clear-eyed\" and \"tough where we see risk\".\nBut the trade-offs between seeking investment and protecting the UK from becoming too vulnerable to Chinese economic and political influence and pressure will come under increasing scrutiny.

      "text": "St Patrick's Day \"must be different\" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues, First Minister Arlene Foster has warned.\nShe made the plea as she announced the first key changes to the restrictions.\nAll primary school pupils will return next Monday with all post-primary students set to return on 12 April.\nThere will also be changes to meeting up and some sports will be allowed to resume from 1 April.\nMrs Foster said decision-making capital was limited and needed to be \"spent wisely\".\n\"If we spend the capital on one easement of restrictions, it can't be spent on other things at the same time,\" she told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday.\nThe executive has regular review points every four weeks, with the next scheduled for 15 April.\nOutlining details of the executive's decisions, Mrs Foster said it was important restrictions were worked through in a \"careful and managed way\" at each review point.\n\"St Patrick's Day would normally be enjoyed by many. We need this to be different tomorrow,\" she said.\n\"Please continue to stay home. Do not socialise outside your family or your bubble, and we particularly want to say to young people that you need to follow the rules and the advice.\"\nShe said the decision to prioritise education was important for children to \"build and grow their friendship networks, to be able to socialise and grow their own interests and future potential\".\n\"The weather is improving and we have been in this current lockdown for around 80 days,\" added the first minister.\n\"That is a long time and a big ask, and we have been so grateful to everyone who has made a personal contribution to the improvement in the Covid situation.   \nMrs Foster acknowledged some people would be disappointed their sectors had not yet been given dates to reopen.\n\"We have focused on outdoor settings where the risk is relatively lower than indoor settings,\" she added.\nThe Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey also appealed for a quiet day. \nOn Tuesday she met representatives of Belfast City Council, local elected representatives, the PSNI, and Ulster and Queen's Universities, to discuss plans in place to prevent large gatherings in the Holylands area of Belfast.\n\"This year it is more important than ever that those who live in the Holylands and surrounding areas adhere to public health guidelines.  \n\"Breaches of those guidelines are completely unacceptable,\" she said.\nThe executive has also agreed to increase the provision for elite sports from March 25 March to allow a number of new competitions to begin.\nMrs Foster said the \"minor adjustment\" to the restrictions would allow two World Cup qualification matches scheduled for 25 and 31 March to take place as well as a friendly match between NI and the USA on 28 March. \nNo spectators will be permitted at any sporting event. \nStormont's health minister said it was vitally important that a \"free-for-all\" situation was avoided as restrictions eased.\nIn a paper for the Stormont Executive, Robin Swann said he continued to recommend a gradual approach.\nThere pandemic had resulted in \"increased harmful alcohol consumption, more snacking and increased sedentary behaviour\", he added.\nCommenting on the reopening of schools Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Children and Young People said she was \"pleased with a tinge of frustration\" about the move.\nKoulla Yiasouma told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that many primary school staff had been preparing for further remote learning, in the absence of clarity from the executive.\nDr Tom Black, chair of BMA Northern Ireland Council, said it was \"extremely important\" for children to return to school for their educational and social development as well as their mental health.\nHe said it was also very important that any easing of restrictions was done in a safe way.\nSport NI welcomed what it called \"the first cautious steps towards a return to outdoor sport\".\nUlster GAA said the organisation's Covid advisory group will issue updated guidance following news that groups of up to 15 people will be able to train together from 12 April.\nIt said clubs in Northern Ireland must stress to players and management teams that \"12 April is the earliest date that they may be permitted to resume activity\".\nReacting to the news about click and collect services Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was a \"much-needed lifeline to those struggling independent retailers\".\nThe chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, also called for indicative dates and clarity. \n\"At the very least, the data behind reopening decisions should be published,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, one death was reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 2,100.\nA further 164 cases of the virus were also confirmed.\nThere are 176 inpatients currently being treated for coronavirus in Northern Ireland, with 18 in intensive care.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Department of Health has reported 18 further Covid-related deaths and 349 new cases. Seventeen deaths occurred in March and one in February.\nIt brings the total number of deaths in the Republic of Ireland to 4,552 and the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases stands at 227,663.\nIn Northern Ireland, tough coronavirus restrictions were initially imposed on 26 December, in a bid to curb a rise in cases of Covid-19.\nThere have been some adjustments to the rules but households are generally still not allowed to mix indoors, pubs, cafes and restaurants remain closed except for takeaway, and most shops are shut.\nIn Northern Ireland, P1 to P3 pupils returned to the classroom last Monday, as did nursery and pre-school children.\nLast week, the executive ditched a previous plan for those pupils to go back to remote learning on 22 March when some secondary schoolchildren, year groups 12 to 14, are due to return to school.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir had been pushing for all remaining pupils to return as soon as possible and two weeks notice would have been preferable.\n\"My preference would have been that earlier decisions were taken,\" he said.\n\"That has to be weighed up against the wider public health situation and also a desire from the executive as a whole to try to take this in the context of a strategic decision in relation to that.\"\nMr Weir said it was important to get children back to school as soon as possible.\nVulnerable children and children of key workers have had access to schools for supervised learning since January, and special schools remained open as usual.\nSchools in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have all reopened on a wider basis."

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,UK defence spending,Boris Johnson,Ministry of Defence,Ben Wallace",
      "text": "A \"once-in-a-generation modernisation\" of the armed forces is required to extend British influence and protect the public, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe prime minister told MPs a new four-year funding deal would protect \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs and create 40,000 new roles.\n\"I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,\" he said.\nLabour welcomed more defence spending but asked how it would be funded.\nOutlining the new package in the Commons, the PM - speaking over video link as he is self-isolating - said the benefits \"will go far beyond our armed forces\".\nMr Johnson described the increase in defence spending as being worth \u00a316.5bn in new money over four years.\nHowever economist Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said that while this represented a big rise in spending, the figure of \u00a316.5bn was a \"misleading way to present this announcement\".\nHe continued: \"It would be more accurate to say that by 2024-25, defence spending will be \u00a37bn higher than it would have been under previous plans.\"\nMr Johnson said: \"Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe.\"\nThe PM pledged to end defence budget cuts, protect shipping lanes that supply the country, press on with renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent and restore Britain as \"the foremost naval power in Europe\" with a \"renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK\".\nHe also said the funding would allow investment in new technology such as:\n\"From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year - 40,000 in total - levelling-up across our country and reinforcing our union,\" Mr Johnson added. \nThis is a big win for Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who's been fighting hard for a significant increase in defence spending and a long-term financial settlement to end what he calls a cycle of overambitious, under-funded defence reviews of the past.  \nThe Treasury had been arguing for a much smaller annual increase. But Mr Wallace found an ally in the PM, who says his first priority is defence of the realm. \nBoris Johnson also believes it'll boost Britain's place in the world and create jobs.  \nThe extra money will be used to modernise the armed forces with more spent on robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber. \nDespite the palpable relief inside the MoD it still has to fill a \u00a313bn black hole in its equipment budget. Difficult decisions about cutting old equipment to fund the new are still to be made. \nThe MoD, which doesn't have a strong track record of balancing its books, now has to prove it can spend wisely. \nAnd good news for defence might also mean bad news for other government departments - there's already speculation the international aid budget could be cut.   \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of making a \"spending announcement without a strategy\" and asked whether the money would be raised through cuts or tax rises, or both.\nMr Johnson did not respond to the question but said Sir Keir's record of support for the armed forces was \"very thin indeed\".\nFormer foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Mr Johnson \"not to listen to any voices in his ear\" saying that cutting international aid could help to fund the increase in defence spending.\nAnd Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the international development committee, asked Mr Johnson to \"quash rumours and confirm his manifesto commitment\" of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, \"now and going forwards\".\nThe PM responded by telling the Commons: \"I think we can all be proud of our record on overseas aid and that will continue.\"\nGen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said he was \"absolutely delighted\" by the announcement.\n\"But of course we're also conscious that living through this Covid crisis, the armed forces have stepped up to the plate to provide some of the resilience that the nation has needed,\" he added.\nEarlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said \"letting go\" of some older weapons would create \"headroom\" for new investment.\nHe added: \"When I looked across at the armed forces today I saw them with equipment that was out-of-date, I saw our adversaries across the world having better equipment, the ability to attack us and harm us getting wider and wider from our capabilities.\"\nThe funding announcement is part of the first conclusions of the government's Integrated Review which looks at security, defence, development and foreign policy.\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the extra money would give \"a welcome and long-overdue upgrade to Britain's defences after a decade of decline\".\nConservative MP and defence select committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said: \"This is a lot of money but ultimately there are still huge financial pressures facing our armed forces.\"\nBut he said the \"key takeaway\" for him was the \"message this sends to the British people, to the MoD as well, that we want to be back as a strong power capability\"."

      "text": "Conservative MP David Davis has used parliamentary privilege to criticise the Scottish government's handling of allegations against Alex Salmond. \nThe former minister told MPs during a Commons debate that there had been a \"concerted effort\" by SNP officials to encourage complainers to come forward.\nMr Davis also suggested Scottish government officials knew earlier than previously acknowledged of the claims. \nA spokesman for Nicola Sturgeon has dismissed the allegations.  \nMr Davis accused the Scottish government of ignoring its own procedures and \"actively withholding information\" from the Holyrood inquiry which has been tasked with looking at the issue. \nDuring the debate he also said: \"I have it on good authority that there exists from 6th Feb 2018 an exchange of messages between civil servants suggesting that the first minister's chief of staff is interfering in the complaints process against Alex Salmond.\n\"If true this suggests the chief of staff had knowledge of the case in February, not April as she has claimed.\"\nMr Davis said he had been passed messages from the telephone of a senior SNP official by a whistleblower.\nHe read some of the messages out in the Commons and said they \"show that there is a concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" after the criminal investigation into Mr Salmond had started. \nThe intervention from Mr Davis came on the day a leading QC asked to examine the government's procedures  - after it conceded its handling of complaints against Alex Salmond was \"unlawful\" - published her findings.\nLaura Dunlop made a range of recommendations about how complaints against serving ministers could be investigated but said probes concerning former ministers should be independent.\nMs Dunlop's report came ahead of two other keenly anticipated reports relating to the bungled civil action against Mr Salmond. \nA Holyrood inquiry into what went wrong and an independent investigation of whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code in her contact with her predecessor are both due to report back in the coming weeks. \nA spokesman for First Minister Ms Sturgeon said: \"As with Mr Salmond's previous claims and cherry picking of messages, the reality is very different to the picture being presented.\n\"Every message involving SNP staff has been seen by the committee previously. Their views have been widely reported as dismissive of them.\"\nOn Wednesday, the Holyrood inquiry committee published a further submission from a former government staffer, Lorraine Kay, supporting Mr Salmond's claims.\nThe former first minister has said he was passed the name of one of the complainers during the investigation, while meetings between himself and Ms Sturgeon were being arranged.\nMs Sturgeon has said she does not accept that this happened, but Ms Kay told MSPs that she was also told the name by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein.\nTwo other allies of the former first minster - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have also backed this account, which opposition MSPs say would be an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\".\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she believed Mr Salmond was already aware of who the complainers were, and that what was said to Mr Aberdein was \"a matter of contention\"."

She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. \nPrincess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Timothy Laurence. \nThe princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. \nBorn: 1977\nPeter Phillips is the eldest of the Queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. \nThe children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles.\nPeter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020.\nBorn: 2010\nSavannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips and the Queen's first great-grandchild. \nBorn: 2012\nIsla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips. \nBorn: 1981\nZara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics.

      "title": "Football Index collapse: 'I lost \u00a34,000 in seven days'",
      "tags": "Companies,Gambling",
      "text": "It's been sleepless nights and cold sweats for customers of Football Index, the gambling company whose collapse into administration has left people facing huge losses.\n\"I feel embarrassed and cheated,\" Ben told the BBC. He's not alone. Social media and online chat threads are alight with anger and dismay at the rapid demise of one of the UK's fastest growing betting firms.\nIn the couple of weeks before Football Index called in administrators to run the business, Ben, aged 22, lost more than \u00a34,000 in seven days, \u00a31,400 of which disappeared in 24 hours. It's now possible he will lose all his \u00a36,500 deposit in the firm.\n\"I'm employed, I live at home, and I've not got many overheads. I'm only responsible for myself right now, but there are people out there with families who have been hit a lot worse.\"\nLike other people who spoke to the BBC - young, male and red-faced at losing so much money - Ben did not want to disclose his surname.\n\"The crash has affected me mentally,\" he said. \"Everyone affected by this wants to say how disappointed they are with the leadership of Football Index.\"\nThe Jersey-based company styled itself as a \"stock market of football\". Gamblers, which it called punters, bought and sold \"shares\" in professional footballers, earning dividend payments depending on the players' performance and rising - or falling - value.\nLaunched in 2015, it soon became a fixture of the sports betting sector and was a sponsor of Queens Park Rangers and Nottingham Forest football teams, which have removed branding.\nNow, Football Index risks becoming the biggest failure in UK gambling history. Reports suggest punters stand to lose up to \u00a3100m. Law firm Leigh Day is investigating whether there are grounds to take legal action against the platform on behalf of affected punters. \nJack, 24, told the BBC: \"I have always been really into football. But I was never interested in traditional football betting. Football Index had a stock market element, which attracted me. It combined my interest in analysing the game.\"\nHe has already lost \u00a35,000, and fears his remaining \u00a32,500 locked up in the business will go. \"I earn a modest public sector wage, so \u00a37,500 goes a long way.\"\nHe says that, with hindsight, there were signs Football Index had been \"going downhill for a while\". But things turned really sour on 5 March.\nThe company cut dividend payouts on players, sparking a crash in their \"share\" value. There's also concern that Football Index had recently issued \"shares\" in new players, which encouraged people to \"invest\".\nWhat angers customers is that these were corporate policy changes, and nothing to do with footballers' performances. \"We all knew that if a footballer broke a leg or moved to China, that would affect the value,\" he said. \"This was different.\"\nAnother Football Index customer put it this way: \"If I'd put \u00a31,000 on the 3.15 at Ascot and it came last, that's my fault. I'll take the hit.\" But Football Index \"moved the goalposts in the middle of the game\", he believes.\n\"\u00a320,000 is a lot of money to lose. I have been putting money into Football Index since 2016, when I was 18. A year ago my portfolio was 100% up. \n\"The drop in value of my portfolio sets me back a lot. Most of it was savings. I've seen Football Index as my savings account. \n\"I will have to think about what to do without that substantial money and I have made cutbacks in my personal life. I've moved out of London and back into the family home. I used to be quite free with my spending but now I tell myself that I can't spend anything. \n\"I would have wanted to buy property with the money - put it down as a deposit.\n\"Mentally, football doesn't give me the same enjoyment. I put a lot of energy into my portfolio. After five years of putting energy into it, it's all been sucked out.\" \nJack says it was almost a relief when management called in administrators to try to salvage something from the business. \n\"For days (before the collapse) I'd been struggling with what to do - pull out what money was left, hang on for an upturn,\" he said. \"There's been talk of legal action. I've considered that. Now the decisions have been taken out of my hands. It's lifted a worry.\"\nSome critics argue Football Index was akin to a Ponzi scheme. \"To pay out dividends, it required more customers to deposit money. When that dried up, the problems started\", said Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling and a former gambling addict.\n\"Football Index is an unsustainable business model. They created a stock market out of assets they themselves created. The football players on the market had no underlying value,\" he said.\nJack thinks the Ponzi comparison is unfair. Gamblers knew what they were getting into - they just didn't expect Football Index to suddenly change its terms, he said.\n\"The concept is still brilliant. It was fun. If there was a change of management I'd be willing to give them a second chance - but I'll definitely reduce my (financial) stake,\" he said.\nJack, and Mr Zarb-Cousin, agree on one thing, though: the Gambling Commission (GC) has a lot of questions to answer. \n\"Football Index should never have been given a licence. Did the Gambling Commission really understand what they were approving? They should certainly have acted earlier,\" Mr Zarb-Cousin said. \nJames Grimes, an ex-gambler and founder of the The Big Step campaign group, said: \"It comes as little surprise to many of us harmed by gambling that another company has failed to protect its customers from immeasurable harm. \n\"The immediate financial impact on the people caught up in this failure is devastating, but the damage to mental health and affected others is too much to contemplate, especially when gambling-related harm incurs such a high suicide risk.\"\nThe GC declined to comment, instead referring the BBC to its statement last week and suspension of the company's gambling licence after Football Index called in administrators. This statement said the GC had concerns Football Index was not operating \"in accordance with a condition of its licence\".\nFootball Index also declined to comment. In a statement last week, the company's parent, BetIndex, said its \"goal\" was for Football Index to re-open for trading once a restructuring was completed.  It also said remaining cash balances were being held in a \"segregated account\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland continues to edge closer to the lifting of lockdown.\nThe how and when is a decision for the executive but what do the statistics associated with the pandemic tell us?\nFor weeks now, things have been going - if not well - a lot better than they were when we entered 2021.\nInfection rates are down, there are fewer people in hospital, and while there have been days when the number of deaths has risen, the death rate remains relatively low.\nAdded to that is the ongoing rollout of the vaccination programme - this has been going well and is expected to step up to another level in the next few weeks with opening of the mass vaccination centre at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\nThe infection rate in Northern Ireland has fallen to about 64 cases per 100,000 of the population.\nWales has the lowest infection rate in the UK.\nEngland, Scotland and Northern Ireland are all very similar - although, while Scotland and England's have fallen in recent days, Northern Ireland's infection rate has actually risen slightly.\nHowever, the rates remain relatively low.\nThe Republic of Ireland has a slightly higher infection rate at the moment and has risen marginally over the past few days.\nHere are the seven-day infection rates for the UK and Ireland up until March 12:\nOver the past few weeks, increasing numbers of people have been getting tested in Northern Ireland - more than 30,000 a week now - and over the same period of time, we've seen a drop in the number of positive cases.\nIn the past week, about one in every 25 people tested have received a positive result for Covid-19; compare that with the start of January, when more than one in four people were getting a positive result.\nOr here's another way of looking at this - on average fewer than 200 people are testing positive for the virus in Northern Ireland each day. \nThat is a massive change from our peak in January when there was an average of more than 1,800 positive results per day.\nGiven that we're now testing roughly the same number of people each day as we were back in mid-January, the comparison is fairly straightforward.\nDespite the overall low infection rate for Northern Ireland, there are places where the rates are higher.\nFor example, based on Department of Health data, Mid Ulster has still the highest infection rate of all the council areas in Northern Ireland, and it's risen slightly over the past week.\nIt's not alone in seeing rising infection rates. \nAntrim and Newtownabbey; Belfast; Causeway Coast and Glens; Lisburn and Castlereagh; and Newry, Mourne and Down have all seen small increases in their infection rates.\nHowever, the department indicates that the Ards and North Down Borough Council area has seen a substantial rise in its rate of virus spread - by about 50%.\nIts infection rate is now above 80 cases per 100,000 population, making it the third worst in Northern Ireland (Belfast is in second spot).\nMore localised analysis suggests higher infection rates in areas around Strabane, Dundonald, Holywood and parts of south Belfast.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, certain border areas have seen a decrease in infections - most notably Cavan and Leitrim. \nDonegal, Monaghan and Louth have all seen falling rates, although Louth still has one of the higher infection rates in the Republic.\nThe number of people in Northern Ireland's hospitals with Covid-19 is now below 200. The last time the figure was this low was in early October.\nThe daily admissions have been similarly falling. \nThe current seven-day rolling average for daily hospital admissions in Northern Ireland is 10. \nFor context, at the peak in January, we could expect nearly 100 Covid-positive patients to be admitted into hospital each day.\nThese low admission numbers, along with lower infection rates indicate that the numbers of inpatients with Covid should continue to fall, at least in the short term.\nBear in mind that these numbers could start to rise, especially if localised increases in infection rates become more widespread.\nStill, our hospitals remain under quite a bit of pressure, with occupancy at 95%. The yearly average hospital occupancy in Northern Ireland has consistently been about 84% for a number of years.\nNorthern Ireland currently has fewer than 30 patients with Covid in intensive care units (ICU) - at 23, it's the lowest number for this measure in five months.\nThe number of ICU patients is important, as it gives some idea of how many people with the virus are very seriously ill.\nA recent report by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) reveals some details of the type of patients that have been in ICU in Northern Ireland over the course of the pandemic.\nThe report looks at data from the start of the pandemic until 31 August and then from 1 September to 4 March.\nIt shows that about 70% of ICU patients with Covid have been men. The vast majority of ICU patients with the virus have been classed as overweight.\nThe age profile of ICU patients with Covid has been around 60 on average.\nAnd the figures in the report indicate that the poorest people in society have been more likely to end up in ICU suffering from Covid-19.\nThis is consistent with many other trends in health statistics which show that the most deprived are frequently the most adversely affected.\nNorthern Ireland's death rate has increased slightly since the start of March. \nBy the beginning of the month, the seven-day rolling average death rate had dipped to two - equivalent to the start of October, before the winter surge started in earnest.\nOver the past week it has been sitting at four.\nThe general downward trend in the death rate has been reflected for six weeks in a row by the figures published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra).\nBased on the deaths counted by health departments across the UK (deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 result) Northern Ireland has had the fewest deaths by population since the start of the pandemic:\nThe Republic of Ireland records deaths slightly differently than the health authorities in the UK - probable and possible deaths are included in Ireland, which makes it much more akin to the weekly number recorded by Nisra. \nHowever, based on the number published by the Irish government, 90 people have died for every 100,000 in the state - less than half the rate of the United Kingdom.\nThis indicates that Ireland has had a lower death rate than the UK, but Northern Ireland's is closer to the Republic of Ireland's than to Britain's.\nAnother way of looking at deaths is to examine the number of fatalities in comparison to the number of people who test positive for the virus.\nThis measure reinforces the picture of the island of Ireland having had a different death rate than Britain:\nThe UK's rolling average death rate has now fallen below countries such as France and the United States. \nHowever, the UK still has one of the world's worst recorded cumulative death rates for the whole pandemic.\nMore than 600,000 people in Northern Ireland have now received a vaccine - and that number continues to climb. \nMeasured by sheer volume, the vaccination programme continues to be a success.\nAbout one in three people in Northern Ireland have had a Covid vaccine jab.\nThis is slightly less than the comparative percentages for the rest of the UK, but is still very impressive in the space of three months.\nIn terms of Northern Ireland's adult population, almost 43% has received a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe Republic of Ireland's vaccination is still some way behind Northern Ireland's.\nAbout 8% of the population in the Republic of Ireland has been vaccinated.\nIt's worth noting that Ireland has adopted a different strategy to the UK, and has not concentrated so much on first doses.\nMore than a third of those vaccinated in the Republic have already received their second dose.\nIn Northern Ireland, the numbers of people receiving their second dose each day have not been predictable, but it looks like the numbers are starting to increase, albeit from quite a low base.\nSo far, almost 50,000 people in Northern Ireland have had their second dose of vaccine.\nThis week, the Department of Health launched a new dashboard specifically to record the progress of the vaccination programme.\nAt the minute, it mostly brings together data that was available from a variety of other platforms, but there are plans to improve it, according to Health Minister Robin Swann.\n\"It is the first step in plans to publish detailed daily data on vaccinations and a more comprehensive dashboard is currently in preparation,\" he said.\n\"I am committed to improving the regular flow of information on the programmes because this will help us to chart our progress as the programme advances through the various age groups.\"\nIt's worth noting that almost half the vaccines given out in Northern Ireland have been administered by GPs.\nThe main bits of new data on the dashboard are the numbers of healthcare workers who have received a vaccine - about 125,000.\nAt the time the dashboard was launched, healthcare workers and care home workers accounted for about one in four of the first dose vaccines administered in Northern Ireland.\nThe new dashboard does not give any data on uptake rates, however - that is, the number of people who were offered a vaccine; numbers of those who took it; and numbers of those who didn't.\nThis data, once available, will give decision makers the ability to try to target particular areas or groups in attempts to improve the uptake of vaccines."

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Priti Patel",
      "text": "Hundreds of people joined a new vigil for Sarah Everard on Monday, despite the home secretary warning against such gatherings.\nPriti Patel said she understood public anger over the 33-year-old's killing but urged people not to protest while Covid restrictions were in place.\nMs Patel also said she had started a review into the policing of a previous London event for Ms Everard.\nOfficers handcuffed and removed several women from Saturday's vigil in Clapham.\nSpeaking from Monday's event in Parliament Square, Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, said there were \"far fewer\" police than there had been at Saturday's vigil, adding that officers had taken a \"hands-off\" approach similar to that seen during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. \nThe Met faced widespread criticism for its handling of the Clapham vigil but the force's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has rejected a call to step down.\nFour people were arrested for public order and Covid offences on Saturday, after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\nHer body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the marketing executive's kidnap and murder.\nOn Monday evening, police began to move in on protesters in central London, after urging crowds to \"leave immediately\" or face \"enforcement activity\". \nCampaigners had marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area chanting and waving banners.\nProtesters could be heard urging others to run and \"keep moving\", with traffic in the surrounding areas brought to a stop.\nA large police presence followed the demonstrators, along with police vans and motorbikes.\nProtests and vigils have also been held in several other UK cities over the past few days, including Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Brighton, and Liverpool.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said: \"Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge why Sarah's death has upset so many. \n\"My heartache, and that of others, can be summed up in just five words: 'She was just walking home.'\"\nThe home secretary also confirmed she had instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to review the policing of Saturday's vigil.\nShe said Ms Everard's killing had \"rightly ignited anger at the danger posed to women by predatory men and anger I feel as strongly as anyone\".\nHowever, she urged people not to participate in large gatherings or protests, saying that while the right to protest was a \"cornerstone of our democracy\", the government's duty was still to prevent more lives being lost during the pandemic.\nShe stressed that the government had put in place measures to ensure women and girls felt safe, including tackling domestic abuse, female genital mutilation and upskirting.\nThe Domestic Abuse bill is on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, she said, adding that it would \"transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime\".\nIn response, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: \"Let me be clear, it is not women who should change their behaviour, it is men and wider society that needs to change.\n\"And at times like this it is vital people are able to have their voices heard, of course in a way that is lawful and Covid-secure. Yet this weekend in Clapham things clearly went very wrong and I share the anger about the policing and the scenes we saw.\"\nHe also accused the government of \"a chronic failure\" to address violence against women and girls, adding that \"meetings and reopening surveys are not enough\".\nPolice took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening.\nAfter that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End.\nAt first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations.\nAnd so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets.\nEventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. \nSome left, some appeared to get tickets.\nThey wanted to make their voices heard against these proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations. \nBut the way they acted tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted.\nFollowing a meeting of the government's Criminal Justice taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take \"immediate steps\" to give \"further reassurance\" to women and girls in the wake of Ms Everard's death.\nNo 10 said it would be doubling the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to \u00a345m.\nPilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - with uniformed and undercover officers working to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in \"landmark legislation\" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets.\nHe said: \"Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them.\"\nLabour's Mr Thomas-Symonds said replacing \"a tiny fraction of the cuts [the Conservatives] have made to local services is nowhere near good enough\".\nA spokeswoman for Reclaim These Streets, the group that initially organised the vigil, said they welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were \"so important\".\n\"Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,\" she said.\nOn Monday, Reclaim These Streets said it had lost confidence in Dame Cressida after talks with her earlier, claiming that she left after 15 minutes.\nAnna Birley of the group told BBC News: \"To be honest, Cressida Dick has lost our confidence and the confidence of women in the capital. We didn't want to call on her to resign until we'd at least had a meeting and given her a chance to engage.\n\"We don't have great confidence in the Met Police's willingness to work with us, unless forced to.\"\nReclaim These Streets called off Saturday's vigil, saying police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nWhen people gathered anyway, the group pointed out that they did so without the marshalling and other safety measures that had been originally proposed.\nOn Sunday, there were protests outside the Met Police's headquarters at New Scotland Yard, Downing Street and in Parliament Square."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Scotland's chief medical officer has said he is \"wholly confident\" in the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\nA number of European countries have suspended use of the vaccine amid fears that it may cause blood clots.\nHowever, watchdogs including the World Health Organisation have found no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\nDr Gregor Smith said he would \"categorically state that we remain confident\" in the vaccine programme.\nAnd First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to continue to come forward for appointments when invited, saying they provide \"significant protection\" against the virus.\nThe Republic of Ireland has joined countries including the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway in pausing their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThere have been about 30 cases in Europe of \"thromboembolic events\" - people developing blood clots - after the vaccine was administered.\nHowever, with almost five million people having been given a first dose of the vaccine across Europe, AstraZeneca said this number of clots was \"significantly lower... than would be expected among the general population\".\nBoth the WHO and the European Medicines Agency have said there is no indication that the jab was causing the blood clots.\nThe use of vaccines in the UK is governed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which has backed the continued use of the AstraZeneca jab.\nAt the Scottish government's daily Covid-19 briefing, Dr Smith said there had been \"no causal link between any of these incidents and the AstraZeneca vaccine\".\nHe said: \"What we can say at this point in time is that looking at the data about blood clots both in Europe and the UK, it is no more common to have an episode of a blood clot than you would see in the general population - in fact it is somewhat less.\n\"Between one and two people in a thousand would suffer a blood clot in any given year. Among the 17 million or so vaccinations given with the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, we have not seen any signal coming through whatsoever to suggest there are any more blood clots than expected in that population.\n\"People in that population are going to continue to become ill anyway - they will have events that they would have had whether they had had the vaccine or not.\n\"What we are looking for in this data, what the MHRA will be looking for, is any signs of those events being over or above what is expected - and they are not seeing that.\"\nMs Sturgeon said she would be happy to be given the AstraZeneca jab, and urged others to continue to come forward.\nThe first minister said she was in the age group that should be given a first dose of the vaccine by mid-April, saying she was \"hoping to see my blue envelope appear at some point in the next couple of weeks\".\nShe added: \"As soon as I get that, I will be there without hesitation, regardless of which of the vaccines I am being offered. And I would urge everybody getting an invitation to be vaccinated to be vaccinated, because it provides you and people you live with significant protection.\"\nMs Sturgeon said \"virtually all\" Scots over the age of 65 had now had a first dose of vaccine, as had 53% of 60-64 year olds, 41% of 55-59 year olds and 33% of those aged 50 to 54.\nShe said the pace of vaccination should \"pick up significantly\" in the coming days, with supplies expected to be available for 400,000 doses to be administered over the course of the week.\nThis is projected to continue into next month, with the government \"on track\" to hit its target of completing all priority groups - including over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with underlying health conditions - by mid-April.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"That will be a really significant milestone, if and when we meet that target. It provides all of us with firmer grounds for hope for the months and weeks ahead.\"\nThe first minister will set out plans for further easing of lockdown restrictions at Holyrood on Tuesday, with moves to re-open shops and hospitality venues and lift the \"stay at home\" order expected to be scheduled through April and into May.\nIn his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference, leader Douglas Ross challenged Ms Sturgeon to \"stop putting Scotland's future on hold\" and \"publish the full plan that we're all waiting for\".\nHe said: \"The Scottish people expect to be treated as adults, and honestly told - here's what to expect. They know that dates aren't chiselled in stone - but they deserve more clarity.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for a \"balanced\" approach, saying: \"We have to make sure this is the last lockdown.\"\nHe added: \"Let's not just think the silver bullet is the vaccine - it is one part of trying to drive down the virus, but if we are going to truly have an elimination strategy we have got to suppress the virus to next to zero levels and isolate it at those small levels.\n\"In order to do that we've got to up the level of testing, and then alongside that we need to isolate the virus using our tracing system in a more effective way.\""

      "text": "The EU's medicines regulator has said it remains \"firmly convinced\" that the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab outweigh the risks.\nIt reiterated that there was \"no indication\" the vaccine causes blood clots, after several leading EU states paused their rollouts. \nEuropean Medicines Agency (EMA) head Emer Cooke said the body stood by its decision to approve the vaccine.\nAn investigation into cases of clots in a handful of recipients is ongoing.\nThe World Health Organization has urged countries not to halt vaccinations.\nVaccine safety experts from the WHO are also meeting on Tuesday to review the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. \nThe EMA says the number of blood clots reported in vaccinated people is no higher than that seen in the general population.\n\"We know that many thousands of people develop blood clots in the EU so what we want is to establish whether these events are caused by the vaccine or by other causes,\" Ms Cooke said. \n\"While the investigation is ongoing, currently, we are still firmly convinced that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing Covid-19, with its associated risks of hospitalisation and death, outweigh the risks,\" she added. \nResults from the EMA's investigation are due to be released on Thursday. \nA number of countries have suspended use of the vaccine, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\nThey said they were pausing the rollout following reports of blood clots in some recipients. Blood clots are solid clumps that form in the blood, which can be life threatening if not treated quickly. The countries stressed it was a precautionary measure. \n\"This is a professional decision,\" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said, adding that he was following the recommendation of the country's vaccine institute.\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz said Germany hoped the vaccine could be used again, and expected the EMA to decide swiftly on how to proceed. \nSeveral medical experts and politicians in Germany, where infections are rising rapidly, have argued that the vaccine should be used until proven unsafe. \nA Free Democrat spokeswoman said the decision had set back the entire vaccination rollout. Greens health expert Janosch Dahmen argued that authorities could have provided detailed information about \"manageable risk\" and continued using the drug. \nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the drug, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nA rise in cases has led many countries to tighten restrictions and there are concerns over the pace of Europe's vaccination drive, which has already been affected by shortages. \nIn Italy, the director general of the medicines authority called the decision to suspend the vaccine \"political\".\nNicola Magrini told Italian daily newspaper la Repubblica that the vaccine was safe and that the benefit to risk ratio of the jab was \"widely positive\".\nIt is understandable anyone going to get vaccinated would be concerned given these reports.\nBut the regulators in the UK and Europe are clear that vaccination should continue even though some individual nations have taken a different approach.\nWhy? It's all to do with risk.\nFrom what has been published so far the chance of a blood clot after vaccination is very low and at this stage looks like it could be in line with what you would expect to happen anyway - coincidence rather than cause.\nIn comparison, the risk from Covid to those currently being offered the vaccine is significant.\nMost of continental Europe is still working its way through the over-70s. \nIf they are infected and have symptoms they have around a one in four chance of becoming seriously ill and needing hospital care.\nIn the UK those in their 50s are being invited. They have a one in 10 chance.\nWhat is more, one of the most common consequences of serious Covid illness is blood clots.\nWhen it comes to risk, the odds are clearly in favour of vaccination.\nThe UN's health body said it was meeting on Tuesday to \"review the reports of rare blood coagulation disorders\" in people who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nOn Monday, a spokesman said there was \"no evidence\" that the incidents were linked to the vaccine.\n\"As soon as WHO has gained a full understanding of these events, the findings and any unlikely changes to current recommendations will be immediately communicated to the public,\" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said.\nThe UK medicines regulator said evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots, as it urged people in the country to get the vaccine when asked to do so. \nThe company says there is no evidence of an increased risk of clotting due to the vaccine. \nIt said that across the EU and the United Kingdom there had been 15 events of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) - a blood clot in a vein - and 22 events of pulmonary embolism - a blood clot that has entered the lungs - reported among those vaccinated.\nThese figures were \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines\".  \nProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group which developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, told the BBC on Monday that there was \"very reassuring evidence that there is no increase in a blood clot phenomenon here in the UK, where most of the doses in Europe [have] been given so far\".\nFinland has also done a \"very careful study\" and not found an increased risk, he added.\nHe said it was \"absolutely critical that we don't have a problem of not vaccinating people\"."

      "text": "The mother of a woman who was abducted and murdered in Glasgow has expressed her concern for Sarah Everard's family.\nBea Jones said she had been left \"distressed\" by the similarities between the case and what happened to her own daughter, Moira, in 2008.\nAnd she has urged the public to keep Sarah's loved ones in mind.\nBea wrote: \"We send love to them all and wish them all the strength they need to get through all the dark days ahead.\"\nMoira Jones was randomly abducted yards from her home and forced into nearby Queen's Park, where she was raped and beaten to death.\nSlovakian national Marek Harcar was jailed in 2009 for the murder and the judge set the punishment part of his life sentence at 25 years.\nLord Bracadale said the crime had \"shocked the nation\" and told Harcar: \"Your conduct that night reflects a level of wickedness very rarely encountered.\"\nIn a bid to cope with her loss, former teacher Bea wrote a harrowing diary, which last year featured in BBC Scotland documentary The Dark Shadow of Murder.\nShe also set up a charity, The Moira Fund, to help bereaved families.\nBea, from Weston, Staffordshire, decided to write a letter outlining her fears about the Sarah Everard case after receiving multiple media approaches for comment.  \nMs Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in Kent woodland.\nBea wrote: \"We have been very distressed by what has happened to Sarah, similar in many respects, to Moira's ordeal. \n\"I really could not face talking about this and thought that perhaps one open letter would suffice.\"\nShe said her main concern was for Sarah's family and loved ones.\nShe wrote: \"They are totally devastated and bewildered and vulnerable. They cannot fully take in what has happened and the permanence of what has occurred.\n\"They have experienced nightmare on top of nightmare as events have unravelled and their beautiful missing daughter became another murder victim. And there seems no end to it.\"\nBea says she can understand the reaction and response from women nationwide to the shocking crime and believes Sarah's family may have been comforted by the thought that \"so many were grieving with them\".\nBut she continues: \"Now it has all escalated into a media frenzy more representative of individual anger than of shared grief. \n\"I am very concerned that events have developed to such an extent that those who matter most, Sarah and her family, are being totally swamped and further traumatised by what is going on around them, adding trauma to trauma. \n\"How can they cope at all? There is only so much that a head can absorb and a heart can cope with and they have so much more to find out in the weeks and months ahead as dreadful details of Sarah's death are revealed to them.\"\nBea says the family need to be protected from media intrusion and then turns her thoughts towards Sarah's mother, whom she says will have a head full of questions about what happened to her daughter and what she went through.\nDrawing on her own experiences, she lists several, including: \"Did she know how very much we loved her?\"\nBea continues: \"There are no answers to these questions, there never will be, but she will keep on asking them, over and over torturing herself. I ask them still - not so often but after 13 years I ask them still. \n\"Sarah's mum needs time and space to ask them too, to run all sorts through her head before an avalanche of other information descends.\n\"Her family have lived with the joy of Sarah for 33 years and the loss of that joy will affect them for the rest of their lives. It will be a long time before they can even get past the trauma, to start processing the awfulness of it all and being able to grieve. There really are no words to describe that awfulness.\"\nAs part of the nationwide events, ribbons and messages have been tied to the gates of Queen's Park including many which mention Moira, 40, by name.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to the sales executive on social media at the weekend and said she thought of Moira every time she walked through the park in the south side of the city.\nBea said she had been moved by the fresh messages of support for her \"darling girl\", who moved from London to Glasgow in 2003.\nThe campaigner has previously described how she cannot bear to say the name of the man who killed Moira.\nBea also called on the media to focus on Sarah Everard as opposed to Met police officer Wayne Couzens, who is accused of murdering and kidnapping the marketing executive.\nShe concludes her letter by pledging to continue to support those who have been bereaved by violence and urges the public never to forgot the pain they go through.\nShe wrote: \"We frequently read and hear of murder cases in the news but it is rare indeed for us to read of the plight of those left behind, whose lives that are changed forever by the violent death of a loved one.\""

We have the chance to do the same again now for children,\" says the children's commissioner.\nDame Rachel, who ran schools in Norfolk and Suffolk, wants a 10-year plan to emerge from her review - with the promise of tackling a political system which can \"often short-change children\".\nFor more immediate challenges, on whether free school meals should run across the summer holidays, she told the BBC: \"I absolutely want to see free school meals extended.\n\"And I'm very concerned about suggestions of dropping Universal Credit. If it was dropped down again, I'd like to see services provided in its place, but I'd rather it wasn't dropped.\"\nA former teacher, head teacher and chief executive of a school academy trust, Dame Rachel promised to be an \"independent voice, there to fight to protect and promote the rights of children\".\nIf government was \"doing something wrong\", she said, \"I will be fearless in exposing that and challenging them\". \nThe review will consider how children will recover from so much disrupted education - calculating that collectively pupils in England have lost 840 million days of in-person schooling since the start of the pandemic, representing about 19 weeks each.\nIt will address the \"social fault lines\" and inequalities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, between generations, the wealthy and the disadvantaged, by ethnicity and geography.\nThis includes how the gulf between rich and poor and young and old has widened, with older, higher earners increasing their savings in the lockdown, while poorer families and younger people have faced job losses and increasingly fragile finances.\nToday's young people are the first post-war generation to be less well-off than their parents, says the report launching the children's commissioner's review.\n\"As we emerge from the Covid pandemic, this is the moment for something big, for children to recognise the sacrifices they have made,\" said Dame Rachel.\n\"I have seen first-hand the effect of this crisis on young people's hopes and dreams, and sometimes our answers simply have not been good enough.\"\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: \"Over the last decade the Conservatives have overseen record numbers of children being pushed into poverty, a worsening mental health crisis and an 18-month gap in learning between disadvantaged children and their peers at GCSE.\"\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We know that children and families have faced unprecedented challenges during the pandemic. \n\"We've expanded frontline charity support and provided new resources for schools and teachers to support children and young people's mental health.\n\"Our \u00a31.7bn investment in recovery support will help tackle the impact of any lost learning and we are investing an additional \u00a379m to increase the number of mental health support teams working with schools and colleges.\""

That's why urgent action is required by the government.\"\nOne Cancer Voice estimates that millions of people have had their cancer care affected in some way by the pandemic. Newsbeat's spent the last three months speaking to some of those.\nGeorge Hatfield, 20, was told by doctors he's one of the youngest patients ever diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. \nHaving been on different treatments of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, George, from Hampshire, was considered for surgery because of the \"good response\" he was showing.\nBut he says in the pandemic, that all changed, with doctors hesitant to press ahead.\n\"They didn't want to put me at an even higher risk of catching Covid and getting seriously ill. I was already immunosuppressed by my drugs.\"\nGeorge admits thinking about how things might have been different without a pandemic, which has effectively taken away a treatment option.\n\"When having lots of options is your positive thing and suddenly one gets taken away, it's quite worrying,\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nGeorge says his future is very much a case of taking \"every day as it comes\" and not looking too far ahead.\n\"I look a bit further now. When I first started, I didn't look past three weeks but now I look at what plans I've got for the end of the year.\"\nHe feels his experience has been made worse by things he was looking forward to being stopped.\n\"Occasionally, I do get very frustrated with everything. And it feels like the entire universe is out to get you and make things as difficult as possible for you.\n\"But I think sometimes you just have to not dwell on things too much and take things as they come.\" \nCraig Russell's stepdaughter, Kelly Smith, had stage four terminal bowel cancer.\nIt was being well-managed by chemotherapy, according to Craig, but because of the pandemic, she was advised to have a 12-week break in her treatment due to the risk of catching the virus at hospital.\nShe died 12 weeks later, aged 31, leaving behind her now seven-year-old son, Finnley.\n\"From Kelly's point of view, chemotherapy was keeping her alive so it was best to deal with that first,\" Craig, from Macclesfield, says.\n\"We believe staying on the chemotherapy may have given her a month, three months, six months or longer. \n\"When you've got a young son, that's all the time in the world.\n\"You should never hear somebody of that age, especially somebody you love, coming out with the words that they don't want to die and they're terrified.\"\nCraig says Kelly would be angered by the way the pandemic has hit other people's cancer care.\n\"First of all, obviously, Kelly's care was impacted, and in my opinion, led to her premature death. \n\"She fought for the rights of cancer patients to be heard and treated. At the moment neither is happening.\n\"In my view, the government has completely neglected cancer patients in this country.\"\nThe government says: \"Cancer diagnosis and treatment has remained a top priority throughout the pandemic, with 1.86m urgent referrals and over 477,000 people receiving cancer treatment between March 2020 and January 2021.\n\"We continue to urge people to come forward to their GP if they have symptoms. As part of our additional investment in the NHS, an extra \u00a31bn is being used to boost diagnosis and treatment across all areas of elective care in the year ahead.\"\nOne Cancer Voice estimates at least 43,700 fewer people got treatment for cancer from April 2020 compared to the equivalent period before the pandemic.\nThat's based on stats from the health services in England (April to January 2021), Wales (April to December 2020), Scotland and Northern Ireland (both April to September 2020).\nSophie Mulligan from Liverpool is in remission from leukaemia. \nHer joints have been left damaged, meaning she lives in a lot of pain and is facing a long wait for surgery. \nThe 24-year-old's white blood cells had to be flown to America for treatment. Normally, the process for cells would take around four weeks, but Sophie had to wait longer.\nShe was concerned about whether her cancer would spread in those extra few weeks.\n\"I saw people moaning about trivial things, like not being able to go out and see friends or go to the pub,\" she says.\n\"And I'm thinking, this is a life or death situation for me, that is totally different.\"\nWith all the treatments she's had over the years, Sophie has developed a condition called avascular necrosis - which is the death of bone tissue.\n\"And that affects my hip joints, shoulder joints, elbow and wrist. \n\"It means that I am very restricted in mobility, I suffer from horrendous pain and it affects my day-to-day life.\"\nThe pandemic means that there's a long wait for the surgery, and instead, Sophie is having to manage with painkillers and not leaving her house.\nAnd while lots of people Sophie's age will be thinking about the country emerging from lockdown, she just wants to be pain-free.\n\"I'm more bothered about going back into hospital to have surgery so that I can live some form of a normal life again.\"\nBut not every cancer patient has had a bad experience during the pandemic.\nToyin Coker was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer the week before her 28th birthday, but is now in remission.\n\"I haven't had any appointments rescheduled, I haven't had any issues at all, every single treatment was right on time,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nWhen the pandemic hit, Toyin, from London, admits to feeling \"absolutely petrified\".\n\"You think about if the surgery or treatment is postponed, and how your body would react to that. \n\"You don't know if the delays will make your cancer worse, because I've never dealt with it before.\"\nSo she understands the fear many other cancer patients have felt during this time.\n\"It's very scary to hear the issues that other people are facing, because this is a life-or-death situation.\n\"You've got family members that are worrying as well. So it's a lot more than the person dealing with cancer.\" \nFor now, Toyin feels stronger \"and in a very good place.\n\"And I'm just really happy to be to be given the all-clear.

      "text": "Organisers of the Golden Globe film and TV awards have pledged to increase diversity by making sure at least 13% of its membership is black.\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association has been criticised after a report said none of its 87 members are black.\nMore than 100 Hollywood PR firms have signed a letter to say they will advise the stars they represent not to work with the HFPA until changes are made.\nThey accused the organisation of \"discriminatory behaviour\".\nThe HFPA said it was \"committed to making necessary changes\".\nIts members are all international journalists based in Los Angeles, who vote for the winners of the glitzy annual awards.\nThe HFPA said it would add a minimum of 13 black members, increasing the total membership to at least 100.\nThe threatened boycott could prove costly to the HPFA because its members often make their living writing articles from press conferences and interviews with film and TV stars. \nThe letter from the PR group, published on Monday, read: \"We call on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to swiftly manifest profound and lasting change to eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behaviour, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption endemic to the HFPA.\n\"To reflect how urgent and necessary we feel this work is, we cannot advocate for our clients to participate in HFPA events or interviews as we await your explicit plans and timeline for transformational change.\"\nTina Chen, president and CEO of Time's Up, added in a statement: \"We are proud to be in solidarity with the voices of over 100 Hollywood PR firms in calling for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to radically transform the Golden Globes.\n\"We agree that anything less than transparent, meaningful change will no longer be acceptable. The entire world is watching.\"\nIn its response, the HFPA added: \"We also acknowledge that we should have done more.\"\nThe group's legal advisers have begun to implement changes, \"including a comprehensive review of our governance and code of conduct\", it continued.\n\"While we recognise this is a long-term process, we will continue to be transparent, provide updates, and have confidence in our ability to change and restore trust in our organisation and the Golden Globes.\n\"As we do so, we invite others in the Hollywood community to join us in advancing racial equity in our industry.\"\nControversy about the make-up of the HFPA has been circling for some time.\nThe LA Times recently reported that there are currently no black members of the HFPA, and the organisation responded by saying it was working on an \"action plan\" to rectify this.\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, the sequel to 2006's hugely successful Borat, was named best musical or comedy film at last month's awards.\n\"Thank you to the all-white Hollywood Foreign Press,\" said Sacha Baron Cohen as he accepted the prize.\nNo. The publicists' accusations of \"ethical impropriety\" and \"unprofessionalism\" are nothing new.\nIt has been suggested repeatedly over the years that the HFPA's small and secretive membership pool means the choices of nominees and winners can be swayed by promotions and freebies from production companies.\nIn the Los Angeles Times expose, it was also reported that HFPA members were flown to Paris by Netflix in support of its comedy series Emily in Paris, which received two nominations at this year's Globes.\nMany critics expressed surprise because the show has had lukewarm reviews, whereas the critically acclaimed I May Destroy You was left out of the nominations.\nA source close to the HFPA told BBC News last month that it is common for journalists to attend set visits, premieres and press conferences, adding that members attend 15-20 trips per year on average. They said the airfare to the Emily In Paris set was paid for by the HFPA and not the studio.\nThe suggestion that such trips have any influence on nominations was \"absurd\", they added, pointing out that set visits to many other TV shows in the last year had not led to nominations."

      "text": "St Patrick's Day celebrations will once again be different this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin have been cancelled for the second year in a row, with many events across the island again moving online. \nPolice have warned that anyone breaking Covid-19 regulations in NI will face a \"robust\" response.\nBut while large gatherings are mostly ruled out, attempts have been made to celebrate in style around the world.\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, a record number of places are taking part.\nSome 670 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nThe quirkiest additions to this year's list include an abandoned sauna in Finland and a Smurf statue in Brussels.\nHere's how other places in Northern Ireland and further afield are planning to mark the occasion:\nBelfast has an array of virtual events for people to enjoy from the comfort of their own homes throughout the month of March.\nAn online disco, Irish language festivals and a virtual guided tour of the city's street art are just some of the events on offer.\nSeveral live music events will also be streamed throughout St Patrick's Day, showcasing the city's talent. \nSt Joseph's Church in Sailortown is one such venue celebrating with an eight-hour live-streamed event.\nThe St Patrick's Centre in Downpatrick, County Down is celebrating with a number of online events for St Patrick's Day and also to mark its 20 year anniversary.\nA new show about St Patrick, a children's virtual art competition and a series of podcasts from former BBC politics correspondent Martina Purdy and ex-barrister Elaine Kelly, who are pilgrim guides on the new St Patrick's Way, are just some of the events on offer.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Purdy said that some of the guests involved on the podcast are journalist and presenter Eamonn Holmes, as well as Irish cellist Patrick Dexter, who has found online fame with his open-air recitals, shot outside his cottage in County Mayo. \n\"I was probably less aggressive than I was previously with some politicians,\" she said.\nIt is claimed that St Patrick is buried outside Downpatrick Cathedral. A large granite stone marks the spot, placed there in the early 20th century.\nThe council's Spring and St Patrick's Day programme promises to \"bring some colour\" to the city and district, according to mayor Brian Tierney.\nHe thanked event organisers for a programme that \"strikes a balance between giving the public something to look forward to and celebrate, while also keeping everyone safe\".\nEvent organiser Jacqueline Whoriskey said: \"While we will not be holding any public events or gatherings, we have focused in on how we can creatively bring the spring spirit to our streets with artwork and installations, with fairy dwellings and artistic sculptures that can be enjoyed by everyone when out getting some fresh air and exercise\".\nArmagh's At Home With St Patrick Festival includes events such as online wreath making and an Irish dancing master class. \nAll events are free of charge, however, some do require registration in advance.\nThe council is marking Irish Language Week and St Patrick's Day with a series of online performances and storytelling.\nAll events have moved online and the festival includes music and dance performances, streamed live from the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh and the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen.\nThe council is streaming a series of craft workshops, musical entertainment and dance performances live on social media channels throughout the day. \nPolice in Northern Ireland have appealed for anyone celebrating St Patrick's Day to ensure that they adhere to all public health regulations.\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland on Wednesday, through to the early hours of Thursday.\nThe substantial policing operation will see officers patrolling beauty spots and the Holyland area of south Belfast.\nPolice said that a number of gatherings have already been broken up by officers in south Belfast ahead of St Patrick's Day.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that people know the rules and those breaking them could face fines.\nSaint Patrick lived in the 5th Century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nWhile St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nThe city's St Patrick's Festival runs from 12 to 17 March, with more than 100 online events around the theme of Awaken Ireland.\nOrganisers have partnered with Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 for the virtual parade.\nThe celebrations will be broadcast around the world to a potential audience of 80 million people, organisers said.\nThe Queen has extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.\"\nPresident Michael D Higgins said that the British monarch's visit in 2011 was \"such a moment of healing\" and expressed his appreciation for her \"good wishes on our national day\". \nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition will continue this year, albeit virtually. The bowl will be placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders will discuss, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland, according to the White House.\nMr Biden, who has strong links to Mayo and Carlingford, will no doubt want to celebrate his Irish roots. \nBefore a visit to the land of his forefathers in 2016, the then US vice-president said: \"Being Irish, without fear of contradiction, has shaped my entire life.\"\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River event but the city's mayor was determined to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nChicago's mayor Lori Lightfoot tweeted: \"Happy St. Patrick's Day Weekend, Chicago! Although we didn't gather, we were able to honor long-standing tradition by dyeing the Chicago River green, thanks to the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers.\""

      "text": "The first attendance figures since schools in England returned last week show high levels of pupils back in the classroom.\nIn primary schools, 95% of pupils were in classes at the end of last week.\nThe return has been staggered in secondaries to allow Covid testing, but 89% of pupils were in last Monday.\n\"Certainly for primary schools, the return of all pupils appears to have gone smoothly,\" said the National Association of Head Teachers.\nThis is the highest proportion of secondary school pupils in school since the first lockdown began a year ago - with a further 2% waiting for a phased return this week.\nSecondary schools have been carrying out Covid tests on pupils, screening them as they return, with the attendance figures showing how they were filtered back, with numbers rising from 30% to 89% through the week.\nAmong the 1% of pupils not in school because of Covid, the greatest numbers were self-isolating because of a potential contact with a positive case.\nThere were about 12,000 pupils absent because they were a confirmed or suspected case - but 33,000 were self-isolating because of a potential contact in school, such as someone in their bubble, and another 31,000 because of a potential contact at home.\nThe ASCL head teachers' union leader, Geoff Barton, welcomed the \"very high levels of attendance\" and said schools \"deserve huge credit for setting up what are essentially medical facilities\".\nBut he warned that in terms of future outbreaks in schools, \"we are not out of the woods yet\".\nHe added: \"We must sound a note of caution over what attendance levels will look like for what remains of this term, because we are picking up reports of positive Covid cases and close contacts having to be sent home to self-isolate.\"\nPaul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said he expected the government to \"keep a very close eye on the emerging data and assess the impact of the wider re-opening\".\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said he did \"not underestimate the preparation that has taken place to ensure our children could return safely\".\nHe added: \"It is fantastic to see the overwhelming majority of children have now returned to the classroom, with all the benefits that face-to-face contact with their teachers and friends is proven to bring.\""
