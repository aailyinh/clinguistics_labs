      "text": "The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia.\nPastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other.\nIf they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda.\nHe said it was \"time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity\".\nThe election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win.\nNone of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. \nWith 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. \nControl of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off.\nMr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. \nHe serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached.\nClaiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. \n\"The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,\" he said. \nIf both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives.\nMr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years.\nA Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast.\nMr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. \nMr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president.\nFinal results are expected later on Wednesday. \nThe margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler.\nEdison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. \nMore than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. \nMore than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election.\nAlthough the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers.\nThe two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency.\nIf it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state.\nBut Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state.\nIt turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST.\nThe prime minister is once again ordering us to \"Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives\" as infection levels surge. Wales and Northern Ireland are already two weeks into their own lockdowns, but they've also announced new virus measures. Things look similar to March in many ways, with the most vulnerable told to shield. We've set out all of the rules in detail. Boris Johnson admitted the coming weeks would be \"the hardest yet\". Scotland's lockdown will be reviewed at the end of January. England's rules are expected to last until at least mid-February, by which time the PM hopes everyone in the top four priority groups - some 14 million people - will have received a first dose of the vaccine. \nAll schools in England have been ordered to switch to online learning, except for vulnerable and key worker children. and this summer's exams will now not go ahead as planned. BTEC and other vocational exams will still take place this month. Nurseries and other years providers can remain open. Scottish schools will be shut until February at least, while Wales and Northern Ireland will also continue with remote learning for several weeks. Apart from those on a limited number of courses, university students must not return to campuses. See more on the risks around children and schools.\nBusiness leaders say government must act to limit another wave of closures and redundancies - and more state aid should have been announced at the same time as the new lockdowns. The embattled pub and beer sector said its \"road to recovery just got longer\", especially as takeaway alcohol sales will be banned - a blow to many small breweries and village pubs who have used it as a lifeline. UK Music, meanwhile, wants ministers to introduce an insurance scheme for cancelled events. The furlough scheme is still in place - read more about who's eligible.\nDuring the first spring lockdown, all professional competition ground to a halt, but this time leagues and tournaments can keep going behind closed doors. It'll give us something to watch while our own amateur sporting enjoyment is severely curtailed. Venues such as gyms, tennis courts and golf courses will be closed in England, and exercising outside is only allowed once a day. Organised outdoor sport for disabled people is allowed to continue, but children's football is suspended. The picture is quite complicated - for example, golf can continue in Scotland under strict rules -  so see our story for more.\nThe return to yet another lockdown, especially in the depths of winter, is likely to hit many of us hard. We'll continue to bring you uplifting stories wherever we can and offer tips on how to cope. Dr Radha Modgil from BBC Radio 1's Life Hacks shares her top five ways to stay mentally and emotionally well. BBC Newsround also has some tips aimed specifically at children. And if home-schooling is one of the challenges you're facing this morning, BBC Bitesize can help. Social and childcare bubbles also remain in place, unlike in March - a reminder of how they work.\nGet a longer news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.    \nPlus, all hope is pinned on vaccination to get us out of the current crisis.

      "tags": "Computer hacking,Spying,Russia,United States,Cyber-security",
      "text": "US intelligence agencies have said they believe Russia was behind the \"serious\" cyber compromise revealed in December.\nPresident Trump had previously suggested China might have been behind the hack, although other members of his administration had pointed the finger at Moscow.\nIn a joint statement, the intelligence bodies say they currently believe fewer than 10 US government agencies saw their data compromised, although other organisations outside of government were also affected.\nThey say work is still going on to understand the scope of the incident, which appears to have been aimed at gathering intelligence and which they say is \"ongoing\" a month after details first emerged.\nThe update on the investigation came in a statement from a task force called the Cyber Unified Coordination Group which was set up to deal with the incident. It comprises intelligence and law enforcement agencies including the FBI and NSA. \nThe group said it was still working to understand the scope of what had taken place.\nEighteen thousand customers who used Orion product from the company Solar Winds were exposed but US intelligence says it believes a much smaller number saw follow-on activity from the hackers in which they stole data. The US Treasury was among those which previously acknowledged being targeted.\n\"This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,\" the statement said. Many organisations are having to scour their systems for signs that they may have been compromised.\nThe incident sent shockwaves across the US partly because the breach was undiscovered for many months and was potentially far-reaching in terms of who it might have affected. It also suggested a degree of sophistication and stealth which was widely seen as a trademark of hackers from the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. \nSoon after the incident was revealed, President Trump raised the possibility that China might be responsible, but members of his own administration including the secretary of state and attorney general pointed the finger at Moscow. The latest statement shows the assessment of US intelligence agencies is that Russia was behind it, although it does not go so far as accusing the Russian state itself, saying only that the actor was \"likely Russian in origin\". Moscow has denied playing any part.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has previously said it was important to take \"meaningful steps\" to hold those responsible to account. It is not yet clear, though, what that might involve. While some US politicians suggested the breach might even be compared to an \"act of war\", most cyber-experts disputed this and the US intelligence community has now played down suggestions that it could have had destructive impact. \n\"At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence-gathering effort,\" the latest statement says. This is significant since it suggests no evidence has been found that this was preparatory activity for a more destructive cyber-attack which might switch off systems. This may limit the US response since espionage operations do not breach the cyber norms the US itself promotes (largely because it too carries out such intelligence-gathering operations against other nations). \nIn December UK officials say they believed a small number of UK organisations were affected but said they did not believe they were in the public sector."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "YouTube has reinstated TalkRadio's channel on its platform hours after saying it had been \"terminated\" for breaking the tech firm's rules.\nIt said the broadcaster had posted material that contradicted expert advice about the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut it explained its U-turn saying it sometimes made exceptions to guidelines that state repeat offenders face a permanent ban.\nTalkRadio said it had yet to be given a full explanation for the affair.\nThe decision to ban TalkRadio had appalled digital rights campaigners, with one group - Big Brother Watch - claiming it was evidence that \"big tech censorship is spiralling out of control\".\nThe Google-owned service has issued a brief statement explaining its actions.\n\"TalkRadio's YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,\" it said.\n\"We quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case.\"\nYouTube has not published details of the offending posts.\nBut independent fact-checkers have repeatedly challenged some of the claims made by interviewees featured by the London-based radio station.\nYouTube operates a \"three strikes\" policy, whereby channels that break its community guidelines three times within a 90-day period can be permanently banned, but other infractions lead to temporary restrictions.\nProhibited content includes \"medically unsubstantiated claims\" relating to Covid-19, and videos that contradict expert consensus from local health authorities such as the NHS.\n\"YouTube is making decisions about which opinions the public are allowed to hear, even when they are sourced to responsible and regulated new providers,\" TalkRadio said in a statement this evening.\n\"This sets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate.\"\nThe broadcaster tweeted the statement minutes after YouTube's change of heart. It did not appear to be aware that its channel had been reinstated at the time, but has since acknowledged the move.\nTalkRadio has about 424,000 listeners, according to the latest figures from market research provider Rajar.\nIt uses YouTube as a means to livestream shows from its studios and to provide an archive of past broadcasts. \nIts channel on the platform has 242,000 subscribers.\nYouTube's action had meant that TalkRadio's website had featured articles featuring broken embedded clips for most of the day, and that users who had shared its clips would have been unable to view them.\nThe US firm has previously imposed a permanent ban against conspiracy theorist David Icke, and a one-week video suspension of right-wing outlet One America News Network's ability to publish new clips - in both cases for breaches of its Covid rules.\n\nIt's pretty clear something has gone wrong at YouTube in the last 24 hours. \nIt appeared as though TalkRadio had been banned for good on YouTube - or \"terminated\" as the company put it. \nYouTube is now saying it was a short suspension, which certainly seems like a backtrack.\nEven now, it's not obvious what the offending material was that caused this action. The whole process reinforces the idea that YouTube's moderation policies - where it draws the line between freedom of expression and clamping down on misinformation - can be messy and inconsistent.\nAnd when YouTube takes such an action without giving full details, it rains controversy down on its own head.\nThis plays to a broader movement by YouTube and other social media companies to take a harder line on disinformation.\nJoe Biden is about to become US President - and he wants social media companies to do more to remove fake news. \nBut as they are increasingly finding out, refereeing their own platforms can be hugely difficult, and this highlights the need for greater transparency about moderation decisions.\n"

      "tags": "Egypt,Qatar crisis,Kuwait,Jared Kushner,Qatar,Saudi Arabia,Bahrain",
      "text": "Diplomatic relations have been restored between Qatar and four Arab states that imposed an embargo against it for three years, the Saudi foreign minister says.\nPrince Faisal bin Farhad told reporters that the countries had agreed to \"fully set our differences aside\" at a Gulf Co-operation Council summit on Tuesday.\nEarlier, Saudi Arabia's crown prince publicly embraced the emir of Qatar. \nSaudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism.\nThe tiny, gas- and oil-rich state denied the accusation and rejected the conditions for ending the partial blockade, including closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera broadcast network and curbing relations with Iran.\nIn recent months, Kuwaiti and US mediators stepped up efforts to end the stand-off.\nAt Tuesday's summit in the Saudi heritage site of al-Ula, leaders of the six GCC member states signed an agreement that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said affirmed \"our Gulf, Arab and Islamic solidarity and stability\".\n\"There is a desperate need today to unite our efforts to promote our region and to confront challenges that surround us, especially the threats posed by the Iranian regime's nuclear and ballistic missile programme and its plans for sabotage and destruction,\" he added.\nLater, Prince Faisal told a news conference: \"What happened today is... the turning of the page on all points of difference and a full return of diplomatic relations.\"\nOn Monday night, Saudi Arabia agreed to reopen its land and sea borders and airspace to Qatar. \nThe lifting of the embargo on Qatar has taken months of patient, painstaking diplomacy, mostly by Kuwait, but with increasingly urgent prodding from the White House as the Trump presidency draws to a close. \nThe three-and-a-half year \"blockade\" has been immensely costly to both Qatar's economy and to the notion of Gulf unity. Qataris will not forgive or forget in a hurry what they see as a stab in the back by their Gulf Arab neighbours. \nBut beyond the diplomatic rhetoric one country in particular - the UAE - has grave doubts that Qatar is actually going to change its ways. While Qatar denies supporting terrorism it has supported political Islamist movements in Gaza, Libya and elsewhere, notably the transnational Muslim Brotherhood which the UAE views as an existential threat to its monarchy. \nMeanwhile, the embargo has, if anything, pushed Qatar closer to Saudi Arabia's ideological enemies: Turkey and Iran. \nQatar has long practised an ambitious foreign policy with different priorities to some other Gulf states, but there are two key issues which have angered its neighbours in the past decade.\nOne is Qatar's support for Islamists. Qatar acknowledges providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. But it denies aiding jihadist groups like al-Qaeda or Islamic State (IS).\nThe other key issue is Qatar's relations with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field. The Shia Muslim power is Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia's main regional rival.\nIn June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed all diplomatic and trade ties.\nQatar's only land border was closed; ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports; and much of the region's airspace was closed to Qatari aircraft.\nThe countries presented Qatar with 13 demands as conditions for ending the embargo. They included closing Al Jazeera and other Qatar-funded news outlets, downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran, closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, and ending \"interference\" in other countries' internal affairs.\nQatar refused to comply, saying it would not agree to \"surrender\" its sovereignty and that the \"blockade\" by its neighbours violated international law.\nThe emirate quickly established new trade routes with Iran and Turkey to ensure the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million were met, and used its oil and gas wealth to prop up its economy.\nTwo states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman. Kuwait served as a mediator in the dispute. \nUS President Donald Trump unexpectedly sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies at the start of the dispute, denouncing Qatar as a \"funder of terror\" despite the emirate hosting the largest American military facility in the Middle East, al-Udeid airbase.\nBut Mr Trump's aides subsequently persuaded him to take a more neutral stance, and in 2018 he praised Sheikh Tamim's work on combating terrorist financing at a White House meeting.\nKuwaiti mediation efforts appeared to make little progress until late last year, when the Trump administration intensified pressure on all sides for an end to the stand-off that thwarted their efforts to assemble an alliance of Sunni-led states to counter Iran and its proxies.\nMr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar in December, and reportedly flew to al-Ula on Monday to attend the summit."

      "text": "There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. \nIf you have any of them, you should get a test.\nPublic Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one of these symptoms.\nPeople infected with new variants such as Delta may be more likely to have other symptoms, such as headache, sore throat or a runny nose, according to research from the Zoe Covid Study and an ONS survey.\nIf you have any symptoms you should get tested as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason. \nIt takes five days on average from the moment you're infected for symptoms to show.\nNo - it can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.\nScientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types:\nResearchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus in children.\nSome people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes or fingers.\nIt can happen to anyone, but is more common in children and teenagers. \nFor some it's painless, but the rash can be very sore and itchy.\nIt appears to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus.\nWriting in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers say they've pinpointed which parts of the immune system are responsible, which should lead to better treatments. \nLots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu. \nPublic Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it.\nIf you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started.\nMost people will only have mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and fluids.\nYou should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.\nSince 16 August, people who are double jabbed (or aged under 18) don't have to self-isolate if they're identified as a close contact of a person who tests positive.\nGetting vaccinated is the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation or death from Covid. \nIf you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you can't speak more than a few words.\nIf you're worried your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen.\nThe most seriously ill patients may require ventilation - where patients are sedated and air is pushed into their lungs.\nOlder people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some 1.3 million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, says the government.\nIn England, that includes nearly a quarter of the most elderly, vulnerable patients.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it meant that within a two to three weeks they should have a \"significant degree of immunity\" to the virus.  \nHe said there would be a ramping up to get more people immunised - up to 2 million a week. \nThe ambition is to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February. That will require around 13 million vaccinations. \nHe defended the UK's policy of immunising more people with one dose immediately - rather than holding some stock back to give people a second booster shot - in order to save \"the most lives the fastest\". \nUS regulators have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it is a pragmatic decision to protect more people.\nBoth the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection.\nInitially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose.\nBut when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the policy would now change - the new priority would be to give as many people a first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses in as short a time as possible.\nEveryone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first.\nEngland's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told the Downing Street press conference that extending the gap between the first and second jabs would mean the number of people vaccinated can be doubled over three months.\n\"If over that period there is more than 50% protection then you have actually won. More people will have been protected than would have been otherwise.\n\"Our quite strong view is that protection is likely to be lot more than 50%.\"\nAsked whether the longer gap could lead to an increase risk of the virus mutating into a version that could escape the vaccine, he said it was a worry, but a small one. \nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccines would probably need to be changed further down the line to continue to be a good match for the virus - but that this was relatively quick to do. \nOne of the exciting things about the science of the RNA vaccines is that they are incredibly fast to make in response to new mutations, he said.

an indication the vaccination process is working.   \nThere are approximately 82,000 people over 80 in NI and BBC News NI understands that if deliveries of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine happen as planned, it is thought that all of those over 80, as well as GPs and their staff, could be vaccinated within three weeks. \nWhile 50,000 doses have been delivered to Northern Ireland, a further 23,000 vaccines are expected on 19 January while another 68,000 are due on 24 January.\nDr Alan Stout, who is a GP in Belfast, told BBC News NI that members are \"very optimistic\" that 11,000 people can be vaccinated this week.\nNI's chief medical officer said the Oxford-AstraZeneca rollout would run alongside the ongoing vaccination programme.\nDr Michael McBride said: \"First and foremost we must act to protect those most at risk of severe disease and death.  \n\"The evidence shows that the initial dose of vaccine offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus. \n\"Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality and hospitalisations, protecting the health and social care system.\"\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has to be kept at an extremely low temperature which complicates handling constraints.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is considered easier to store and distribute.\nIts rollout consists of two full doses of the vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first.\nGPs are appealing to the public to remain calm and wait to be called for their vaccine either by telephone or by letter.\nDr Stout said as demand grows worldwide for the vaccine, that schedule could easily change.    \n\"The public have to be patient, we have a system and must be allowed to get on with it - it really is 'don't call us - we will call you'.\" \nWhile some vaccinations will take place in surgeries others will happen in a drive-through system.\nCovid-19 is deadlier than flu, which means January 2021 is going to be even tougher than usual. \nAlso, Covid patients tend to stay much longer in hospital with more severe symptoms requiring additional beds and care. \nBut those rising patient numbers aren't matched by an increased workforce.\nInstead it is expected that the nurse-patient ratio will increase (even though many aren't trained to work in critical care) as there simply aren't enough nurses available. \nSome health unions fear this will only add to Northern Ireland's excess mortality rate, which is greater than that in Great Britain. \nOnce again, this highlights Northern Ireland's failing health care system, which was already below par well before the start of the pandemic.\nCoronavirus infection figures here are expected to peak between 15 and 21 January. That will be felt not only in hospitals but also in GP practices as they continue to roll out the vaccine. \nWhile at this stage the six weeks look bleak it's hoped that the additional Astra-Zeneca vaccine and the low incidence of flu will go a long way in not only saving lives, but also protecting the health service.\nDr Stout said much planning had gone into ensuring the programme happened as smoothly as possible.\n\"People will literally stay in their cars and be asked to roll up their sleeves - it has to be safe and efficient in order for us to get through it and safely.\"  \nThe UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people.\nMeanwhile, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said it was \"appalling\" that the Pfizer vaccine was not to be administered in two doses within 21 days as instructed by the company and threatened legal action.\nDr Black was responding to news that the UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart.\n\"They have left care workers in Northern Ireland with a gap in their expected immunity,\" he told BBC NI's Radio Foyle on Monday.\n\"In that period doctors, nurses, porters or health care professionals could infect patients because they will not be protected against the transmission of the infection to patients.\"\nThe UK's chief medical officers have defended their Covid vaccination plan.\nThey said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab was \"much more preferable\" and that the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine.\nDr Black is to meet NI Health Minister Robin Swann later to express health care workers' concern over the change in vaccine policy."

      "text": "All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales.\nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nHowever, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans.\nMs Williams said: \"As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term.\n\"This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information.\"\nThe announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nA \"flexible\" agreement on reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities.\nHowever, that decision has changed following the latest announcement.\nChildren's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: \"It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people.\n\"Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,\" she said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the \"best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus\".\nEithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and \"not set in stone\".\nLaura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought \"much-needed clarity\". \n\"The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,\" she said.\n\"Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions.\"\nClaire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was \"really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward\" although \"it's not the ideal\".\nConservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: \"With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left \"little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances\".\n\"It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,\" she said.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nIt went into a level four national lockdown on 20 December.\nHowever, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\nThis delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day.\nAnd that's something the opposition parties have picked up on.\nWith all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th.\nI'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a \"confusing picture\" with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected.\nSchools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home from midnight, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nEarlier on Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Everyone in England must stay at home except for permitted reasons during a new coronavirus lockdown expected to last until mid-February, the PM says.\nAll schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from Tuesday.\nBoris Johnson warned the coming weeks would be the \"hardest yet\" amid surging cases and patient numbers.\nHe said those in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by the middle of next month.\nAll care home residents and their carers, everyone aged 70 and over, all frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be offered one dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nScotland earlier issued a stay-at-home order and Wales said schools and colleges would shut until 18 January  for most pupils. \nSchools in Northern Ireland will have an \"extended period of remote learning\", the Stormont Executive said.\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson told the public to follow the new lockdown rules immediately, before they become law in the early hours of Wednesday.\nAll the new measures in England will then last until at least the middle of February, he said, as a new more infectious variant of the virus spreads across the UK.\nThe PM added that he believed the country was entering \"the last phase of the struggle\".\nHospitals were under \"more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic\", he said.\nAnd he reiterated the slogan used earlier in the pandemic, urging people to immediately \"stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\".\nOn Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. \nA further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded.\nAs of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. \nThis is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high.\nThose who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said.\nSupport and childcare bubbles will continue under the new measures - and people can meet one person from another household for outdoor exercise.\nCommunal worship and life events like funerals and weddings can continue, subject to limits on attendance.\nWhile Mr Johnson said end-of-year exams would not take place as normal in the summer, he said alternative arrangements would be announced separately.\nThe government has published a 22-page document outlining the new rules in detail.\nThe House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would \"support the package of measures\", saying \"we've all got to pull together now to make this work\".\nOnce again it is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. \nIn England there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid since Christmas day.\nTo put that into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled.\nCurrently around three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease.\nIn some hospitals it is more than six in 10.\nBut what is worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to increase.\nIn the spring it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak.\nThe last six days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the UK - a number of these infections are next week's hospital admissions.\nIt is why the UK's chief medical officers were warning there was a \"material risk\" of some hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change.\nMr Johnson spoke after UK chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nLevel five means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement.\nNHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a \"critical point\" and that \"immediate and decisive action\" was needed.\nAnnouncing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"\nFor pupils who returned for their first day of the new term at primary school on Monday, it's turned out to be an extremely short-lived visit. \nBoris Johnson's announcement will see primary, secondary and further education colleges closed for at least the next six weeks, except for vulnerable and key workers' children.\nIt's a much bigger shift in policy than had been anticipated, even a few days ago.\nEven the return date will depend on the progress in tackling the virus.\n\"I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term,\" said the prime minister.\nKeeping schools open was the government's most definite of red lines, a few weeks ago they were threatening councils that wanted to close them - but it's now been overtaken by the spiking lines on the Covid infection charts.\nEven after the chaos of last year's replacement grades, GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled again - with a replacement system still to be decided. Vocational exams are to continue.\nFor parents dreading home schooling, there are plans for it to be better supported this time - with more computer devices available and suggestions that Ofsted inspectors will check what schools are offering.\nBut there's no escaping that this will feel like another sudden and chaotic change of direction for schools and parents. \nMr Johnson's pledge on vaccinations comes after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UK to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab\nSome 13.9 million people are among the four priority groups who will receive a vaccine dose by about 15 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.\nHow will you be affected by the latest developments?

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has called for a \"round the clock\" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases.\nAs part of a televised speech, the Labour leader said the government needed to deliver \"millions of doses a week by the end of the month\". \nHe said there were \"serious questions for the government to answer\" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but Labour would support the restrictions.\nBoris Johnson said daily vaccination figures would be published from Monday.\nThe prime minister has also said the four most vulnerable groups of people across the UK should receive their first dose by mid-February. \nBoth the PM and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have announced lockdowns this week.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December.\nEngland's lockdown will become law from 00:01 GMT Wednesday and MPs will return to the Commons later that day to vote on the measures retrospectively. \nThe restrictions come into force as the number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nOn Tuesday, 60,914 had tested positive in the previous 24 hours and a further 830 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn an address to the nation on BBC One, in response to Boris Johnson's televised address on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK had reached a \"critical moment in our fight against coronavirus\".\nThe Labour leader said people were \"angry at the mistakes the government has made\" and ministers needed to answer questions on why they did not act sooner over locking down England. \nHe stressed that Labour would continue to hold the government to account, but added: \"Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together.\n\"At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives.\"\nSir Keir reiterated that Labour would support the new lockdown when it comes to the retrospective Commons vote on Wednesday and \"join in this national effort\".\nBut he called for the government to use the lockdown to establish \"a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme\" to \"deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery\".\nThe Labour leader added: \"This is now a race between the virus and the vaccine and if we pull together as a nation, we can win.\n\"We need a new contract between the government and the British people: The country stays at home, the government delivers the vaccine.\"\nEarlier at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said more than 1.3 million people across the UK had now been vaccinated with either the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.\nThe figure included 23% of over-80s in England - part of a programme Mr Johnson said aimed to save \"the most lives the fastest\".\nThe PM said there will \"still be long weeks ahead\", but that he wanted to give \"maximum possible transparency\" about the vaccination roll-out.\nMore details will be announced on Thursday, with daily updates starting on Monday, \"so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making\", he added.\nAsked whether the target could be met, Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said the timetable was \"realistic but not easy\"."

In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition.

However, her death was then confirmed on Tuesday.\nRoberts had collapsed while walking her dogs on 24 December and was admitted to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre.\nHer partner Lance O'Brien mistakenly thought she had died on Sunday after visiting her in hospital. After getting a call from doctors to say she was deteriorating quickly, he went to her bedside, her eyes closed and she \"faded\", TMZ reported.\nDevastated, he walked out of the room and then the hospital without speaking to medical staff before informing Roberts' agent that he had \"just said goodbye to Tanya\".\nBut while being interviewed for US TV show Inside Edition on Monday, Mr O'Brien got a call from the hospital to say she was alive.\nThe moment was captured on film, as he picked up his phone and said: \"Now you're telling me she's alive? Thank the Lord.\" However, she died on Monday night.\nBorn Victoria Leigh Blum in 1955, Roberts grew up in New York before moving to Hollywood in 1977.\nHer big break came when she replaced Shelly Hack in Charlie's Angels, joining Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd as third 'Angel' Julie.\nAfter the show's cancellation, she appeared in such fantasy adventure films as The Beastmaster and Hearts and Armour.\nShe also played comic book heroine Sheena in a 1984 film that saw her nominated for a Golden Raspberry award for worst actress.\nRoberts received another Razzie nomination for her role as geologist Stacey Sutton in 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill.\nShe admitted being \"a little cautious\" about taking the role, but said it would have been \"ridiculous\" to have turned it down.\nRoberts' subsequent films included Night Eyes and Inner Sanctum, erotic thrillers that did little to advance her career.\nShe went on to play Midge Pinciotti in more than 80 episodes of That '70s Show between 1998 and 2004.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Or indeed that new lockdowns in England and Scotland aren't still dramatic and painful. \nWith tightening up in Wales and Northern Ireland too, the spread of coronavirus this winter has been faster than governments' attempts to keep up with it - leaving leaders with little choice but to take more of our choices away. \nThere is much that's an echo of March. Work, school, life outside the home will be constrained in so many ways, with terrible and expensive side-effects for the economy. \nThis time, it's already spluttering - restrictions being turned on and off for months have starved so much trade of vital business. \nBut there's a lot that's different too. After so long, the public is less forgiving of the actions taken, and there is frustration particularly over last-minute changes for schools; fatigue too with having to live under such limits. \nBy now, Boris Johnson's opponents, inside and outside the Tory party, have plenty of evidence to suggest that he would rather put off difficult decisions.\nBut there is another profound change, that the prime minister was unsurprisingly keen to point out on live TV, where the UK, at the moment, has a leading reputation. \nVaccines exist, partly due to UK science, and are being injected into willing arms already. \nThe scientific triumph still needs to be turned into a logistical victory. But if around 13 million vaccines can be offered over the next six weeks, we may be on the way. \nOne member of the cabinet told me: \"We should do absolutely nothing but this, the vaccine - it should be the entire focus of the government; every government shoulder should be put to every government wheel.\" \nIt's not just the country's health and economic fortunes riding on hitting that stretching target, but the government's reputation too.

      "text": "People in England are no longer legally required to wear face masks in almost all public spaces, although they are still recommended in some settings. \nThe change is part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures in England.\nMasks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nFrom Thursday 27 January:\nWhat are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?\nFace mask changes: 'We hope customers aren't discouraged'\nIn Scotland, masks must be worn in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).\nThey must be worn in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, and in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. \nThey are compulsory for all school staff as well as secondary school pupils and are required in indoor public spaces in universities.\nLike England, under-12s are exempt.\nFrom Friday 28 January, adults running organised sessions with under-5s will no longer need to wear face coverings. \nIn Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils must wear face coverings inside school buildings, as must staff if they can't socially distance.\nMasks must also be worn on public transport, in shops and hospitality venues unless you're sitting down to eat or drink.\nMasks aren't required in gyms or other exercise venues.\nHowever, people no longer have to show proof of exemption if they're not wearing a mask.\nUnder-13s don't have to wear masks in public indoor places, and primary school pupils are exempt from the rules on public transport.\nPeople no longer have to wear face masks by law in cafes, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, but face coverings are required on public transport and  most public spaces, including shops.\nSecondary school pupils are being asked to wear masks in class until the end of half term. \nThe guidance in Wales applies to everyone aged 11 or over.\nIn England, Transport for London (TfL) officers and police can currently fine people \u00a3200 for their first offence. This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Businesses in retail, hospitality and leisure will receive new grants to help them keep afloat until spring, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said.\nThe grants will be worth up to \u00a39,000 per property, the Treasury says. \nMr Sunak told the BBC he was \"committed to protecting jobs and supporting businesses\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the new help as a good start but warned the money still wouldn't be enough to save many firms from collapse.\nThe help is in addition to business rates relief and the furlough scheme, which has been extended until the end of April.\nFirms do not have to pay the grant money back.\nMr Sunak said he would consider whether or how to extend support packages in its Budget on 3 March. \n\"The Budget early in March is an excellent opportunity to take stock of the range of support we have put in place and set out the next stage of our economic response,\" he said.\nThe director general of the CBI business group, Tony Danker, earlier warned leaving additional support until the Budget could be too late for many firms, saying. \"the comprehensive restrictions required a new comprehensive response\".\nIt was a fear echoed by other business groups, the BCC and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). \nBCC director general, Adam Marshall, warned many smaller firms would not qualify for help and \"will be left struggling to see how this new top-up grant will help them out of their cashflow problems.\"\nHe also called for the support to be extended to firms in other sectors \"who are also feeling the devastating impacts of these restrictions.\" \nFSB chair Mike Cherry also said the funds would be a lifeline to many, but \"do not go far enough to match the scale of the crisis that small firms are facing.\"\nThe British Beer & Pub Association described the grants as a \"lifeline\", but added that companies on which pubs rely, such as breweries, would also need help.\nSeb Heeley, owner of distillery Manchester Gin, told the BBC that fixed dates to aim for are crucial for his business.\n\"We need a date to work towards and we don't have that so, again, we're in limbo,\" he said. \"It takes three or four weeks\" to prepare, including retraining staff, he added. \nHis business has been closed since October because of restrictions in the Manchester area. It borrowed money under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).\n\"We start repayment in June and there's good chance we won't be open, so they are going to have to extend that,\" he said. \nHe said much of the \u00a39,000 grant will be taken up by the \u00a36,000 a month his business owes in pension contributions and national insurance alone.\nMr Sunak said the new support would \"help businesses to get through the months ahead - and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen\".\nBusinesses such as cafes, restaurants, leisure centres and shops that do not sell essentials have been particularly hard hit by coronavirus lockdown measures as people are told to stay at home.\nAll non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues are now closed, with pubs and restaurants allowed to offer takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks only.\nThe new measures contained no additional support for self-employed people. \nMel Stride, chair of parliament's Treasury Committee, which scrutinises the finance department's work, warned the chancellor \"must not forget those who have fallen through the gaps around previous support packages.\"\nWhile this is welcome and essential support, it is now clear that the most optimistic timetable for economic lift-off from the pandemic is going to be put back.\nThis raises questions about the length of the furlough scheme, and government-guaranteed loans. \nBefore this, the best-case scenario was that mass vaccination, enabling a confident reopening of the economy, would allow furloughed workers to go straight back to their jobs in late spring. \nThis was never the government's central forecast, but looked possible amid optimism about the vaccine last month. \nEven if all vulnerable people can be vaccinated by March, the first three months of the year will see school lockdowns which will harm growth, and therefore a possible double dip recession. \nBusiness groups which welcomed this support say they now need a clear long-term plan. They want to know that current levels of support will stay in place until most of the population is vaccinated. \nHundreds of thousands of self-employed workers who fell through the gaps of support remain under huge pressure, particularly ahead of the self assessment tax deadline. \nA decision on extending the \u00a320 a week increase to universal credit will also be required.\nEngland's lockdown rules are due to be reviewed on 15 February while Scotland's will be reviewed at the end of January.\nIn the UK, the unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people.\nRedundancies hit a record high over the period.\nThe Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, predicts the UK economy will have shrunk by 11.3% in 2020 - the biggest decline in 300 years. It expects unemployment to peak at 9.7%."

      "tags": "Great Ormond Street Hospital,Twins,Cardiff,Senegal,Sully",
      "text": "Conjoined twins who were expected to die within days when they were born are nearly four years later said to be settling in at their Cardiff school.\nMarieme and Ndeye Ndiaye were brought to the UK from Senegal in 2017 by their father Ibrahima for treatment at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.\nThe girls, now four, are learning to stand and their father said their progress was \"a Herculean achievement\".\nTheir head teacher said the girls had made friends and were \"laughing a lot\".\nThe girls, who have separate hearts and spines but share a liver, bladder and digestive system, have conditions which put them at higher risk of complications from Covid.\nHowever, Mr Ndiaye said he had wanted them to start school for their development.\n\"When you look in the rear view mirror, it was an unachievable dream,\" he said.\n\"From now, everything ahead will be a bonus to me. My heart and soul is shouting out loud, 'Come on! Go on girls! Surprise me more!'.\"\nMr Ndiaye brought the girls to the UK through funding from a charitable foundation run by Senegal's first lady Marieme Faye Sall, before he sought asylum.\nIn March 2018, the family were moved by the Home Office to Cardiff as asylum seekers can be moved anywhere in the UK and they now have discretionary leave to remain.\nIn 2019, Great Ormond Street surgeons considered attempting separation but it was something Mr Ndiaye did not want because of the risks involved.\nSince then, doctors have found the girls' circulatory systems to be more closely linked than previously thought and neither would survive without the other, making separation now impossible.   \nThe girls' head teacher Helen Borley said they were learning well since starting reception in September and had made new friends. \nShe said: \"Children either say, 'I'm Marieme's friend' or 'I'm Ndeye's friend' - they don't say, 'I'm the twins' friend'. Children very much identify as being one person's friend or another - because the girls are very different characters.\n\"They are laughing a lot - which is always a good sign, isn't it? Any child that is laughing a lot is a happy child.\"\nFor the twins, school needs to fit around hospital visits.\nIn October, the girls needed surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. \nDr Gillian Body, a paediatric consultant at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, said the procedure was important, despite the risks.\nShe said: \"The girls have complex anatomies and that makes them prone to infections and potentially sepsis.\n\"One of the challenges we had was getting antibiotics into them quickly, and this tube or cannula they've had fitted, means we can get them into them more quickly with less distress to the girls.\"\nShe said Marieme's heart was complex with lots of abnormalities that cause her problems with doing exercise and can lead to breathlessness.\nAt children's' hospice Ty Hafan in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, the girls have been learning what it feels like to stand. \nA special frame gives them the experience of being upright, helping build strength in their legs.\nPhysiotherapist Sara Wade-West said it had been hard for them.\n\"It's a really different sensation when you're used to being sat down, to be upright can be scary,\" she said. \n\"To start with, particularly Ndeye wasn't very keen. We try and sneak the therapy in around the play, encouraging them to reach for toys to make them work a bit harder, but if they know it's therapy it's not so fun. \n\"Because of their cardiac function we can't push them too much so it's finding that balance - challenging them to get stronger but not exhausting them.\" \nWatching his daughters stand is more than just a breakthrough for their father.\n\"They are showing that they don't only want to live, but be active and play their part in society,\" he said.\n\"All these achievements bring light and hopes for the future. But I know how fragile, complex and unpredictable their lives can be.\"\nMr Ndiaye said his hopes were \"parallel to my fears\" as the girls had \"so many times come close to the worst\".\n\"But the very least I can do for the girls is figure out my hopes for them,\" he said.\n\"The most I can do is to be beside them and live inside that hope and never allow anything to take that hope away.\n \"They are my warriors. They have proved they will never surrender without fighting. It is not yet over.\""

Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males.\nAs he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream.\nMr White told AP he had heard police officers shout \"Drop the knife!\" before gunfire erupted but said he had not seen a knife in Mr Blake's hands.\nHe is accused of shooting dead Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and wounding a third man, during street unrest - in incidents also partially captured on video. \nMr Rittenhouse says the three men attacked him and he fired in self-defence.\nJury selection for his trial starts in late March.

      "text": "Potentially life-saving cancer operations have been put on hold at a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients.\nKing's College Hospital Trust has cancelled all \"Priority 2\" operations - those doctors judge need to be carried out within 28 days. \nCancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country.\nAnd surgery has not been stopped on the same scale as during the first wave. \nRebecca Thomas, who has had her bowel cancer surgery at King's College Hospital \"cancelled indefinitely\", told the BBC she felt like she had been left \"in limbo\".\nUntil she has surgery her tumour cannot be studied to see how aggressive it is, and so she won't know until then how significant this wait will turn out to be.  \nA spokesperson for the Trust, which mainly serves patients in south London, said: \"Due to the large increase in patients being admitted with Covid-19, including those requiring intensive care, we have taken the difficult decision to postpone all elective procedures, with the exception of cases where a delay would cause immediate harm.\n\"A small number of cancer patients due to be operated on this week have had their surgery postponed, with patients being kept under close review by senior doctors.\"  \nProf Neil Mortensen, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said he had heard from members that \"hospitals across London are having to cancel cancer surgeries as a result of the huge number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalised.\"\nBut it hasn't yet emerged as an issue affecting hospitals outside London. \nWhen Covid-19 hit last March, NHS England developed guidance on prioritising patients who needed operations, with emergency procedures that needed to be carried out within 24 hours coming first. \nThese life-saving operations have continued throughout the pandemic and there is no prospect of that stopping. \nHowever, patients in the \"priority 2\" category - who should have surgery within 28 days, to save their life or stop their disease progressing \"beyond operability\" - have found their operations being cancelled at King's.\nThe 28-day guideline is based on the patient's individual symptoms and the expected growth rate of their particular cancer. \n\"Delays further than that could have a negative impact on that person's chance of survival,\" according to Kruti Shrotri at Cancer Research UK. \nAnd delays in diagnosis and treatment in general can lead to worsening chances of recovery, she said.\nThis will vary dramatically by person and cancer type, but in some cases, a matter of a few weeks can make the difference between a cancer that can be survived or not.  \nGenevieve Edwards, chief executive at Bowel Cancer UK, said research showed \"even a month's delay to cancer treatment can increase a person's risk of dying by up to 13% - a risk that keeps rising the longer their treatment is delayed\". \nWhile this was \"really concerning to hear,\" she said, \"it's not by and large something we've heard is happening widespread across the country\".\nThis is an improvement from the first wave of Covid-19 when the NHS had to put a near-blanket ban on non-urgent surgery. \nBut for those patients who are affected, this news will be \"incredibly hard,\" and Ms Shrotri stressed that patients with any symptoms that could be cancer should not put off going to see their GP. \n\"The NHS is open,\" she said.\nSurgery is most at risk because of the shortage of intensive care beds - but other forms of cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, should continue. \nNHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses in England, said trusts were doing all they could to \"prioritise on the basis of clinical need\".

I asked them what other documents I could provide. \n\"They seemed to be just flat-out refusing anything I had and just wouldn't let me on the flight. Very upsetting really. \n\"Quite an awful feeling not to be able to go back to your own house and to not really be given an explanation why you can't go home.\"\nOther British expat passengers have also said that they have been stopped from boarding planes to Spain. \nOne passenger on board said that seven British citizens were prevented from boarding a British Airways/Iberia flight from Heathrow to Madrid on Saturday evening, despite having their green residency certificates, as well as negative Covid tests. \nThe exact number of flights and passengers affected has not been released by the Foreign Office. \nIn a statement on Monday, Iberia said that on 1 January, it received an email from the border police saying that registration as a European citizen was no longer considered to be a valid document to prove legal residency in Spain as a British citizen. \nHowever, by 19:30 on 2 January, the airline received a second email, confirming that the document could be used if it had not expired. \nA British Airways spokesperson said: \"In these difficult and unprecedented times with dynamic travel restrictions, we are doing everything we can to help and support our customers.\"\nThe Spanish Embassy in London tweeted a letter stating it was aware that during the current travel restrictions, there had been some problems for British nationals resident in Spain who had not been allowed to return. \nThe embassy clarified that green certificates were valid proof of residency. \nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \"We have worked closely with the Spanish government to resolve these issues.\n\"The Spanish Embassy in London has re-confirmed today that both the green residence certificate and the new residence TIE card [Photo-ID card] are equally valid in terms of proving residence in Spain, as set out in the [Brexit] Withdrawal Agreement.\""

This is not the situation we wanted to be in.\nThe chain is the latest of a string of high-profile retailers to hit trouble in the past year. \nThe sector was already battling with the shift to online sales, coupled with rising costs, including rents and higher minimum wages. \nCoronavirus restrictions which shut non-essential shops piled on the pressure. \nOthers that have run into trouble recently include Debenhams, which last month said it would cease trading putting 12,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, has also gone into administration, putting a further 13,000 jobs at risk.\nMeanwhile, Edinburgh Woollen Mills' brands Peacocks and Jaeger also fell into administration in November, putting 21,000 jobs at risk. \nAnd earlier last year, Oasis and Warehouse fell into administration in mid-April after failing to find buyers, and online fashion group Boohoo said in June it was buying the brands but closing all stores."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic,Vaughan Gething",
      "text": "It has been described as a \"momentous day\" in the fight against Covid-19 as the rollout of the second Covid vaccine begins in Wales.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said the start of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme was \"a key milestone\" in the fight against Covid. \nThe Welsh Government said 40,000 doses will be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week.\nMore than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose.\nThe number of mass vaccination centres in Wales will be increased to 22 and more than 60 GP surgeries will offer the Oxford vaccine - mobile units will also be set up throughout Wales.\nOne of the first people to receive the vaccine on Monday was Ralph Evans, 88, who was vaccinated at the Pontcae medical practice in Merthyr Tydfil.\nHe was one of eight people there to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Mr Evans said he was \"very grateful\" to be getting it. \nHe was followed by 86-year-old Derek Games, former mayor of Merthyr, who said: \"I'm delighted, I'm very privileged to have it.\"\nThe medical centre hopes to vaccinate 1,000 people by the end of January after being contacted on New Year's Eve about starting vaccinations.\n\"We received a hundred vaccines at lunchtime today,\" practice manager Kevin Rogers said. \"We hope to get through the hundred this week.\"\nMr Rogers said they would be asking staff to work additional hours on weekends to help reach the target of 1,000 people over the coming weeks.\nThe Welsh Government's priority is to vaccinate front-line health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and people over 80.\nPlaid Cymru said \"serious questions\" remained about the roll-out plans, while a professor in palliative medicine said she was concerned \"at the very slow apparent roll out\" for those aged over 85.\nMari Lloyd Williams, from the University of Liverpool, said \"huge numbers have self-shielded since March\".\n\"Apart from intense loneliness this leads to loss of confidence and reduction in both physical and mental and cognitive well-being, meaning that some may need to enter full time care sooner,\" she said.\n\"We need to be vaccinating 24/7 in order to get this under control and to protect our most vulnerable.\"\nThe Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures so can be administered in doctors surgeries, pharmacies and care homes.\nDialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, was the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Oxford.\n\"It is an absolutely momentous day,\" said Dr Gillian Richardson, who is leading the Covid vaccination programme in Wales.\n\"The vaccine has been prioritised for those groups where it has been harder to reach with the Pfizer vaccine - so we're prioritising the over 80s and care home staff and residents.\"\nMs Richardson said the pace of the rollout \"will be governed by supply\" and \"will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months.\"\nBoth vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks - a change from the previous advice of four weeks between jabs.\nThe change has been \"very controversial\", according to one GP who will administer the Oxford vaccine, but she agrees with the decision.\n\"The evidence suggests that a longer time period between first dose and second booster gives you better immunity,\" said Dr Rowena Christmas, a Monmouthshire GP whose surgery is part of the rollout pilot.\n\"The key thing is we need to protect people. If we gave 1,000 second doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week then that's 1,000 people who won't get the first protection.\n\"As soon as you have the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, within about 10 days you've got 70% protection from coronavirus.\n\"But if you are in the 30% that does catch it, you're much less likely to get severely ill and much less likely to go to hospital.\n\"We are in a crisis situation and we have to protect as many people as we possibly can.\"\nWales is under \"stay at home\" lockdown restrictions after a rise in Covid-19 cases - with more than 31,000 cases in Wales in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nThere are almost 2,700 people with coronavirus symptoms in Welsh hospitals - with \"more than half\" of the 208 critical care patients having Covid.\nBut Mr Gething said Wales' overall Covid incidence rate had fallen from a high of 636 cases per 100,000 people before the lockdown started to 446 cases on Monday.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas with nine out of the top 10 of the UK's most infected counties in Wales.\nLatest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\n\"Cases of the virus remain very high\" although rates had fallen back from the incredibly high levels from just before Christmas,\" said Mr Gething.\nThe British Medical Association in Wales said there was concern among staff that a 12-week gap between doses could lead to \"sacrificing some immunity\" because trials had involved a shorter gap. \nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford said the longer time between doses and the rollout of a second jab would see the pace of vaccinations increase.\n\"By the end of the month we will be doing in a day what we've been able to do in a week prior to Christmas, maybe more than that,\" he said.\nUnlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures so will have fewer storage and transport issues, making it much easier to use in care homes and GP surgeries.\n\"This is a game changer in the fight against Covid, it's absolutely huge,\" Dr Christmas, principal GP at the Wye Valley Practice, told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We need this vaccine because it's easy to give. We can now all get involved and start this rollout of this crucial vaccination programme.\"\nThe Welsh Government said every health board in Wales will receive its allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver.\nBut it warned the effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice remained to keep contacts with others to a minimum, keep a two-metre distance from others, wash hands regularly, wear a face covering where required and avoid touching surfaces others have touched. \nPeople have also been asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital to ask when they will get a vaccine and wait for a letter which \"will provide people with a measure of assurance\" and will explain how they will be contacted.\nMr Gething said: \"Today marks a key milestone in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\"Its approval will help us to speed up our vaccination programme and run more clinics closer to people's homes\".\nWhile Plaid Cymru are \"pleased\" with the second vaccine rollout, health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated and there's far too much variation from region to region - Welsh Government must not allow a postcode lottery.\" \nThe Welsh Conservatives previously criticised the speed of the first vaccine rollout, saying hope had \"dropped away\" for many over 80 who were \"desperately waiting for their appointment\". \nThe rollout of the new vaccine will be another injection of hope at a time when it's so desperately needed.\nAt least 22,000 doses will be available in Wales this week followed at least another 20,000 next week.\nThe hope is then to ramp up its distribution as supplies arrive, so that around 1.5 million people in Wales at greatest risk of getting really ill from Covid, for example older people or those who have long term health conditions,  can get a jab within the next few months.\nBecause it can be stored for much longer in a normal fridge, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to deliver in places like GP surgeries and care homes than the other Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\nGetting both vaccines out is now a race against time."

      "tags": "Companies,Tax,HM Revenue & Customs,Brexit",
      "text": "Some EU specialist online retailers have said they will no longer deliver to the UK because of tax changes which came into force on 1 January.\nBicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits said from now on, it would ship to every country in the world except the UK.\n\"We are forced by British policy to stop dealing with British customers,\" it said on its website.\nAnother firm, Belgium-based Beer On Web, said it was now shunning the UK \"due to the new Brexit measures\".\nThe companies are angry because they now face higher costs and increased bureaucracy in order to comply with UK tax authorities. \nHowever, it is unclear how many have taken the drastic step of refusing all UK orders.\nAt the same time, international shipping companies including Federal Express and TNT have said they are levying additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU.\nThey said this reflected the increased investment they had had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.\nThe moves follow changes in VAT rules brought in by HM Revenue and Customs on 1 January.\nVAT is now being collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation.\nThis essentially means that overseas retailers sending goods to the UK are expected to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3135).\nA government spokesperson said: \"The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. \n\"The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale, raising an anticipated \u00a3300m every year.\n\"Many EU businesses which currently sell goods to UK customers will have already registered for UK VAT under existing rules and HMRC is working very closely with those who haven't to ensure they can comply with the changes.\"\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said consumers would be \"frustrated\" if the new VAT rules were applied in a way that causes significant inconvenience.\n\"It's vital the government makes it clear to consumers as well as traders what the changes as a result of Brexit mean for them and how they shop. It should also work to ensure UK consumers can retain access to a wide range of competitively priced and quality goods.\"\nCampaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, told the BBC that the massive increase in international online shopping had led to VAT evasion on a huge scale.\nHe said the new HMRC rules were aimed at tackling that, but it was unclear how firms who failed to register for UK VAT would be dealt with.\n\"Why should a phonograph spares manufacturer in Idaho bother to register for VAT in the UK and how are you going to make them do it?\" he said. \"And if they send the package anyway, what are you going to do?\"\n\"For providing this service, [HMRC] intend to charge a fee to every company in the world in every country in the world which exports to the UK,\" said Dutch Bike Bits on its website. \n\"Clearly this is ludicrous for one country, but imagine if every country in the world had the same idea. \n\"If every country decided to behave in the same way, then we would have to pay 195 fees every year, keep up with the changes in taxation law for 195 different countries, keep accounts on behalf of 195 different countries and submit payments to 195 tax offices in 195 different countries, and jump through whatever hoops were required to prove that we were doing all of this honestly and without any error.\"\nDutch Bike Bits said it had many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade with them. \n\"Not being able to send parcels to the UK does not work in any way in our favour and it is not what we wanted,\" the firm added.\n\"If you're angry about this, and you may well be so, please contact your elected representative in the UK.\"\nOther firms held out the hope that their ban on exports to the UK might prove to be temporary.\nScandinavian Outdoor, which is based in Finland and sells outdoor clothing and equipment, posted a message on its homepage saying: \"No delivery to UK just now.\"\nIn a further message explaining its decision, it said: \"Due to Brexit, we have temporarily closed our store from UK-based customers. Ordering will be possible as soon as our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out.\"\nMeanwhile, mail and freight company TNT has said it is now imposing a surcharge of \u00a34.31 on all shipments between the UK and the EU.\nTNT is now owned by Federal Express, which has also \"updated\" its charges, a spokesperson for the two companies said.\n\"FedEx/TNT has been making incremental investments to adjust our systems, processes, resourcing and customer-facing solutions to ensure readiness for the change on 1 January 2021,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"To reflect these investments and the incremental cost of customs clearance, we are increasing transportation rates for shipments from UK to EU, and EU to UK.\"\nRivals DHL and UPS have also taken similar measures."

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Businesses in retail, hospitality and leisure will receive new grants to help them keep afloat until spring, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said.\nThe grants will be worth up to \u00a39,000 per property, the Treasury says. \nMr Sunak told the BBC he was \"committed to protecting jobs and supporting businesses\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the new help as a good start but warned the money still wouldn't be enough to save many firms from collapse.\nThe help is in addition to business rates relief and the furlough scheme, which has been extended until the end of April.\nFirms do not have to pay the grant money back.\nMr Sunak said he would consider whether or how to extend support packages in its Budget on 3 March. \n\"The Budget early in March is an excellent opportunity to take stock of the range of support we have put in place and set out the next stage of our economic response,\" he said.\nThe director general of the CBI business group, Tony Danker, earlier warned leaving additional support until the Budget could be too late for many firms, saying. \"the comprehensive restrictions required a new comprehensive response\".\nIt was a fear echoed by other business groups, the BCC and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). \nBCC director general, Adam Marshall, warned many smaller firms would not qualify for help and \"will be left struggling to see how this new top-up grant will help them out of their cashflow problems.\"\nHe also called for the support to be extended to firms in other sectors \"who are also feeling the devastating impacts of these restrictions.\" \nFSB chair Mike Cherry also said the funds would be a lifeline to many, but \"do not go far enough to match the scale of the crisis that small firms are facing.\"\nThe British Beer & Pub Association described the grants as a \"lifeline\", but added that companies on which pubs rely, such as breweries, would also need help.\nSeb Heeley, owner of distillery Manchester Gin, told the BBC that fixed dates to aim for are crucial for his business.\n\"We need a date to work towards and we don't have that so, again, we're in limbo,\" he said. \"It takes three or four weeks\" to prepare, including retraining staff, he added. \nHis business has been closed since October because of restrictions in the Manchester area. It borrowed money under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).\n\"We start repayment in June and there's good chance we won't be open, so they are going to have to extend that,\" he said. \nHe said much of the \u00a39,000 grant will be taken up by the \u00a36,000 a month his business owes in pension contributions and national insurance alone.\nMr Sunak said the new support would \"help businesses to get through the months ahead - and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen\".\nBusinesses such as cafes, restaurants, leisure centres and shops that do not sell essentials have been particularly hard hit by coronavirus lockdown measures as people are told to stay at home.\nAll non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues are now closed, with pubs and restaurants allowed to offer takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks only.\nThe new measures contained no additional support for self-employed people. \nMel Stride, chair of parliament's Treasury Committee, which scrutinises the finance department's work, warned the chancellor \"must not forget those who have fallen through the gaps around previous support packages.\"\nWhile this is welcome and essential support, it is now clear that the most optimistic timetable for economic lift-off from the pandemic is going to be put back.\nThis raises questions about the length of the furlough scheme, and government-guaranteed loans. \nBefore this, the best-case scenario was that mass vaccination, enabling a confident reopening of the economy, would allow furloughed workers to go straight back to their jobs in late spring. \nThis was never the government's central forecast, but looked possible amid optimism about the vaccine last month. \nEven if all vulnerable people can be vaccinated by March, the first three months of the year will see school lockdowns which will harm growth, and therefore a possible double dip recession. \nBusiness groups which welcomed this support say they now need a clear long-term plan. They want to know that current levels of support will stay in place until most of the population is vaccinated. \nHundreds of thousands of self-employed workers who fell through the gaps of support remain under huge pressure, particularly ahead of the self assessment tax deadline. \nA decision on extending the \u00a320 a week increase to universal credit will also be required.\nEngland's lockdown rules are due to be reviewed on 15 February while Scotland's will be reviewed at the end of January.\nIn the UK, the unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people.\nRedundancies hit a record high over the period.\nThe Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, predicts the UK economy will have shrunk by 11.3% in 2020 - the biggest decline in 300 years. It expects unemployment to peak at 9.7%."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "Internet providers are under pressure to do more to help low-income families afford data packages for their children to take part in remote learning.\nIt follows a decision to close UK schools to most pupils to enforce new coronavirus lockdowns.\nThe children's commissioner for England told the BBC that \"broadband companies really need to step up\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer added he thought the cost of data was \"a big problem\".\n\"We're asking people to endure very tough restrictions. And there has to be the other side of that contract,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"Everybody needs to try and make this work. And that includes the companies that can take away the charging for data. It's a serious situation.\"\nWhen questioned about the topic at a Downing Street press conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We are looking at... the potential costs to parents of online teaching, and we're going to do our best to support them in any way that we can and to work with the internet companies.\"\nThere is concern that some disadvantaged pupils are currently dependent on pay-as-you-go or monthly mobile phone subscriptions that only include a small data allowance because their families cannot afford or otherwise obtain a separate fixed broadband connection.\n\"There are 25 million pay-as-you go customers in the UK, and about seven million of those struggle with the cost of topping up their data,\" commented Chris Thorpe from the Centre For The Acceleration Of Social Technology charity.\nMany schools are using video-chat software including Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet to live-stream classes, assemblies and other activities, which all benefit from a fast, stable connection and can consume a lot of data.\nIn addition, other tools including Google Classroom, Tapestry and Class Dojo are used by pupils to submit schoolwork and receive marks and other feedback.\nThe situation became more pressing after the prime minister announced last night that England's lockdown would mean schools and colleges would remain closed to most pupils until at least the February half-term.\nTech for UK - a coalition of technologists and other concerned business leaders - has suggested one way forward would be for internet providers to \"zero rate\" edtech apps and websites, so that their data use would be deducted from a mobile subscriber's monthly allowance.\nHowever, it acknowledges the challenge in doing so is to pick which platforms to support without giving some providers an unfair advantage over others.\nThe Department for Education already runs a scheme for disadvantaged children who do not have access to a home broadband connection to temporarily increase their mobile data allowance. \nIn some cases, this involves an extra 20 gigabytes a month. In others - such as Three - it provides an \"unlimited\" data upgrade.\nSchools, trusts and local authorities need to request the support on a pupil's behalf.\nThe networks involved in the initiative include:\nIn cases when this is not available, the government offers 4G wireless routers - which use mobile networks to offer a wi-fi connection - as an alternative.\nIn addition, Vodafone provided 350,000 \"free data\" Sim cards to thousands of primary and secondary schools and colleges in November.\n\"We are actively considering what to do now about this new situation,\" it said.\nO2 pledged in October to donate 10,000 devices and 12 months of free data to \"vulnerable individuals\".\nAnd Virgin Media noted it had launched a discounted home broadband service for families facing financial difficulties and receiving universal credit.\nBT says it has already removed all caps on its home broadband plans to help ensure children can stay connected to their schools.\nAnne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, said she was also concerned about the provision of devices.\n\"A lot of children still don't have laptops. They're surviving on broken phones,\" she told the Today programme.\nThe Department for Education said it had delivered more than 560,000 devices to schools and councils in England between the start of the pandemic and the end of last year.\nIn addition, it aims to have delivered a further 100,000 laptops and tablets to schools by the end of this week to help get closer to its overall target of one million devices.\nHowever, teaching groups have raised concerns about the rollout.\n\"We must hear no more of rationing of equipment, as we did late last year,\" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) told the BBC.\n\"If the stockpiles exist, as the Department for Education claim they do, then they must be distributed urgently. We have heard too many stories of requests from schools not being met, or not being fully met.\"\nSteven George of head teachers' union, NAHT added that a website used to order laptops had been inaccessible over the Christmas break, so some members had been unable to make requests.\nIn addition, the Association of School and College Leaders suggested the government had \"never really got to grips\" with the issue.\n\"It is certainly sending out lots of laptops for disadvantaged children to schools. But there's clearly still a gap, not just in terms of the number of devices that are required but also in terms of whether families have sufficient connectivity,\" said general secretary Geoff Barton. \n\"This has happened because it is a crisis situation, and there hasn't been a great deal of time in which to properly assess the level of need that exists, but it does expose the fact that pre-crisis, there hadn't been a properly joined-up national strategy on digital learning.\"\nOthers have noted that the device allocation scheme does not extend to printers - which are needed for worksheets and other materials sent by teachers - putting low-income families at a further disadvantage."

      "text": "The UK \"cannot duck\" tackling inequalities of health, ethnicity, education and jobs post-Covid, a major review has warned.\nThe report's chairman, Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton, says a lot of work to repair and rebuild the damage will be needed after the pandemic.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) Deaton Review of Inequalities warned the fabric of society was under threat.\nLaunched 18 months ago, the review says Covid-19 worsened existing problems.\nThe review says there is a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle the disadvantages faced by many that this pandemic has so devastatingly exposed\".\n\"We now face a set of challenges which we cannot duck.\"\nSir Angus said: \"As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most.\n\"We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong.\"\nWhile the pandemic had highlighted the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and deprived communities, it also showed that the UK's best-paid and most highly educated have been \"much better able to ride out the crisis\", the report said.\nChildren from poorer households found it harder to do schoolwork during lockdown and have been more likely to miss school since September, it noted.\nAnd while the biggest risk factor for coronavirus is age, younger people have been hit harder by the economic consequences of the crisis.\nThe cost of the pandemic is \"just colossal\" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"We've seen the biggest reduction in national income, essentially in history, over the last year, we've seen the biggest public deficit in history outside of the two world wars, so there's no getting around the fact that the pandemic and the response to it has had a bigger effect on the economy than anything essentially in the whole of history.\"\nThe report highlighted the effects of the pandemic on different groups, including on education, which is \"probably more worrying\" than the overall economic effect, Mr Johnson said.\n\"The first lockdown lockdown saw a dreadful impact on the education particularly of poorer children... they were getting less in the way of online lessons from their schools.\n\"There's a huge private school/state school divide in this, but also a big divide within state schools between those children who had support at home, had the facilities at home - laptops and internet and so on - but who also had the support from school - so there's a big impact on education but also a very unequal one,\" he added.\nThe review is calling for extra support for children who have fallen behind and help for school and university leavers to find jobs. \nIt says the welfare safety net must be adapted so it supports non-traditional forms of employment, including insecure and self-employed workers, and minority ethnic groups must be given greater economic opportunities.\nProgress in reducing poor mental and physical health could be \"one of the clearest indications of success of economic and social policy\", it adds.\nMark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the review, said: \"Individuals are subject to a wide range of potential vulnerabilities around dimensions including age, ethnicity, place of birth, education, income and the nature of their employment.\n\"Where these vulnerabilities intersect, they can amplify and reinforce one another and play a huge role in driving unequal outcomes.\"\nHowever, the government said it was already spending vast sums to support people and the economy through the pandemic. \nA spokesman said: \"We're doing everything we can to ensure our coronavirus support reaches those who need it the most, which is why we've invested more than \u00a3280bn to protect the incomes, livelihoods and health of millions of people across the UK.\"\nThis included an additional \u00a39bn for the welfare system and \u00a32bn for the Kickstart Scheme, tripling traineeships, incentives for firms hiring apprentices and doubling the number of work coaches \"so that nobody is left without hope or opportunity\", the spokesman said."

The vast majority of children want to be in school as home-learning is not as good as being in front of teachers.\n\"But we have to understand the seriousness of the situation we face and have the confidence of staff that when they are in school, they are safe.\"\nShe said there was no evidence the new variant was more transmissible in children than adults.\nSchools will only stay closed after 18 January \"if that's the only thing we can do to suppress the virus\", she added.\n\"Clearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face contact for the majority of children is a really really difficult decision and it's a decision which has grave consequences for children.\n\"Education has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard to look after us all.\" \nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities - nurseries and other childcare settings remain open.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nPlaid Cymru called for urgent help for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nJane Jenkins, head teacher at Moorland Primary School in Splott, Cardiff, said: \"We started planning for this before Christmas. It's not really any surprise.\n\"We learnt a lot of lessons in the first lockdown about the difficulties some children and families had with online learning, so we've been able to tailor our support much better this time around.\"\nMother-of-two Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said parents were suffering from \"exhaustion\", but it was the right decision to close schools.\n\"In terms of how it's going to impact on families, I just think we're all tearing our hair out.\n\"Trying to get our kids to actually engage with online learning is a massive task... my kids just don't want to do it, I'm the last person they want to listen to.\"\nChanelle Taylor, a painter and decorator from Caerphilly, said she was worried about balancing schooling with running her business. \nShe said: \"The most worrying concern I have is that with my daughter goes to a Welsh school and we're not Welsh speakers. \n\"It's made a big impact at home trying to home-school her as well as me trying to find childcare to keep my business afloat. \n\"At the moment I'm managing with my mum doing childcare, but it's difficult for my mum because my brother has Asperger's so she also cares for him. At the moment I'm limiting my quotations and working as much as I can without bringing more stress home for my mother.\"\nSara Powell-Davies, who is also from Caerphilly, said she had struggled to get childcare for her four-year-old daughter and other parents she had spoken to had been frustrated by the timing of the announcement. \nShe said: \"You can't do things like this last minute, it's not fair on parents and it's not fair on teachers and schools. \n\"We've been scrambling around now trying to sort out childcare.\"\nStephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of the Independent Sage advisory group, said the focus needed to shift away from keeping schools open to keeping them safe.\n\"A lot of the talk has been about whether schools should be open or closed. Everyone wants schools to be open. We should also be thinking about the best way of making schools safe so we can reopen them as soon as possible,\" he said.\nHe suggested reducing class sizes, hiring more teachers and more spaces and dividing classes.\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said support needed to be made urgently available to children from disadvantaged backgrounds who \"will now fall further behind with their education\".\nShe added: \"Hubs for vulnerable children and the children of key workers are also a necessity alongside an immunisation programme for all school staff so that schools can become a safer environment upon re-opening.\"\nNAHT Cymru, which represents head teachers, welcomed the announcement, saying it had been \"inevitable for some time\".\nDirector Laura Doel added: \"It is uncertain whether the next two weeks will be enough time to ensure a fully risk-assessed plan is put in place.\"\nThe Association of Schools and College Leaders Cymru questioned why it had taken so long for the minister to reach a decision.\nBut Ms Williams said: \"We need to reassess the evidence, which comes through on a daily basis, which makes decision-making really hard. Sometimes, when the data arrives, you simply have to act\". \nThe decision in Wales came as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over Christmas.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nHowever, the latest available data shows both England's and Northern Ireland's Covid case rate has risen above Wales.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, with schools and colleges closed until the end of February half term and pupils being taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nOn Monday, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

      "tags": "Policing,Domestic abuse,Crown Prosecution Service,Femicide,Baroness Newlove",
      "text": "A fresh move is under way to make non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence in England and Wales, after the House of Lords debated the Domestic Abuse Bill. \nThe government has said it has no plans to change the law, arguing that non-fatal strangulation is already covered by existing legislation. \nHowever, campaigners say abusers who use non-fatal strangulation are telling their victims: \"I am controlling you and I can kill you\" - but too often are charged only with common assault. \nThis is what happened in Jenny's case. Her abusive partner used non-fatal strangulation as a means of control throughout the five years they were together. \n\"It was like his favourite thing to do,\" says Jenny, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. \n\"That sounds really awful and trivial but that is how it becomes as an abuse victim. You learn to accept that is part of your life. It was like something I had to manage.\"\n\"We would wake up in the morning and he would be in one of those moods, and I would see it in his eyes and I would think today's the day I'm going to get it.\n\"It could be something as simple as: 'I don't like what you have got on' - that would end in strangulation.\"\nEventually one night she did call the police during an attack.\n\"He chased me round the house and every time he caught me he would pin me to the floor and strangle me until I had marks. \n\"I had burst blood vessels. I was streaming with tears. I just kept thinking: 'This is how I am going to die.' \n\"The doors were locked. He'd smashed my phone. I managed to get to the window and shout and one of the neighbours called the police.\"\nHowever, she was dismayed by the police response. \"I thought it was quite lax. They didn't take the strangulation as seriously as they should have.\"  \nHer partner was charged with common assault. He pleaded guilty and was given a three-month sentence, suspended for 18 months. \n\"Strangulation needs to be a specific offence. I think the weak police response contributed to keeping me in the relationship,\" she says. \nJenny believed her partner would eventually kill her.\n\"I just kept looking in the mirror and thinking: you need to leave and you're the only person who can do it. \n\"So one day while he was asleep, I picked up whatever I could carry and I ran and got on a train.\"\nPoliticians and campaigners tried and failed to have a new offence of non-fatal strangulation introduced in the Domestic Abuse Bill when it was going through the House of Commons. \nDuring Tuesday's debate on the bill in the Lords, the Conservative peer and former victims' commissioner, Baroness Newlove, said she intended to table an amendment to the bill when it reached the committee stage.\nShe said non-fatal strangulation was currently not being picked up adequately by the police, as it often left no physical marks on the victim.\nShe described it as a terrifying crime, with many victims testifying they felt as though their heads were going to explode and they were about to die.\nPeers from other parties also spoke in support of a new offence.  \nNogah Offer, a lawyer with the Centre for Women's Justice, which has been at the forefront of the campaign for a new offence, says: \"We believe this is a real opportunity to make a difference.\" \nCommon assault is a summary offence that can be charged by the police.\nBut when it involves domestic abuse, it should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, its guidance says.\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: \"Non-fatal strangulation is a serious crime which is already covered by existing laws such as common assault and attempted murder.\"\nA spokesperson said the government would keep this area of the law under review, but said a specific offence of attempting to choke, strangle or suffocate a person is included in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and, according to the 2015 Serious Crime Act, attempted strangulation can fall under the offence of coercive or controlling behaviour. \nDr Catherine White, clinical director of St. Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, says: \"Strangulation often ends up being treated the same as a slap or a punch. \n\"It's a very different crime. Often there is no external injury to the neck, which is why it's a very powerful tool for the perpetrator.  \n\"It can cause confusion but ultimately it can lead to death.\"  \nA research project led by Dr White describes non-fatal strangulation as a \"gendered crime, with nearly all the patients female and the alleged perpetrators male\".\nAnd figures from the Femicide Census, which looked at the cases of women killed by men in the UK, found that in 2018, 29% died through strangulation. \nCampaigners point to New Zealand and some parts of the United States and Australia, where non-fatal strangulation has become a specific offence. \nMeanwhile, after help from a women's centre  and counselling, Jenny now feels stronger and happier. \nDespite the pandemic, she says, having finally escaped her abuser: \"2020 was one of the best years of my life.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "England is under a third national lockdown to try to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, amid high coronavirus infections.\nThe decision came after UK chief medical officers recommended that the Covid threat level be increased to five - the maximum level. \nThe government has published details about things you can and can't do - which have prompted a number of questions.\nThe government has decided to close both primary and secondary schools, but not nurseries. At a briefing, Boris Johnson was asked by a member of the public why this was the case.\nThe Prime Minister said he believed \"all places of education are safe\" but that there were \"very, very important reasons\" to keep early years provision open, because it would help key workers and vital services to continue. \nBut all educational settings remain open to key workers, including primary and secondary schools.\nWhen asked a similar question by the BBC on Monday, Chris Whitty gave a broader answer, saying, \"The reason that nursery schools are open is to allow people who need to go to work or need to do particular activities, to do so. And we all do know that children are very, very low risk of this virus relative to other ages, so it's not zero risks but it's a very low risk.\" \nThe government has been advised younger children are less likely to pass on coronavirus than older children.\nIn the Sage minutes from 22 December, the scientific advisers say the \"closure of secondary schools [is] likely to have a greater effect than closure of primary schools\".\nBut outbreaks have been linked to nurseries. Since September, 10% of coronavirus outbreaks or clusters in educational settings have taken place in an early years setting, according to Public Health England.\nCoronavirus poses a much lower risk to younger children and there is limited evidence it spreads in that age group. Scientists are still investigating the new variant, but there is no evidence it causes more severe illness in any age group.\nPrimary schools in many parts of the country welcomed pupils back on the Monday after the holidays. But after one day of in-person teaching they closed again to the majority of children, who are now learning remotely.\nThe prime minister said in his statement on the Monday evening: \"Parents whose children were in school today may reasonably ask why we did not take this decision sooner.\"\nHe stressed that children would still be safe at school, but that they were being closed because they could \"act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households\".\nBut on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday - the day before - Mr Johnson said: \"There is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe and that education is a priority,\" and urged parents of primary school children to take them to school if their schools were opening.\nThe government says it had to act after the coronavirus risk was raised to level five the day that schools reopened. This had never happened before and indicates there is a risk of the health service being overwhelmed. \nAt his press conference on the Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he had wanted to do everything possible to keep schools open, \"but, alas yesterday, it became clear that the data simply was not going to support that\".\nScientists and governments understand more about the transmission risks posed by different settings than they did last spring. But the rationale for why some activities and services thought too risky during the first lockdown are still allowed, remains unclear. \nWe asked the Cabinet Office to explain, but it directed us back to the prime minister's lockdown speech.\nWhile indoor and outdoor sports facilities are closed to almost all of the general public, elite sport will be allowed to continue.\nElite sportspeople and those on official elite pathway programmes can continue to train, and will compete behind closed doors. \nMr Johnson said last spring that the decision to allow elite sport to resume would \"provide a much-needed boost to national morale\".\nBroadcasting sporting events undoubtedly provides a boost to fans, who can watch from their own homes, while athletes are being regularly tested for coronavirus. \nBut there have been numerous incidents of Premiership football players reportedly breaking coronavirus restrictions, and of matches having to be postponed after players tested positive.\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport told us that \"rigorous protocols\" have been put in place by sport governing bodies, and that when elite athletes are not training or competing \"they must adhere to wider public guidance\".\nUnlike in March, places of worship are also allowed to open in England, although they are closed in Scotland.\nPlaces of worship provide spiritual leadership for many and bring communities together, but their \"communal nature\" also makes them  \"vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus\", the government says in its guidance for England.\nHowever, when the lockdown was announced, the Archbishop of Canterbury tweeted: \"The government hasn't suspended public worship, but some may feel it better not to attend in person, and some parishes are expected to offer online services only for now.\" \nSage has previously suggested that closing places of worship would only have a low-to-moderate impact on overall coronavirus transmission, but that the setting posed a high risk to vulnerable groups.\nDuring this lockdown, the law says people must only leave their homes for a \"reasonable excuse\" - such as to exercise or do essential shopping. \nBreaching this could result in a fine of \u00a3200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of \u00a36,400.\nThe Metropolitan Police has said that Londoners breaching the Covid restrictions will be more likely to face fines in this lockdown, having instructed officers \"to issue fines more quickly to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches\".\nIt says this means that people attended illegal gatherings or parties can expect to be fined instead of just the organisers and \"those not wearing masks where they should be and without good reason can expect to be fined - not reasoned with\".\nSince March, at least 25,000 fines have been given out in England and Wales, with most of these during the first lockdown for leaving home without a reasonable excuse. \nFines were used far less over the course of the second lockdown. \nA return of tougher rules (with fewer \"reasonable excuses\") could see these fines increase again.\nHowever, the Police Federation has warned that during this lockdown, there could be added pressure on policing due to officers being off sick or self-isolating - affecting up to 15% of some police forces.

      "tags": "Primary schools,NI education,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,State schools,Grammar schools",
      "text": "Post-primary transfer tests have been cancelled in Northern Ireland amid a Covid-19 surge.\nThe decision was announced just four days before thousands of pupils were due to sit the first of a series of exams on Saturday.\nThe tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools.\nIt comes as schools are likely to shut until after the half-term break in mid-February as part of efforts to stem the soaring number of coronavirus cases.\nNorthern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed.\nWith more than 12,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last seven days, further restrictions are coming and Stormont ministers are meeting later to discuss them.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 1,378 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.\nThere have also been 18 more Covid-19 related deaths.\nThe number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nAccording to government figures on Tuesday, the number of people who have tested positive reached 60,916.\nCOVIDCare NI Mobile App is now providing daily updates of the latest statistics related to coronavirus.\nThe transfer tests are run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) and the Post Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC). \nThe AQE tests were due to go ahead on 9, 16 and 23 January.\nThe PPTC test was due to take place on Saturday 30 January with a supplementary test on Saturday 6 February.\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, AQE said the tests would not take place in January due to the executive's decision to close schools.\nIt said it would now consult with the 34 grammar schools that use its tests about a way forward.\nThe PPTC said an expected announcement by the executive that schools would move to remote learning for many pupils until late February meant their tests would not proceed.\n\"If no pupils are able to sit the Entrance Assessment on 30 January 2021 because of Covid restrictions, and these restrictions would not have ended before 6 February 2021 then PPTC will be unable to provide an assessment for any pupils,\" said a PPTC statement.\n\"The responsibility falls on PPTC schools to ensure that their admissions criteria cover this contingency.\n\"PPTC accept that this decision may be disappointing to many children who would have welcomed the opportunity to take the assessment.\"\nSome grammar schools had already outlined how they would admit pupils using \"Covid-19 criteria\" if transfer tests were cancelled.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, whose party Sinn F\u00e9in is opposed to the transfer test, was among those who had been calling for the exams to be cancelled.\nShe tweeted: \"The decision to cancel transfer tests due to take place this week is welcome. \n\"This year has been emotionally and mentally challenging enough for children without the burden of these exams. \n\"DUP minister now needs to provide clarity on other exams.\"\nColin Torrens, principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, said the decision to cancel at such a late stage was \"shocking\" but it was the right decision.\n\"Children have been put through 12 months of all that hard work only to have it all called off at the last minute,\" he said. \n\"They have worked over Christmas, they have worked over holidays and this really should have all been sorted in May.\"\nThe executive is to meet later to discuss more Covid-19 restrictions including arrangements for schools.\nThe Department for Education (DE) is proposing many pupils should switch to remote learning for a prolonged period.\nBut schools will be expected to remain open to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers.\nIt is also likely that nursery schools and pre-school settings will close although they are likely also to be asked to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers.\nBut whether special schools should remain open to all pupils is among the measures as yet undecided, BBC News NI understands.\nMs O'Neill said details of what the executive agreed on Monday would be formalised at an executive meeting on Tuesday, where the health and education ministers will bring separate papers.\nMinisters are then due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday.\nNorthern Ireland's Education Minister Peter Weir had previously announced a staggered return to school for pupils during the month of January.\nSchools in England, Scotland and Wales are closed to most pupils, and the government in the Republic of Ireland is considering a proposal to close schools for the rest of January.\nAlternative arrangements for GCSE, AS, A-level and vocational exams will also be discussed by the executive on Tuesday.\nThere have already been a number of changes, including fewer exams and reduced content in many courses.\nHowever, the government in England announced on Tuesday that GCSE and A-level exams would be cancelled there.\nIt is not yet clear what alternative arrangements will be put in place in England, with the Education Minister Gavin Williamson to make an announcement on that on Wednesday.\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments announced last month that they would scrap the exams in 2021.\nJustin McCamphill, of teachers' union the NASUWT, said the education minister should scrap GCSEs and A-level exams in Northern Ireland.\n\"If GCSEs and A-levels can't run in England I really don't see why they would continue to run here,\" said Mr McCamphill.\n\"We are not going to be looking at a level playing field and it would not be good for our young people if they were being judged by a different system than children across the rest of UK.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Morrisons,Alcohol,Christmas,Retailing,Supermarkets,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it saw a shift in shoppers' behaviour in the run-up to Christmas as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.\nIt said that customers started shopping early to secure their festive treats, with traditional Christmas goods in strong demand. \nChampagne sales jumped 64% over the key Christmas trading period, while sales of whole salmon increased by 40%.\nMorrisons also said it would offer its car parks to host vaccination centres.\nThe supermarket's chief executive, David Potts, saidthree of its supermarket car parks would be hosting coronavirus vaccinations from Monday, and it would offer another 47 locations to help with the vaccine rollout.\nOverall sales at Morrisons rose by 9.3% in the three weeks to 3 January, compared with the same period last year.\n\"The pandemic has had a severe effect on people and communities around Britain for nine months now but it has been especially hard at Christmas time,\" Mr Potts said.\n\"I'm very pleased with the way the Morrisons team has helped our customers across the nation enjoy their Christmas in the best way they could.\"\nThe supermarket also suggested that festive sales had been driven by the fact that rules around larger family gatherings changed in England, meaning customers had to buy for last-minute smaller festivities.\nIn the nine weeks to 3 January, like-for-like sales, stripping out the effect of new shops opening and fuel sales, were up 8.5% and in the six months to the same date they rose 8.1% compared with a year ago, boosted by strong online sales and that of its wholesale business.\nMorrisons said it had also benefitted from out-of-home eating and drinking being restricted by strict Covid-19 regulations.\nSupermarkets were classified as essential retailers in England's second national lockdown between 5 November and 2 December, while restaurants and cafes could only operate takeaway services.\nAccording to new figures from market research firm Kantar, British people forked out \u00a311.7bn in supermarkets throughout December in the sector's busiest month on record.\nSupermarket trading was boosted by the \u00a34bn that would normally have been spent on food and drink outside the home over the Christmas season, it said.\n\"While celebrations may have been more low key, there were also signs of consumers keeping merry and indulging after a tough year\", said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.\nCheese sales, for example, increased by 17% and chilled desserts by 15%. Meanwhile, alcohol sales rose by \u00a3310m, with options to drink in pubs, bars and restaurants limited.\nThe firm also found that online grocery sales accounted for 12.6% of total spend in December, compared with 7.4% in 2019.\nDecember is always busy for the supermarkets but this one has been the busiest on record. \nWith all the restrictions and the closure of pubs and restaurants across much of the UK, people have had to eat and drink at home instead. According to Kantar, we spent \u00a312bn last month, the highest amount of groceries sales ever. \nIt's been a Christmas like no other but it seems we were determined to enjoy it. Aldi reported exceptional demand for its premium products yesterday. Morrisons says champagne sales were up 64% on last year. \nAll the supermarkets will be toasting bumper festive sales this year and with another national lockdown in place, they're set to enjoy continuing increased demand for another few months. \nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Morrisons' trading update marked a \"significant milestone\" for the supermarket chain.\n\"Morrisons is an underdog in some ways, especially when looking at the online business, which is smaller than some rivals. \n\"The pandemic has given the group a chance to address this, and digital sales have more than tripled so far this quarter.\n\"The question now is if Morrisons can keep a firm grasp on that momentum, and push growth long and hard enough to give its competitors something to worry about,\" she added.\nSeparately, clothing and homeware retailer Next reported a big uplift in online sales over the festive period.\nOnline sales saw a jump of 36% in the nine weeks to 26 December compared with the same period last year, off-setting the 43% fall seen in stores. \nAs a result, sales were 1.1% lower overall. The retailer said shoppers had shunned party outfits and work clothes in favour of loungewear.\nNext boss Simon Wolfson said that profits from better-than-expected sales in November and December would, however, be wiped out by fresh lockdown restrictions in England that would force 90% of its stores to close.\nIt also has to account for additional costs stemming from disruption to its traditional Boxing Day sale and clearing stock leftover in its shops.\nDespite lockdown restrictions, Next is \"likely to flourish as we emerge from this pandemic\", said Julie Palmer, a partner at the financial consultant Begbies Traynor.\nShe added that the recent administrations of the Arcadia Group and Debenhams might drive more shoppers to the retailer, as they turn to other familiar British brands.\n\"However, with no assurances of how long social distancing measures will be implemented and consumers now shopping for a purpose, not a pastime, the business must continue to manage costs and innovate if it is to take full advantage of these opportunities.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Secondary education,Coronavirus testing,Young people,Liverpool,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

      "tags": "Georgia,US election 2020,Donald Trump,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "In duelling rallies, President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden have urged voters in Georgia to turn out for elections on Tuesday that will decide which party controls the Senate. \nMr Trump, a Republican, and Mr Biden, a Democrat, said the votes for two Senate seats would shape the US for years.\nMore than three million Georgians have already cast ballots - nearly 40% of the state's registered voters. \nIf the Democrats win, they will control all of Congress and the White House.\nThe Republican Senate incumbents in Georgia - Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue - are trying to hold off the Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock.\nThe runoff is needed under Georgia's state election rules because none of the Senate candidates received more than 50% of the vote in November's US election. Voting begins at 07:00 (12:00 GMT) and ends about 12 hours later.\nThe vote will decide the balance of power in the US Senate.\nRepublicans are currently in control, holding 52 of the 100 seats. If both Democrats win on Tuesday, the Senate will be evenly split, allowing incoming Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote.\nThis would be crucial for pushing through Mr Biden's progressive agenda, including key issues such as health care and environmental regulations - issues with strong Republican opposition.\nThe Senate also has the power to approve or reject Mr Biden's nominees for cabinet and judicial posts.\nIf Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock both win, it will bring the White House, Senate and the House of Representatives under Democratic control for the first time since President Barack Obama's election in 2008.\nAt a drive-in rally in Atlanta on Monday, Mr Biden told voters: \"Georgia, the whole nation is looking to you. The power is literally in your hands.\"\nFlanked by Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock, he said: \"Unlike any time in my career, one state - one state - can chart the course, not just for the four years but for the next generation.\"\nMr Biden also took aim at Mr Trump, accusing him of \"whining and complaining\" about November's presidential election result rather than concentrating on the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"I don't know why he still wants the job, he doesn't want to do the work,\" he said.\nOn Monday evening at a rally in Dalton, President Trump told voters that the Georgia runoff was the \"last line of defence\" against the Democrats.\nIn what may have been the last rally of his presidency, he told the state's voters \"the whole world is watching\" and that this was \"your last chance to save the America that we love\".\nThe president repeated unproven allegations that he was only declared the loser in Georgia after November's White House election because of fraud.\nRepublican officials are worried this could depress turnout among the party faithful in Tuesday's vote. Mr Trump played this down, telling voters to \"swarm it tomorrow\".\nA Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years, but the party will be buoyed by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. The margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast.\nMr Biden won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the US president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. \nIt's just over two weeks until Joe Biden's inauguration, but the first real test of his presidency will come on Tuesday, when Georgia's two run-off Senate elections will decide which party controls the US Senate as he takes office.\nIf Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. The narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators.\nIt will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice.\nIf the Republicans hold on, then Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates.\nMr Trump - who is due to leave office on 20 January - said at his Georgia rally: \"They're not taking this White House. We're going to fight like hell.\"\nHe hinted that he wanted Vice-President Mike Pence, in his role as president of the Senate, to reject Mr Biden's win when Congress meets on Wednesday to certify the election results.\n\"I hope that Mike Pence comes through for us,\" Mr Trump said. \"Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much.\"\nSome Republicans have said they will raise objections to the presidential election result in the House and Senate, requiring a debate and vote. But with other Republicans saying they will not contest Mr Biden's victory, the votes questioning it would not succeed.\nOver the weekend it was revealed Mr Trump also held a controversial phone call with Georgia's top election official, secretary of state Brad Raffensperger.\nIn a recording of the call, first published by the Washington Post newspaper on Sunday, Mr Trump pressured Mr Raffensperger to \"find\" votes that would reverse his defeat in the state. \nAt his rally, Mr Biden did not make direct reference to the call, but alluded to Mr Trump's persistent challenges to the election results, saying that \"politicians cannot assert, take or seize power\".

      "text": "The leader of the far-right Proud Boys group has been released after his arrest on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter flag last month.\nEnrique Tarrio faces destruction of property charges. On Tuesday, a judge ordered him to stay out of Washington. \nHe has reportedly admitted torching a banner taken from a black church during a rally in December in the city. \nPresident Donald Trump has been urging supporters to gather in the capital this week for another demonstration.\nOn Tuesday, a judge released him on his own recognisance pending his trial.\nOn Wednesday, members of Congress are due to certify Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's election victory before he takes office on 20 January.\nMr Tarrio has said on the social media app Parler that the Proud Boys will \"turn out in record numbers on Jan 6th\", referring to his members as \"the most notorious group of extraordinary gentlemen\".\nThe National Guard has been deployed by Washington DC's mayor to assist local authorities. Officials say the troops will not be armed and will be there to assist with crowd management and traffic control.\nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department, Dustin Sternbeck, told the Washington Post on Monday that Mr Tarrio had been stopped in a vehicle shortly after it entered the district.\nThe 36-year-old was also found during his arrest to be in unlawful possession of two devices that allow guns to hold additional bullets, a source told CBS News. \nThe destruction of property charge relates to a protest in Washington DC on 12 December in support of the outgoing Republican president's unsubstantiated claims of systemic election fraud.\nThe mostly peaceful demonstration ended in isolated scuffles as confrontations with counter-protesters broke out. Police said more than three dozen people were arrested and four churches were vandalised.\nMr Tarrio - who lives in Miami, where he also reportedly runs a grassroots organisation called Latinos for Trump - told the Washington Post at the time that he had burned the Black Lives Matter flag.\n\"Let's make this simple,\" he said. \"I did it.\" \nBut he maintained he did not know the Asbury United Methodist Church, where the flag had reportedly flown, was predominantly attended by African American worshippers.\nMr Tarrio also said Proud Boy members have had their flags and hats stolen in past demonstrations without anyone being arrested for those alleged incidents.\nEarlier on Monday, another black church that was vandalised during December's protest sued Mr Tarrio and the Proud Boys.\nThe Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church accused the group of climbing over a fence and tearing down a Black Lives Matter sign.\nKristen Clarke, head of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement: \"Black churches and other religious institutions have a long and ugly history of being targeted by white supremacists in racist and violent attacks meant to intimidate and create fear. \n\"Our lawsuit aims to hold those who engage in such action accountable.\"\nThe city's police department said last month it had been considering a potential hate crime charge over the incident."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "All eyes are on the southern state of Georgia, where the future of the US Senate will be decided this week. Here's all you need to know.\nThere are two races and voting has been going on since mid-December.\nThe outcome will be crucial to how much the incoming Democratic president, Joe Biden, will be able to achieve in his first term.\nWait, another US election?  Wasn't all this done in November? \nOK, rewind.\nAccording to the state rules, a winning candidate needs 50% of the votes and in November no-one achieved that.\nSo the top two go through to a 5 January replay - a so-called run-off.\nIn both races, we have a Republican incumbent up against a Democratic newcomer. \nSenator David Perdue, 70, v Jon Ossoff, 33\nMr Perdue has served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally to the president. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees. He has denied wrongdoing.\nMr Ossoff launched his campaign with an endorsement from civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Before taking the reins of a documentary film company, Insight TWI, he spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat. He has employed his filmmaking skills on the trail, launching campaign accounts on both Snapchat and TikTok.\nSenator Kelly Loeffler, 50, v Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51\nMs Loeffler, the junior Georgia senator, is still a political novice. She was named to the US Senate in December 2019 by Governor Brian Kemp after the sitting senator resigned. One of the wealthiest members of the Senate, Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The ownership has caused a stir after the league's players called for Ms Loeffler to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter.\nRev Warnock is a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. Along with Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams, he started the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation by Georgia's Republican secretary of state for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents.\nThe upper chamber of US Congress, the Senate, has been controlled by the Republican Party since 2014.\nIt's very important in getting laws passed, Cabinet appointments confirmed and Supreme Court Justices on to the bench of the highest court.\nIf Democrats win in Georgia, the extra two seats would give them effective control.\nEach party would have 50 senators and it's become increasingly rare for senators to vote against their party. \nTechnically, there are currently 46 Democrats and two independent Senators - Bernie Sanders and Angus King - but they typically vote with Democrats.\nSo in a 50-50 tie, Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris would have the deciding vote in her role as Senate president.\nIf Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. \nThe narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators.\nIt will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice.\nIf the Republicans hold on, then that would mean two more years of divided government and, probably, legislative gridlock. Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates.\nA huge amount of money has poured in for all four candidates, but record-breaking numbers for the Democrats.\nThe Loeffler-Warnock race has received more media attention, partly because it's been more feisty and vocal.\nShe accuses him of being a \"radical liberal\" who courts Marxism and wants to defund the police.\nHe sticks to a pretty centrist Democratic message of pandemic relief and healthcare.\nWith his MLK Jr links, Rev Warnock is well known among African Americans and the state has a higher proportion of black voters than the average US state.\nThe state is around 52% non-Latino white and 33% black, according to 2019 census data.\nBlack residents made up nearly half of the 1.9 million increase in Georgia's voting population since 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2019, 2.5 million black voters made up a third of the total Georgia electorate. \nThe Biden-Harris win in the state was the first time in 30 years Georgia went to a Democratic presidential candidate.\nOn election-eve, President Donald Trump held a rally to support the two Republicans, urging them to turn out. Mr Perdue, however, participated virtually after coming into contact with a Covid-positive individual. He and his wife have tested negative, but have remained in quarantine.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden campaigned on behalf of the two Democrats on 4 January as well, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris travelling to the state a day earlier.\nA Democrat has not won in a Senate race in Georgia for decades so it will be an uphill struggle for them.\nThe Republican candidates also won more votes in both races when it was a larger field in November.\nBut Mr Biden narrowly won there in the presidential contest by tapping into an effective get-out-to-vote campaign among African Americans.\nVoting began weeks ago and early indications suggest a high turnout, possibly a record for a run-off in the state.\nBallot counting will begin at 19:00 local time on Tuesday, once polls close, though there could be a wait for results.\nPolling shows a very tight contest in both races even with less than a day left, though many are looking at polls with scepticism, as they missed the mark during the presidential election. \nA number of big pollsters have also opted not to cover the run-off races."

As the vessel attempted to leave the scene, one of the [boats] aggressively swerved in front of the Farley Mowat, crashing directly into the hull\" and splitting in two, it said. \nThe group said it provided emergency first aid to the two men who had been on board the fishing boat.\nConservationists working for Sea Shepherd have been attacked several times while patrolling the vaquita refuge.\nThe group works with Mexican authorities to remove illegal gillnets used to catch totoaba fish, which are highly valued in Chinese traditional medicine. The nets are designed to trap the heads of fish but not their bodies, but are blamed for trapping and killing the endangered porpoises as well."

      "text": "An order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home - to stop the spread of Covid-19 - will become legally enforceable from Friday.\nThe executive agreed the move after it met on Tuesday and tightened other measures.\nIt will mean people can only leave home for medical or food needs, exercise and work that cannot be done from home.\nNI is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed.\nMinisters also agreed to a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to reintroduce enforcement powers for the PSNI to order people to go home if they are engaging in prohibited activity.\nSpeaking after the meeting, First Minister Arlene Foster said people should not wait for the regulations to take effect and insisted people should already be staying at home.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland faced a \"difficult period ahead\", but that the interventions were necessary.\nHowever, she said the executive had not reached agreement on whether GCSE or A-level exams should go ahead, and that further meetings would need to take place later this week.\n\"We will also have an urgent meeting convened tomorrow with faith groups, hopefully moving them all to online services,\" she added.\nIndoor and outdoor gatherings will be reduced from 15 people to six and only from two households, which will include children under 12 - exemptions will apply such as support bubbles.\nPeople will no longer be allowed to meet with other households in private gardens, although similar exemptions will apply there too. \nHowever, people will be allowed to take exercise outdoors with one person from another household. \nThe executive also supported a proposal from the health minister to make it a requirement for all employers to conduct a risk assessment where employees are required to work away from their home. \nMinisters agreed the measures will last until 6 February, and be reviewed along with other lockdown measures on 21 January.\nMany pupils will not return to school until after the half-term break in mid-February, with nursery, primary and post-primary schools carrying out remote learning until then.\nHowever, ministers agreed that special schools will remain open as usual.\nVulnerable children and children of key workers will have access to schools for supervised learning. \nChildcare settings will be allowed to remain open and childminders can continue their services.\nPayments to parents of children who receive free school meals will also continue, the Department of Education has confirmed.\nDiscussions on exams took place, but ministers agreed to revisit this issue.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir said: \"Work is ongoing on this issue as a matter of urgency and I intend to provide further clarity in the next couple of days. \n\"Until and unless any announcement is made, students should expect to continue to sit scheduled examinations.\"\nOn Tuesday evening, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said \"further flexibilities\" would be put in place for January exams and assessments, particularly in relation to BTecs. \nShe said: \"Learning centres, including further education colleges, schools and training providers, will be afforded additional discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for learners to sit the scheduled BTec exams in January, taking into consideration a range of factors including health and safety and the personal circumstances of their learners.\"\nIt has also been confirmed that post-primary school transfer tests have been cancelled this month due to the surge in the number of coronavirus cases.\nThe first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, was due to take place on Saturday.\nBut the Association for Quality Education (AQE) later announced that a single transfer test would be held on Saturday 27 February.\nThe guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable - and had to shield during the first lockdown in March - is not expected to change.\nMinisters are due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, a further 18 coronavirus-related deaths - 11 in the past 24 hours and seven in the past week - were recorded by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 1,384. \nThe department recorded a further 1,378 cases of the virus, with 577 confirmed patients in hospital, 45 of whom are in intensive care. \nMore than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the previous week.\nNorthern Ireland's director of the Royal College of Surgeons warned the health service could soon struggle to deal with the number of people needing treatment.\n\"That's not just the Covid patients - it's the patients who have a heart attack, a stroke, the people who fall and break their hip,\" said Dr Mark Taylor.\n\"But the difficulty is the more the system is pulled to deal with Covid, the less ability we have to deal with other aspects.\n\"The more Covid overwhelms the intensive care units then we're into really difficult ethical decisions... which no doctor wants to make in terms of who requires that ventilator.\""

They do of course have to abide by public health advice, but they are private organisations and they will make their own announcements.\"\nThe Irish government is considering a proposal to close schools for the rest of January.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health reported that a further 1,801 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.\nThere have also been 12 more Covid-19 related deaths.\nThese latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,366, while 79,873 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic started.\nMore than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the week before.\nThe seven-day rate per 100,000 people is now 660 positive cases, compared to 200 per 100,000 two weeks ago.\nIn the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already  announced a fresh lockdown there from midnight, with schools closed until February.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Dr Michael McBride said Scotland's measures were \"prudent and sensible\".\nMeanwhile, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout has begun in Northern Ireland. \nUp to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the this week, with some of the first doses delivered at a GP surgery on the Falls Road in West Belfast on Monday afternoon.\nThe SDLP has called for the assembly to be recalled on Tuesday to discuss the rolling out of the vaccine.\nIt can be recalled if at least 30 MLAs sign a petition.\nOn Monday, Justice Minister Naomi Long welcomed the opening of Northern Ireland's first Nightingale venue, which will be used for courts and tribunals business.\nThe facility was approved by a meeting of the executive on 17 December, and will sit in the International Convention Centre in Belfast (ICC). \nActivity at the centre will be phased in, in line with Covid-19 regulations. \nIn other coronavirus-related developments on Monday:"

      "title": "Covid: Can we really jab our way out of lockdown?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "With the country in lockdown and a new faster-spreading variant of coronavirus rampant, it's clear the UK is in a race to vaccinate. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson wants all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers to be offered a jab by mid-February, to allow the restrictions to be eased. \nThat requires about 13 million people to be given the opportunity to be vaccinated - but so far only one million have been.\nAnd ensuring a quick rollout to the rest is fraught with difficulties. \nThere is enough vaccine in the country, BBC News has learned, but getting it into people's arms could be hampered by:\nTwo Covid vaccines have now been approved - one produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and another made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\nThe UK government has ordered 140 million doses - enough for the whole population. \nThe first hurdle is manufacture of the vaccine. \nThis involves two crucial stages - the production of the substance and then a process called fill and finish whereby the vaccine is put into vials and packaged up for use.\nAnd there is already a concern about the latter stage, with the availability of key ingredients and equipment including glass vials a key issue. \nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says fill and finish was a \"critically short resource across the globe\".\nThat is part of the reason why the amount of the two vaccines ready to go is more limited than ministers had hoped. \nUK plants have made somewhere around 15 million or so doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - that in itself is less than ministers said would be made at this stage (early in the pandemic they said there would be 30 million by the autumn).\nBut only four million have been through the fill-and-finish process. \nThe UK has used plants in Germany and the Netherlands to do some of this for the early batches.\nBut the government has also invested in a plant in Wrexham to ensure there is domestic capacity.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, meanwhile, is made outside of the UK - it comes from a plant in Belgium. \nWhen it arrives in the UK, it has already been placed into vials.\nBut so far, fewer than five million doses have been delivered - less than half the number that should have been - because of problems with manufacture, including the fill-and-finish process.\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said it had been monitoring the supply chain for \"some time\" and was confident the arrangements in place for the supply and onward deployment of vaccines were sufficient.\nEven once a vaccine is in the vials though, there is still one more step before the NHS can start using it. \nEach batch has to be checked and certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory Agency.\nAnd it can be several weeks before the vaccine can be given to the NHS to put in people's arms.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called this a \"rate-limiting factor\".\nAbout four million doses of the Oxford vaccine have been available for some weeks - they were put into vials last year - but as yet only just over 500,000 have been certified as safe to use.\nSources close to the NHS vaccination programme said this had been one of the key frustrations - saying it was taking up to 20 days for batches to be tested and released.\nThe MHRA said each batch had to be biologically tested for quality, while the manufacturer's documentation describing its production and quality-control testing process was reviewed.\nThose close to the process say it does take a couple of weeks - and with more vaccine being produced, there is increased demand on the labs that do the work.\n\"You have to remember this is being injected into people,\" they said. \"We cannot rush this.\"\nBoth vaccines have to go through this process.\nOnce batches have been certified, they are ready to be distributed to the NHS vaccination centres.\nEventually, there will be a network of more than 1,000 local centres across the UK.\nCurrently, just over 700 are up and running. \nThese are being run from a wide variety of venues, from hospitals and large GP centres to community venues, racecourses and, perhaps in the future, conference centres and sports stadiums.\nThe instability of the Pfizer-BioNTech has been well documented. \nIt has to be kept in ultra-cold storage and, once thawed, used within five days.\nThis has meant it is stored at major hospitals and gives the local vaccination centres just days to use up batches after they are delivered.\nThe Oxford vaccine, meanwhile, can be stored at fridge temperature, which makes it easier to distribute.\nBut even once they are at these vaccination centres, delivery of both vaccines is dependent on having the right numbers of staff available.\nCurrently, GPs, nurses, healthcare assistants and pharmacists are giving the vaccines. \nBut as the vaccination campaign ramps up, these will need to be supplemented by additional vaccinators.\nProvision has been made to train other health professionals, from physiotherapists and dentists to dieticians.\nBut there are reports an \"overload of bureaucracy\" - including mandatory courses in fire safety and preventing radicalisation - is slowing down this training.\nMinisters have said they will try to reduce the bureaucracy - amid warnings by the National Audit Office an army of nearly 50,000 vaccinators will be needed.\nAlthough at the moment, there are thought to be enough staff to cope with the limited amount of vaccines available.\nBritish Medical Association GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey said: \"We will need support eventually but not now. \n\"At the moment, the biggest issue is the NHS having enough supply of the vaccine to give.\"\nNearly a million doses have been given since people started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in early December, which puts the UK third globally in the most vaccinations done per head.\nAnd with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being used from this week, the NHS is hoping to double that number in the next seven days.\nGovernment sources said there would be disappointment if it did not reach two million doses a week by late January.\nThat - and a little bit more - will be needed to hit the mid-February target.\nBut even then, and assuming most people in these priority groups have come forward, the impact would not be immediate. \nIt takes a few weeks for the immune response to kick in.\nSo it would be early March before the full impact of the vaccination of these priority groups is felt.\nThen, however, it could have a significant effect.\nClose to nine in 10 Covid deaths have been in these priority groups.\nThey will have had only one dose, which, for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, is effective at preventing 70% of infections.\nBut the evidence suggests this will be enough to stop serious illness.\nSo if all goes to plan, the pathway to significantly easing restrictions comes into view.\nBut the complex nature of the supply chain coupled with the complexity of delivering vaccines to large numbers of people means it will take just one thing to go wrong to cause serious problems getting the UK out of this lockdown in the timeframe hoped."

      "text": "Scotland hopes to accelerate its vaccine rollout programme if supplies of the jab allow it to do so, the country's first minister has said.\nThe Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinate everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. \nIf the target is achieved, it would mean 2.7 million people - about half of the population - will have had the jab.\nIt would then be rolled out to the rest of the adult population. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon said that timetable was a \"cautious prediction\", and the aim was to accelerate the rollout \"as fast as we possibly can\" as more details about supply became available. \nMs Sturgeon was speaking as new lockdowns began in both Scotland and England, with people being told to stay at home except for a handful of permitted reasons. \nThe tough restrictions will remain in force across all of mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha until at least the end of the month, and will see schools closed to most pupils, places of worship shut and group exercise banned. \nSpeaking to the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said it was difficult to be definitive about when the restrictions would be lifted.\nBut she said it might be possible to ease some of the rules if the vaccination programme managed to push ahead of the virus in the \"race\" over the coming months.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"Lockdown is about trying to slow down the virus and push rates of it back down.\n\"Now, if we manage to do that, then hopefully we will be able to start lifting some of these restrictions while the vaccination programme is ongoing, even in that first phase of it.\n\"But I can't be certain about that yet, because it's dependent on us managing to get the levels of infection down.\"\nScotland hopes to have received just over 900,000 doses of the vaccine by the end of January - including the 100,000 doses that have already been administered to people. \nMs Sturgeon said the government did not yet have full certainty about supply schedules after this month, but said details were being firmed up all the time.\nAnd she said a \"cautious prediction\" would be that \"we will have vaccinated the whole of the JCVI priority list by early May, which is everybody in Scotland above the age of 50 and people under 50 with underlying health conditions. \n\"That is about 2.7 million people, and we will then go on to the rest of the population.\n\"But we will be working as information on supplies becomes clearer to accelerate that timetable as fast as we possibly can.\"\nThe NHS in England has said it hopes to be able to deliver two million vaccines a week by the end of this month.\nAnd Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to vaccinate people in the top four priority groups in England by mid-February - which would include everyone over the age of 70 and the most clinically vulnerable, as well as care home staff and residents and frontline health and social care workers.\nMs Sturgeon later told her daily briefing that said she would ideally want to do the same, but that she did not yet have enough certainty about the supply of the vaccine to be able to make a firm commitment.\nShe said this could risk \"undermining people's confidence in our ability to deliver\" if it was not possible to meet the timetable.\nOpposition parties have called on the Scottish government to publish daily vaccination figures so that the public can clearly see what progress is being made in the fight against Covid-19.\nA further 2,529 new coronavirus cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours, about half of which are thought to be the new variant. \nThe number of hospital patients confirmed to have coronavirus has also risen steeply to 1,347, an increase of 255 over the past week.\nOf these patients, 93 are in intensive care, an increase of 28 in the same period, while a further 11 deaths of people who had tested positive have been recorded. \nThe first minister also said she hoped the situation would have improved enough to allow pupils to return  to school on 1 February, but admitted that she cannot be certain that this will happen.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have warned that the attainment gap between richer and poorer pupils is poised to stretch even wider unless the Scottish government radically increase their support for learning at home.\nThe party says the government has had months to prepare for a return to remote learning, but that schools still do not have the necessary guidance and resources they need to provide equal access to high quality education. \nThe Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, has also warned that closing schools poses a \"serious risk of harm to the wellbeing of children and young people\" and online learning is being provided \"inconsistently\" across Scotland.\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the closure of schools had left working parents in a very difficult position. \nMs Sturgeon said plans were being developed to extend testing for the virus in schools, but said it would be \"wrong\" to divert vaccine doses away from the most vulnerable people so they could be given to teachers instead. \nMs Sturgeon added: \"We are trying to work out, within the overall programme, how quickly can we prioritise getting teachers and school staff vaccinated, so we have some discussions and some thinking still to do around that.\"\nShe also said she could see no reason why the Scottish Parliament election would not go ahead in May, adding that it was \"really important\" that the democratic process continues. \nMSPs passed legislation last month which contains contingency options for the election.\nIt could allow voting to take place on more than one day, though ministers do not expect this power will have to be used.\nA legally-enforceable stay-at-home order is now in place across mainland Scotland and Skye with people only permitted to leave their home for an \"essential purpose\".\nThis includes essential shopping, exercise, caring for someone, or if you are part of an extended household.\nAnyone able to work from home must do so, although those shielding to protect themselves from Covid-19 should not go into work - even if they cannot work from home.\nSchools will be closed to most pupils until 1 February at the earliest, meaning an additional two weeks of home learning for youngsters, in a move welcomed by teaching unions on Monday.\nMs Sturgeon also revised the numbers of those allowed to gather outside to just two people from two different households, instead of the previous limit of six people from two households.\nHowever children aged 11 and under are not included in this limit and can still \"play outdoors in larger groups, including in organised gatherings\".\nFrom Friday, places of worship must close but can open to broadcast a service or conduct a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.\nA maximum of 20 people can attend a funeral service but wakes are banned, while up to five people can attend weddings and civil partnership services.\nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone also confirmed there will be \"increased patrols\" in Scotland's communities and said and officers will continue to act against anyone making \"wilful breaches\" of the law.\nShetland, Orkney, Western Isles and several other islands currently remain at level three restrictions."

      "text": "Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it saw a shift in shoppers' behaviour in the run-up to Christmas as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.\nIt said that customers started shopping early to secure their festive treats, with traditional Christmas goods in strong demand. \nChampagne sales jumped 64% over the key Christmas trading period, while sales of whole salmon increased by 40%.\nMorrisons also said it would offer its car parks to host vaccination centres.\nThe supermarket's chief executive, David Potts, saidthree of its supermarket car parks would be hosting coronavirus vaccinations from Monday, and it would offer another 47 locations to help with the vaccine rollout.\nOverall sales at Morrisons rose by 9.3% in the three weeks to 3 January, compared with the same period last year.\n\"The pandemic has had a severe effect on people and communities around Britain for nine months now but it has been especially hard at Christmas time,\" Mr Potts said.\n\"I'm very pleased with the way the Morrisons team has helped our customers across the nation enjoy their Christmas in the best way they could.\"\nThe supermarket also suggested that festive sales had been driven by the fact that rules around larger family gatherings changed in England, meaning customers had to buy for last-minute smaller festivities.\nIn the nine weeks to 3 January, like-for-like sales, stripping out the effect of new shops opening and fuel sales, were up 8.5% and in the six months to the same date they rose 8.1% compared with a year ago, boosted by strong online sales and that of its wholesale business.\nMorrisons said it had also benefitted from out-of-home eating and drinking being restricted by strict Covid-19 regulations.\nSupermarkets were classified as essential retailers in England's second national lockdown between 5 November and 2 December, while restaurants and cafes could only operate takeaway services.\nAccording to new figures from market research firm Kantar, British people forked out \u00a311.7bn in supermarkets throughout December in the sector's busiest month on record.\nSupermarket trading was boosted by the \u00a34bn that would normally have been spent on food and drink outside the home over the Christmas season, it said.\n\"While celebrations may have been more low key, there were also signs of consumers keeping merry and indulging after a tough year\", said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.\nCheese sales, for example, increased by 17% and chilled desserts by 15%. Meanwhile, alcohol sales rose by \u00a3310m, with options to drink in pubs, bars and restaurants limited.\nThe firm also found that online grocery sales accounted for 12.6% of total spend in December, compared with 7.4% in 2019.\nDecember is always busy for the supermarkets but this one has been the busiest on record. \nWith all the restrictions and the closure of pubs and restaurants across much of the UK, people have had to eat and drink at home instead. According to Kantar, we spent \u00a312bn last month, the highest amount of groceries sales ever. \nIt's been a Christmas like no other but it seems we were determined to enjoy it. Aldi reported exceptional demand for its premium products yesterday. Morrisons says champagne sales were up 64% on last year. \nAll the supermarkets will be toasting bumper festive sales this year and with another national lockdown in place, they're set to enjoy continuing increased demand for another few months. \nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Morrisons' trading update marked a \"significant milestone\" for the supermarket chain.\n\"Morrisons is an underdog in some ways, especially when looking at the online business, which is smaller than some rivals. \n\"The pandemic has given the group a chance to address this, and digital sales have more than tripled so far this quarter.\n\"The question now is if Morrisons can keep a firm grasp on that momentum, and push growth long and hard enough to give its competitors something to worry about,\" she added.\nSeparately, clothing and homeware retailer Next reported a big uplift in online sales over the festive period.\nOnline sales saw a jump of 36% in the nine weeks to 26 December compared with the same period last year, off-setting the 43% fall seen in stores. \nAs a result, sales were 1.1% lower overall. The retailer said shoppers had shunned party outfits and work clothes in favour of loungewear.\nNext boss Simon Wolfson said that profits from better-than-expected sales in November and December would, however, be wiped out by fresh lockdown restrictions in England that would force 90% of its stores to close.\nIt also has to account for additional costs stemming from disruption to its traditional Boxing Day sale and clearing stock leftover in its shops.\nDespite lockdown restrictions, Next is \"likely to flourish as we emerge from this pandemic\", said Julie Palmer, a partner at the financial consultant Begbies Traynor.\nShe added that the recent administrations of the Arcadia Group and Debenhams might drive more shoppers to the retailer, as they turn to other familiar British brands.\n\"However, with no assurances of how long social distancing measures will be implemented and consumers now shopping for a purpose, not a pastime, the business must continue to manage costs and innovate if it is to take full advantage of these opportunities.\""

The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else.\nHowever, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to \"think particularly carefully\" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including:\nThere is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlthough Scotland moves to Covid protection level zero on 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said keeping the mandatory use of face coverings past then would give \"added protection and assurance\" to people who were particularly vulnerable.\nFrom 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace.\nHowever, companies still have legally binding health and safety responsibilities - and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. \nSome firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) is available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. \nYou may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons.\nRead the updated government advice.\nAlthough the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it \"expects and recommends\" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport.\nYou should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. \nThe NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to offer support.\nData shows Covid vaccines are highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection.\nBeing double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. \nYou should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not, book through the NHS website or call 119.\nThe most vulnerable people are likely to be offered booster jabs from September, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. \nYou are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.\nThe pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The government recommends several support websites.\nIf you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on the NHS Shielded Patient List. \nA combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk, including: \nHigh risk categories include people: "

      "text": "Scots are to be ordered to stay at home amid a fresh Covid-19 lockdown which will see schools remain closed to pupils until February.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new curbs would be introduced at midnight in a bid to contain the new, faster-spreading strain of the virus.\nNew laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible.\nOutdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household.\nPlaces of worship are to be closed, group exercise banned, and schools will largely operate via online and remote learning.\nThese rules will apply across the Scottish mainland until at least the end of January, and will be kept under review.\nIsland areas will remain in level three - but Ms Sturgeon said they would be monitored carefully.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later announced similar lockdown measures for the whole of England with all schools and colleges closing to most pupils until mid February.\nA further 1,905 new cases were reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said \"illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation\".\nThe first minister said she was \"more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year\", with the new coronavirus strain now accounting for half of new cases.\nAnd she said a \"steeply rising trend of infections\" was threatening to put \"significant pressure\" on NHS services, saying hospitals could breach capacity within three to four weeks.\nThe new rules - which will be put down in law - mean Scots will only be allowed to leave home for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine, exercise and caring responsibilities.\nNo limit is to be put on how many times people can go out to exercise, but outdoor meetings are to be limited to a maximum of two people from two households.\nEveryone who can work from home will be required to, and people in the \"shielding\" category are advised not to go in to work at all.\nThe construction and manufacturing industries will remain open, but Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review.\nPlaces of worship are to close, the number of people who can attend weddings is to be cut to five, and funeral wakes will no longer be allowed.\nSchools are to remain closed to the majority of pupils until February, with Ms Sturgeon saying community transmission of the virus must be brought to a lower level amid concerns that the new variant of the virus spreads more easily among young people.\nShe said she knew remote learning presented \"significant challenges\" for parents, teachers and pupils, adding: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils are quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"\nThe first minister said she was considering whether teachers could be given the Covid-19 vaccine as a priority.\nMore than 100,000 people have been given a first dose of the vaccine in Scotland, and the government expects to have access to just over 900,000 doses by the end of January.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said the best way to get schools open again was to drive down transmission of the virus - urging Scots to abide by the rules.\nThese are the toughest restrictions Scotland has faced since the lockdown of March 2020. \nIt is - once again - becoming compulsory to stay at home except for essential purposes like food shopping, exercise and medical care. \nThe extended closure of schools to most pupils is something the Scottish government was particularly keen to avoid. \nThese decisions are a measure of how worried ministers are about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is fast becoming the dominant strain. \nWith 225 cases per 100,000 people, Scotland is thought to be about four weeks behind London, which already has four times as many cases and NHS services under considerable pressure. \nThe Scottish government believes that without further action the NHS here would run out of beds for Covid patients within a month. \nThis new alert comes at the start of a new year which also brings new hope for a route out of the pandemic with two vaccines now beginning to offer protection. \nAround 100,000 doses have already been administered in Scotland but it is likely to take several months to reach all in the most vulnerable groups.\nThe first minister said Scotland was now in \"a race between the vaccine and the virus\".\nShe said: \"The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine. But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.\n\"We can already see - by looking at infection rates in the south of England - some of what could happen here in Scotland. To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.\n\"For government, that means introducing tough measures - as we have done today. And for all of us, it means sticking to the rules.\"\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson raised concerns about online learning, saying it was vital that pupils had \"equal access to high-quality education\".\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers and working parents would need support to make the remote learning system work.\nMs Sturgeon said her government had \"agonised\" over the decision on schools, and said the \"fundamental priority\" was to re-open them in full as soon as possible.\nShe said: \"Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.\"\nThe NHS has coped so far in Scotland - more so than many other parts of the UK. \nBut in places like Glasgow and Lanarkshire it has been very, very tight. And here like everywhere else staff are bracing themselves for the post-Christmas effects of rising cases. \nThe first minister gave some stark figures on hospital and ICU occupancy - suggesting we are just weeks away from reaching limits. \nThere is so little give in the system they will be glad to see everything possible done to prevent stretched services being overwhelmed at a time when we are on our way to getting out the other side. \nThere is real anxiety about what the next few weeks might bring."

And there has to be the other side of that contract,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"Everybody needs to try and make this work. And that includes the companies that can take away the charging for data. It's a serious situation.\"\nWhen questioned about the topic at a Downing Street press conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We are looking at... the potential costs to parents of online teaching, and we're going to do our best to support them in any way that we can and to work with the internet companies.\"\nThere is concern that some disadvantaged pupils are currently dependent on pay-as-you-go or monthly mobile phone subscriptions that only include a small data allowance because their families cannot afford or otherwise obtain a separate fixed broadband connection.\n\"There are 25 million pay-as-you go customers in the UK, and about seven million of those struggle with the cost of topping up their data,\" commented Chris Thorpe from the Centre For The Acceleration Of Social Technology charity.\nMany schools are using video-chat software including Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet to live-stream classes, assemblies and other activities, which all benefit from a fast, stable connection and can consume a lot of data.\nIn addition, other tools including Google Classroom, Tapestry and Class Dojo are used by pupils to submit schoolwork and receive marks and other feedback.\nThe situation became more pressing after the prime minister announced last night that England's lockdown would mean schools and colleges would remain closed to most pupils until at least the February half-term.\nTech for UK - a coalition of technologists and other concerned business leaders - has suggested one way forward would be for internet providers to \"zero rate\" edtech apps and websites, so that their data use would be deducted from a mobile subscriber's monthly allowance.\nHowever, it acknowledges the challenge in doing so is to pick which platforms to support without giving some providers an unfair advantage over others.\nThe Department for Education already runs a scheme for disadvantaged children who do not have access to a home broadband connection to temporarily increase their mobile data allowance. \nIn some cases, this involves an extra 20 gigabytes a month. In others - such as Three - it provides an \"unlimited\" data upgrade.\nSchools, trusts and local authorities need to request the support on a pupil's behalf.\nThe networks involved in the initiative include:\nIn cases when this is not available, the government offers 4G wireless routers - which use mobile networks to offer a wi-fi connection - as an alternative.\nIn addition, Vodafone provided 350,000 \"free data\" Sim cards to thousands of primary and secondary schools and colleges in November.\n\"We are actively considering what to do now about this new situation,\" it said.\nO2 pledged in October to donate 10,000 devices and 12 months of free data to \"vulnerable individuals\".\nAnd Virgin Media noted it had launched a discounted home broadband service for families facing financial difficulties and receiving universal credit.\nBT says it has already removed all caps on its home broadband plans to help ensure children can stay connected to their schools.\nAnne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, said she was also concerned about the provision of devices.\n\"A lot of children still don't have laptops. They're surviving on broken phones,\" she told the Today programme.\nThe Department for Education said it had delivered more than 560,000 devices to schools and councils in England between the start of the pandemic and the end of last year.\nIn addition, it aims to have delivered a further 100,000 laptops and tablets to schools by the end of this week to help get closer to its overall target of one million devices.\nHowever, teaching groups have raised concerns about the rollout.\n\"We must hear no more of rationing of equipment, as we did late last year,\" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) told the BBC.\n\"If the stockpiles exist, as the Department for Education claim they do, then they must be distributed urgently. We have heard too many stories of requests from schools not being met, or not being fully met.\"\nSteven George of head teachers' union, NAHT added that a website used to order laptops had been inaccessible over the Christmas break, so some members had been unable to make requests.\nIn addition, the Association of School and College Leaders suggested the government had \"never really got to grips\" with the issue.\n\"It is certainly sending out lots of laptops for disadvantaged children to schools. But there's clearly still a gap, not just in terms of the number of devices that are required but also in terms of whether families have sufficient connectivity,\" said general secretary Geoff Barton. \n\"This has happened because it is a crisis situation, and there hasn't been a great deal of time in which to properly assess the level of need that exists, but it does expose the fact that pre-crisis, there hadn't been a properly joined-up national strategy on digital learning.\"\nOthers have noted that the device allocation scheme does not extend to printers - which are needed for worksheets and other materials sent by teachers - putting low-income families at a further disadvantage."

The force did not appeal.\nWelsh company Credas said laws were not keeping up with the latest technology.\nThe Home Office said it wants police to use new crime-reducing technology while \"maintaining public trust\". \nCredas believes such facial recognition technology could be a vital tool in fighting crime.\n\"Ten years ago it would have felt space age, but now it's everywhere - just logging into my phone or laptop, we're all used to it now,\" said chief executive Rhys David.\n\"But the legislation will never keep up with the technological advancements.\"\nThe firm, based in Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan, works with firms to prevent crime in commercial settings, helping them confirm a client's identity.\nIt can include estate agents, the legal sector, accountancy or gambling operations - any businesses regulated to reduce fraud and money laundering. \n\"There's common stories of people buying houses with someone else's identity and manipulating the paperwork so that the funds get transferred into the wrong account and it's too late then - we can't recover that,\" said Mr David.\n\"It's a very difficult position to be in, but technologies like ours are closing the gap.\"\nCredas's app uses facial recognition - people take a selfie and the app compares it to a photograph of their passport to verify they are who they claim to be. \nClaire Williams works for FBM estate agent in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, which has been using the software for the past two years.\n\"Before we would take people's passports or driver's licence, they would either come into the office and we would photocopy it, or we would even accept a scanned, emailed copy. \n\"There would be no way of knowing whether these were legitimate passports and driver's licences. \n\"They might have been using fake IDs, trying to launder money through the property industry - putting money into the properties, then reselling them to launder the money.\"\nBut scanning faces to confirm details for a mortgage is a very different beast to automated facial recognition, which is what was being trialled by South Wales Police - scanning faces in a crowd, often without people's knowledge.\nThat was ruled unlawful after a challenge by civil rights group Liberty and Ed Bridges from Cardiff. \n\"Real-time surveillance is considerably more complex than in the commercial space where it's a fairly static, controlled environment. But we should be adopting it and encouraging it to reduce a criminal footprint,\" added Mr David.\n\"I find it really sad that the police aren't encouraged to use technology like this to keep our country safe. \n\"Let's be honest, the police don't want to sell us trainers. They're not looking to capture our images or biometric footprints to sell us goods. It's to keep us safe, so the police can run very sophisticated facial matching programmes in real time to identify criminals.\" \nThe frustration was echoed by the surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, who is the independent regulator appointed to oversee the use of camera systems in England and Wales.\nFollowing the appeal court ruling on South Wales Police in August, he said he had been \"fruitlessly and repeatedly\" calling for an updated code the police could follow. \nWhile campaigners Liberty felt the court's ruling left little room for the technology to be safely used, Mr Porter disagreed, adding: \"I believe adoption of new and advancing technologies is an important element of keeping citizens safe.\"  \nHe has issued new guidance on the use of facial recognition in light of the case, but it remains just that - guidance, not law.\nIt has left police forces still trying to iron out the problems raised by the Court of Appeal - the potential for gender and ethnic biases and a robust code to cover when, how and where the technology can be used, and in search of whom. \nProf Martin Innes, from the Universities' Police Sciences Institute, evaluated the rollout of automatic facial recognition for South Wales Police in 2018, flagging ethical and regulatory challenges facing forces.\n\"If you look back at the history of new and innovative technologies in policing this is what always happens. You have to let the law catch up a little bit and find out what matters and where the key points of regulation are,\" he said.\nAt present, different standards between the private and public sectors \"could be very, very confusing,\" he added.\n\"There is a risk that these technologies get introduced almost by stealth and they start popping up everywhere.\" \nIn a way, some of that has already happened, from mobile phones that can detect your face to hi-tech doorbells\nStopping criminal harm \"seems to be an equally justifiable reason\" to use the technology, argued Prof Innes.\n\"But we need to think quite carefully about how far do we want this to go, and where is it appropriate for us to introduce these technologies in our lives.  \n\"There are issues - but there are potentially opportunities and benefits to be gained if it can be done in the right way, as well.\"\nThe Home Office and the police say they will consider any ideas that could improve the way live facial recognition technology is used.\n\"We want police to use new technologies, like live facial recognition, in a way that reduces crime while maintaining public trust,\" said a Home Office spokesperson.\n\"We are working closely with the police to ensure national College of Policing guidance complies with the Court of Appeal's request to clarify how live facial recognition will be used.\n\"The government committed in the Home Office Biometrics Strategy to review the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice and it will be updated in due course.\""

      "text": "Some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month, MPs have been told.\nEvents are \"rapidly approaching the determination point\", after which they'll have to pull the plug, said the Association of Independent Festivals.\nOrganisers will be in \"absolutely dire straits\" financially if the season is cancelled, added Anna Wade, of Winchester's Boomtown Fair.\nThey were speaking to MPs examining the plight of music festivals in the UK.\nThe House of Commons culture select committee is carrying out an inquiry into the viability of this summer's events, after the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the 2020 festival season.\nTuesday's hearing came a day after Glastonbury festival organiser Emily Eavis assured fans they \"haven't cancelled\" the 2021 event.\nBut the committee was told that the government needs to introduce Covid cancellation insurance for live events and an extension to the current VAT cut on concert tickets.\n\"If the government don't help with insurance, then the smaller festivals are going to drop away,\" said Sacha Lord, co-founder of Manchester's Parklife Festival.\nHe added that vaccinations and mass testing were essential to ensure the future of live music.\n\"Social distancing does not work at any of these events,\" he told MPs. \"It's a festival. You just cannot put social distancing in place, so we are anticipating that we will be operating at 100% [capacity].\"\nWade pointed out that rapid-turnaround testing would place another financial burden on festival organisers. Testing kits are currently \u00a310 each, she said, potentially meaning an outlay of \u00a3660,000 for her 66,000 attendees.\nHowever, Lord, who is also night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, said he was optimistic that festivals would \"bounce back\" once the virus was under control.\n\"People want to go to a gig, whether it's a festival or a small grassroots venue,\" he said. \"The appetite is out there.\"\nSteve Heap, general secretary of the Association of Festival Organisers, said that while major festivals would have to make a decision this month, smaller events had until April.\n\"If we get as far as Easter and we still don't know that crowds can gather at festivals, however large or small, then we are in a catastrophic situation with this year's season,\" he said.\nThe UK live music industry was worth \u00a31.3bn in 2019 - but it has been hit hard by the pandemic, with more than 90% of the gigs planned for 2020 cancelled.\nBefore Tuesday's hearing, music industry trade body UK Music called on MPs to name a \"restart date\" after which gigs can go ahead.\nThe lack of coronavirus insurance was the \"biggest barrier\" to events resuming, it said, pointing out that Germany had recently announced a \u00a32.3bn event cancellation fund, in line with several other European countries.\nSuch a situation puts the UK at a \"competitive disadvantage\", UK Music's chief executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin warned.\n\"The real danger here is that, if we see a lot of countries - particularly in Europe and closer to home - protecting their festival seasons, you could almost have a talent transfer,\" he told the committee. \n\"We don't want to have a situation where musicians, crews, technicians - people who should be working in the UK festival scene - are looking to the continent and thinking, actually, if there's going to be live music happening there in 2021, that's where we're going to be going.\"\nUK Music's call to action came in a report called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running.\nIn a statement, Mr Njoku-Goodwin said that even with the roll-out of vaccines, \"lack of notice and available insurance options will mean much of the 2021 summer music season can't go ahead\".\nResponding to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it. \n\"Our \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than \u00a31bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Some EU specialist online retailers have said they will no longer deliver to the UK because of tax changes which came into force on 1 January.\nBicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits said from now on, it would ship to every country in the world except the UK.\n\"We are forced by British policy to stop dealing with British customers,\" it said on its website.\nAnother firm, Belgium-based Beer On Web, said it was now shunning the UK \"due to the new Brexit measures\".\nThe companies are angry because they now face higher costs and increased bureaucracy in order to comply with UK tax authorities. \nHowever, it is unclear how many have taken the drastic step of refusing all UK orders.\nAt the same time, international shipping companies including Federal Express and TNT have said they are levying additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU.\nThey said this reflected the increased investment they had had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.\nThe moves follow changes in VAT rules brought in by HM Revenue and Customs on 1 January.\nVAT is now being collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation.\nThis essentially means that overseas retailers sending goods to the UK are expected to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3135).\nA government spokesperson said: \"The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. \n\"The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale, raising an anticipated \u00a3300m every year.\n\"Many EU businesses which currently sell goods to UK customers will have already registered for UK VAT under existing rules and HMRC is working very closely with those who haven't to ensure they can comply with the changes.\"\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said consumers would be \"frustrated\" if the new VAT rules were applied in a way that causes significant inconvenience.\n\"It's vital the government makes it clear to consumers as well as traders what the changes as a result of Brexit mean for them and how they shop. It should also work to ensure UK consumers can retain access to a wide range of competitively priced and quality goods.\"\nCampaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, told the BBC that the massive increase in international online shopping had led to VAT evasion on a huge scale.\nHe said the new HMRC rules were aimed at tackling that, but it was unclear how firms who failed to register for UK VAT would be dealt with.\n\"Why should a phonograph spares manufacturer in Idaho bother to register for VAT in the UK and how are you going to make them do it?\" he said. \"And if they send the package anyway, what are you going to do?\"\n\"For providing this service, [HMRC] intend to charge a fee to every company in the world in every country in the world which exports to the UK,\" said Dutch Bike Bits on its website. \n\"Clearly this is ludicrous for one country, but imagine if every country in the world had the same idea. \n\"If every country decided to behave in the same way, then we would have to pay 195 fees every year, keep up with the changes in taxation law for 195 different countries, keep accounts on behalf of 195 different countries and submit payments to 195 tax offices in 195 different countries, and jump through whatever hoops were required to prove that we were doing all of this honestly and without any error.\"\nDutch Bike Bits said it had many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade with them. \n\"Not being able to send parcels to the UK does not work in any way in our favour and it is not what we wanted,\" the firm added.\n\"If you're angry about this, and you may well be so, please contact your elected representative in the UK.\"\nOther firms held out the hope that their ban on exports to the UK might prove to be temporary.\nScandinavian Outdoor, which is based in Finland and sells outdoor clothing and equipment, posted a message on its homepage saying: \"No delivery to UK just now.\"\nIn a further message explaining its decision, it said: \"Due to Brexit, we have temporarily closed our store from UK-based customers. Ordering will be possible as soon as our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out.\"\nMeanwhile, mail and freight company TNT has said it is now imposing a surcharge of \u00a34.31 on all shipments between the UK and the EU.\nTNT is now owned by Federal Express, which has also \"updated\" its charges, a spokesperson for the two companies said.\n\"FedEx/TNT has been making incremental investments to adjust our systems, processes, resourcing and customer-facing solutions to ensure readiness for the change on 1 January 2021,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"To reflect these investments and the incremental cost of customs clearance, we are increasing transportation rates for shipments from UK to EU, and EU to UK.\"\nRivals DHL and UPS have also taken similar measures."

      "text": "Tough new lockdown restrictions forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons have come into force across the Scottish mainland.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the clampdown was necessary to contain the spread of the new strain of Covid-19.\nPeople are now required by law to stay in their homes and to work from home.\nOutdoor gatherings have been restricted to one-on-one meet-ups, and schools will close to most pupils until February at the earliest. \nMs Sturgeon told MSPs on Monday that Scotland faced an \"extremely serious\" situation, with the new, faster-spreading variant of coronavirus \"a massive blow\".\nSchools will remain closed to most pupils until at least the beginning of February.\nThe first minister has said she cannot guarantee when children will be allowed back in classrooms or when the latest lockdown restrictions will be lifted.\nShe also told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Tuesday that she hoped 2.7 million people in Scotland would have received one dose of the Covid vaccine by the middle of May.\nShe said: \"I can't be definitive right now about when we will lift these restrictions.\n\"I have described this as a race - we've got the vaccine in one lane and we are trying to accelerate that.\n\"We've got the virus which has learned to run faster in the other lane and we've got to slow it down.\n\"Lockdown is about pushing rates of the virus back, and if we manage to do that then hopefully we will be able to start lifting restrictions while the vaccination programme is ongoing.\"\nA government document revealed there were now more than 90 patients in intensive care units, with new modelling suggesting that figure could more than double by early February.\nThe modelling sets out different scenarios with the most pessimistic predicting hospitals admissions could soar to more than 8,000 with over 700 patients requiring intensive care.\nThe document also revealed that Inverclyde - which a few weeks ago had relatively low levels of Covid - now has the highest case rate,  almost 550 per 100,000 - while Dumfries and Galloway has seen its rate increase to 475 per 100,000.\nDundee City, East Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and the Scottish Borders all now have case rates exceeding 300 per 100,000.\nOnly limited data was released by the government in recent days but a full update on deaths, hospital admissions and local infection rates has now been issued.\nThe new restrictions came into force at midnight and are, in effect, an enhancement to the level four curbs already in place across the mainland and Skye.\nThey will run until at least the end of January and could yet be extended both in scope and duration.\nScotland's island communities, with the exception of Skye, are to remain in level three for now, although Ms Sturgeon warned this would also remain under review.\nNew regulations mean Scots are prohibited from leaving their homes for anything other than \"essential\" purposes - although the law provides a lengthy list of examples of \"reasonable excuses\".\nThese include shopping for food or medical supplies, providing or accessing childcare, exercise, and participation in extended households.\nAnyone who can do their job from home must do so, and people in the \"shielding\" category have been advised not to go out to work at all.\nNew restrictions have been placed on outdoor gatherings in level four areas, with only two people from separate households now permitted to meet up. \nThese restrictions do not include children under the age of 12, who are still allowed to gather to play, but everyone else must abide by them or face a fixed penalty notice.\nTravel restrictions remain in place between local authority areas and in and out of Scotland, and people have been urged to stay as close to home as possible when going out for exercise.\nSchools will now operate on a remote-learning basis for the majority of pupils when the new term starts on 11 January, with only the children of key workers and vulnerable children to receive face-to-face teaching.\nThis is to run until at least 1 February, with a review on 18 January - with Ms Sturgeon saying her \"fundamental priority\" was still to get children back in school full time as quickly as possible.\nThe new measures are a bid to control the spread of the new variant of Covid, which is now thought to be responsible for nearly half of all new cases of the virus in Scotland.\nOfficials believe Scotland is roughly four weeks behind London - where health services are coming under increasing pressure - and warn that hospitals could hit capacity within the month without major new curbs.\nBetween 23 and 30 December, the average number of cases per 100,000 people in Scotland increased by 65%, from 136 to 225."

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has called for a \"round the clock\" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases.\nAs part of a televised speech, the Labour leader said the government needed to deliver \"millions of doses a week by the end of the month\". \nHe said there were \"serious questions for the government to answer\" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but Labour would support the restrictions.\nBoris Johnson said daily vaccination figures would be published from Monday.\nThe prime minister has also said the four most vulnerable groups of people across the UK should receive their first dose by mid-February. \nBoth the PM and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have announced lockdowns this week.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December.\nEngland's lockdown will become law from 00:01 GMT Wednesday and MPs will return to the Commons later that day to vote on the measures retrospectively. \nThe restrictions come into force as the number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nOn Tuesday, 60,914 had tested positive in the previous 24 hours and a further 830 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn an address to the nation on BBC One, in response to Boris Johnson's televised address on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK had reached a \"critical moment in our fight against coronavirus\".\nThe Labour leader said people were \"angry at the mistakes the government has made\" and ministers needed to answer questions on why they did not act sooner over locking down England. \nHe stressed that Labour would continue to hold the government to account, but added: \"Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together.\n\"At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives.\"\nSir Keir reiterated that Labour would support the new lockdown when it comes to the retrospective Commons vote on Wednesday and \"join in this national effort\".\nBut he called for the government to use the lockdown to establish \"a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme\" to \"deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery\".\nThe Labour leader added: \"This is now a race between the virus and the vaccine and if we pull together as a nation, we can win.\n\"We need a new contract between the government and the British people: The country stays at home, the government delivers the vaccine.\"\nEarlier at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said more than 1.3 million people across the UK had now been vaccinated with either the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.\nThe figure included 23% of over-80s in England - part of a programme Mr Johnson said aimed to save \"the most lives the fastest\".\nThe PM said there will \"still be long weeks ahead\", but that he wanted to give \"maximum possible transparency\" about the vaccination roll-out.\nMore details will be announced on Thursday, with daily updates starting on Monday, \"so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making\", he added.\nAsked whether the target could be met, Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said the timetable was \"realistic but not easy\"."

      "tags": "Julian Assange,Extradition,Wikileaks,United States",
      "text": "Wikileaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the United States, a court in London has ruled.\nThe judge blocked the request because of concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide in the US.\nMr Assange, who is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011, says the case is politically motivated. \nExpressing disappointment at the ruling, the US justice department noted that its legal arguments had prevailed.\nIts position is that the leaks broke the law and endangered lives. \n\"While we are extremely disappointed in the court's ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised,\" the justice department said.    \nThe US authorities have 14 days in which to lodge an appeal and are expected to do so. \nMr Assange will now be taken back to Belmarsh Prison - where he is being held - and a full application for his bail will be made on Wednesday. \nHis lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC told the court there would be evidence to show Mr Assange would not abscond. \nDistrict Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that while US prosecutors had met the tests for Mr Assange to be extradited for trial, the US was incapable of preventing him from attempting to take his own life.\nOutlining evidence of his self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she said: \"The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future.\"\nShe said: \"Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge.\"\nMr Assange, who wore a blue suit and green face mask in the dock, closed his eyes as the judge read out her ruling on Monday.\nHis fiancee Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept and was comforted by Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who sat next to her in court.\nSpeaking outside court after the ruling, she called on the US president to \"end this now\".\n\"Mr President, tear down these prison walls,\" she said. \"Let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all.\"\nDistrict Judge Vanessa Baraitser explicitly concluded that Mr Assange should answer allegations that he aided and abetted hacking, theft and the disclosure of the identities of informants working for the US security agencies - disclosures that endangered their lives. \nIn English law, that would be enough for him to be charged with a crime here - and so the route was open for Mr Assange to face trial for the same in the United States. \nBut British extradition law also requires a judge to consider Mr Assange's health. \nAnd it's the effect of his possible detention in near-solitary confinement in a \"supermax\" prison that proved decisive. \nThe US, in the judge's conclusion, can't stop a mentally unwell man taking his own life in those conditions. \nAnd so the legal requirement to treat Mr Assange humanely trumps the seriousness of the case that the judge acknowledges he should answer. \nWhen the US appeals - it'll have to convince more senior judges otherwise.\nIf convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years.\nMr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website.\nHe says the information exposed abuses by the US military. \nBut US prosecutors say the leaks of classified material endangered lives, and so the US sought his extradition from the UK.\nExtradition is the process under which one country can ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial.\nFollowing the judgement, several politicians and organisations welcomed the news, although some expressed dismay that the ruling was made on health grounds:\nMr Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\nHe sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012 until he was arrested in April 2019.\nAt the time he fled to the embassy, he had been facing extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault which he denied. That case was later dropped."

      "text": "Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers.\nThe British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. \nIt says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols.\nThese are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19.\nThis follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units.\nPublic Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updated in October 2020.\nEarly in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated.\nBut research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. \nMost infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. \nAcross the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. \nMore sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols.\nIn their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. \nBut they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. \nThe letter states: \"It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission\".\nBarry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. \nHe is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. \nA signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it.\n\"There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place.\"\nHe believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients.\nSurgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about \u00a35.00.  \nDr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid,\nHe points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. \n\"We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us.\"\nA few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance.\nIt's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. \nOne consultant, who did not want to be named, said: \"When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act.\"\nRCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: \"Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. \n\"While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases.\"\nPublic Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline.\n\"UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data.\n\"Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.\""

      "text": "Virgin Holidays has become the latest travel firm to cancel holidays after new coronavirus lockdown restrictions were imposed.\nIt said schedules will be cancelled until mid-February, joining similar moves by Tui, Jet2 and Thomas Cook.\nThe companies said customers would be contacted about their future travel options during what Virgin described as \"these extraordinary circumstances\".\nThomas Cook said it will call customers to offer refunds or rebooking. \nTui said it was \"cancelling all holidays in line with international travel restrictions\". It added that said customers due to depart from England, Scotland and Wales would be contacted to discuss options.\nThe company said that customers due to travel from an English airport before mid-February, or from a Scottish or Welsh airport up to 31 January, would not be able to do so.\nThose customers will be contacted \"in departure date order to discuss their options\", Tui said, which include rebooking \"with an incentive\", getting a credit note, or a full refund.\n\"Customers currently overseas can continue to enjoy their holidays as planned and we will update them directly if there are any changes to their holidays,\" Tui added.\nIn a statement, Virgin said: \"In line with the new national lockdown restrictions we have reviewed the upcoming holiday schedule and will be cancelling all holidays up to and including 14 February 2021. \n\"To simplify the options and to provide immediate peace of mind for customers whose holidays will no longer be going ahead, we're automatically providing a digital voucher for the value of their trip, redeemable up until 30 September 2021, which they can use to rebook a holiday, departing any time before 31 December 2022.\"\nVirgin added that customers \"may also request a refund\". \nMeanwhile, Jet2 said it was extending \"the suspension of flights and holidays up to and including 11 February 2021\".\nA spokesman said: \"For customers due to travel from 12th February onwards, we will provide another update closer to the time.\"\nThomas Cook, which became an online-only travel brand in September after its earlier collapse, said: \"Following the announcement of the latest lockdown, we are calling our customers to offer refunds or move their holidays to a later date.\".\nChief executive Alan French said: \"We've seen over the festive period that customers are looking ahead to the summer and beginning to book in earnest for those important summer weeks in the sun.\n\"I am sure that after many more weeks spent at home - and with the progress of the vaccine rollout - we will see an even bigger demand for people to escape to the beach this summer.\"\nLast month, a number of countries suspended routes to the UK due to the rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus.\nThe blanket travel ban to the EU was then lifted, but with rules varying from country to country. The suspension of flights between the UK and China remains in place.\nLast year Tui was investigated by competition authorities after complaints that it had not given prompt refunds.\nBritish Airways Holidays, part of Britain's biggest airline, said it would be offering refunds if customers are no longer allowed travel.\nThe firm said in a statement: \"We are contacting all affected British Airways Holidays customers following the announcement of new national lockdown restrictions. \n\"Customers due to depart by 12 February 2021 will be offered a refund for their holiday. Our teams continue to monitor the situation and update our policy accordingly.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The first Scottish recipients of the new Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine have received their jabs.\nJames Shaw, 82, and his 82-year-old wife Malita were among the first to be vaccinated in Dundee.\nThe couple received their first doses at Lochee Health and Community Care Centre.\nNicola Sturgeon has said she hoped all over-50s and those with underlying health conditions will have been vaccinated by early May.\nJames said: \"My wife and I are delighted to be receiving this vaccination. I have asthma and bronchitis and I have been desperate to have it so I am really pleased to be one of the first to be getting it. \n\"I know it takes a little while for the vaccine to work but after today I know that I will feel a bit less worried about going out. I will still be very careful and avoid busy places but knowing I have been vaccinated will really help me.\n\"All of my friends have said they are going to have the vaccine when it is their turn and I would encourage everyone who is offered this vaccination to take it.\"\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme is being rolled out less than a week after it was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It is the second vaccine approved for use in the UK.\nNHS Tayside is rolling out the vaccine through GP practices in the community and will also vaccinate elderly residents and staff in care homes.\nIts associate director of public health Dr Daniel Chandleris said: \"The efforts of our vaccination teams have been amazing and it is testament to a real whole team approach that sees the first over-80s in the general population have their jabs today in Tayside.\n\"The availability and mobility of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine gives us the opportunity to start to roll out the biggest vaccine programme that the UK has ever seen across our communities.\n\"Over-80s are the first priority group and patients will be contacted directly to attend a vaccination session.\"\nScottish Secretary Alister Jack added: \"This is another important moment in our fight against the virus - every vaccination takes us a step closer to getting back to our normal lives as soon as possible.\n\"As with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the UK is the first country in the world to approve and roll out the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with the UK Government ordering and paying for millions of doses for people in all parts of the UK.\"\nThe milestone came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new stricter lockdown. \nWith the exception of essential travel, people in mainland Scotland will have to remain at home from midnight.\nStatistics released on Monday showed a further 1,905 people had contracted Covid-19. \nFigures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday.\nMs Sturgeon likened the situation to a race between the vaccine and the virus.\nShe said: \"In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they run as fast as possible.\n\"But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new variant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks. \n\"To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible. But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.\"\nThe new vaccine will initially be available in the hospitals that have been delivering the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, and new community settings will be able to deliver the jabs from 11 January. \nPeople in Scotland will be contacted by their health board when it is their turn to be vaccinated. \nThe Oxford vaccination marks a major turning point in the pandemic and will lead to a massive expansion in the UK's immunisation campaign, with enough to vaccinate 50 million people throughout the UK already on order. \nIt is easier to transport and store than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which needs cold storage of about -70C.\nThe UK government has said 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available to the UK from Monday, with \"millions due by the beginning of February\". \nScotland will ultimately get an 8.2% share of these vaccines, based on its population. \nChief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith has said he expects the NHS in Scotland to receive 440,360 doses of the vaccine during January. \nThe first minister said on Monday about 100,000 people in Scotland have already received a first dose of vaccine.\nBoth vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks. \nPreviously the advice was for the vaccines to have a four-week gap between doses.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) then recommended as many people as possible in the top priority groups should be offered a first dose as the initial priority."

      "tags": "Singapore,Coronavirus pandemic,Privacy",
      "text": "Singapore has admitted data from its Covid contact tracing programme can also be accessed by police, reversing earlier privacy assurances. \nOfficials had previously explicitly ruled out the data would be used for anything other than the virus tracking. \nBut parliament was told on Monday it could also be used \"for the purpose of criminal investigation\".\nClose to 80% of residents are signed up to the TraceTogether programme, which is used to check in to locations.\nThe voluntary take up increased after it was announced it would soon be needed to access anything from the supermarket to your place of work.\nThe TraceTogether programme, which uses either a smartphone app or a bluetooth token, also monitors who you have been in contact with.\nIf someone tests positive with the virus, the data allows tracers to swiftly contact anyone that might have been infected. This prompted concerns over privacy - fears which have been echoed across the world as other countries rolled out their own tracing apps. \nTo encourage people to enrol, Singaporean authorities promised the data would never be used for any other purpose, saying \"the data will never be accessed, unless the user tests positive for Covid-19 and is contacted by the contact tracing team\".\nBut Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan told parliament on Monday that it can in fact also be used \"for the purpose of criminal investigation\", adding that \"otherwise, TraceTogether data is to be used only for contact tracing and for the purpose of fighting the Covid situation\".\nHowever, the privacy statement on the TraceTogether site was then updated on the same day to state that \"the Criminal Procedure Code applies to all data under Singapore's jurisdiction\".\n\"Also, we want to be transparent with you,\" the statement reads. \"TraceTogether data may be used in circumstances where citizen safety and security is or has been affected.\n\"The Singapore Police Force is empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to obtain any data, including TraceTogether data, for criminal investigations.\"\nOn Tuesday, the country's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, clarified that it was not just TraceTogether data that was used in cases of serious criminal investigations.\nHe said under the CPC, \"other forms of sensitive data like phone or banking records\" would also have their privacy regulations overruled in such cases.\nMr Balakrishnan added that to his knowledge, police had so far only once accessed contact tracing data, in the case of a murder investigation. \nThe minister stressed though that \"once the pandemic is over and there will no longer be a need for contact tracing, we will happily stand down the TraceTogether programme.\"\nMonday's announcement though sparked some controversy on social media, with people calling out the government and some users posting that they had now deleted the app. \n\"I'm disappointed, but not at all surprised,\" local journalist and activist Kirsten Han told the BBC. \"This is actually something that I've been flagging as a concern since the earlier days of TraceTogether - and was sometimes told that I was just a paranoid fearmonger undermining efforts to fight Covid-19.\n\"It doesn't feel good at all to discover I was right.\"\n\"I think why most people are so angry about this is not that they feel like they're constantly being watched,\" one Singaporean, who did not want to be named, told the BBC. \"We already have that through other means like CCTV. \n\"It's more that they feel like they've been cheated. The government had assured us many times that TraceTogether would only be used for contact tracing, but now they've suddenly added this new caveat.\"\nAnother person told the BBC they wished they could delete the app, but daily life would be impossible without it. \n\"So I'm just going to disable my Bluetooth for TraceTogether from now on, unless I have to use it to enter somewhere. If the app is not only going to be used for contact tracing, then it's too much of an invasion of privacy.\"\nAustralian privacy watchdog Digital Rights Watch, told the BBC they were \"extremely concerned\" about the news from Singapore.  \n\"This is the worst case scenario that privacy advocates have warned about since the start of the pandemic,\" Programme Director Lucie Krahulcova told the BBC. \"Such an approach will erode public trust in future health responses and therefore impede their efficacy.\"\nLike most countries, Australia has rolled out its own contact tracing app but uptake has been sluggish precisely because of privacy concerns. \nSingapore was among the first countries to introduce a contact tracing app nationally in March last year.\nThe introduction of the token in June had sparked a rare backlash against the government over concerns the device would be mandatory.  An online petition calling for it to be ditched has gathered some 55,000 signatures so far.\nSingapore has been been one of the most successful countries in tackling the pandemic. Despite a big outbreak among its foreign workers early on, local infection rates have for months been close to zero. "

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "text": "Stationery chain Paperchase is on the brink of administration after most of its stores were forced to close over the Christmas period.\nThe firm has filed a notice to appoint administrators, a move that will give it breathing space from its creditors while it works out a rescue plan. \nThe company has 127 stores and about 1,500 employees. \nThe second lockdown in November came at a crucial period for the firm, which makes a high proportion of sales then.\nJust under half its sales, 40%, come from trade in November and December. \nPaperchase said: \"The cumulative effects of lockdown one, lockdown two - at the start of the Christmas shopping period - and now the current restrictions have put unbearable strain on retail businesses across the country.\"\nThe company went through an insolvency process, known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement or CVA, almost two years ago to cut costs.\nThe chain now has 10 working days to find a solution. \nPaperchase said its strong online trading had not made it \"immune\" from the impact of shop closures across the country.\n\"Out of lockdown we've traded well, but as the country faces further restrictions for some months to come, we have to find a sustainable future for Paperchase,\" it added.\n\"We are working hard to find that solution and this [notice of administration] is a necessary part of this work. This is not the situation we wanted to be in.\nThe chain is the latest of a string of high-profile retailers to hit trouble in the past year. \nThe sector was already battling with the shift to online sales, coupled with rising costs, including rents and higher minimum wages. \nCoronavirus restrictions which shut non-essential shops piled on the pressure. \nOthers that have run into trouble recently include Debenhams, which last month said it would cease trading putting 12,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, has also gone into administration, putting a further 13,000 jobs at risk.\nMeanwhile, Edinburgh Woollen Mills' brands Peacocks and Jaeger also fell into administration in November, putting 21,000 jobs at risk. \nAnd earlier last year, Oasis and Warehouse fell into administration in mid-April after failing to find buyers, and online fashion group Boohoo said in June it was buying the brands but closing all stores."

      "tags": "Teaching,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Closing schools will have \"grave consequences for children\", Wales' education minister has said.\nAll schools and colleges in Wales have been told to move to online learning until 18 January at the earliest.\nKirsty Williams said the decision was \"really difficult,\" but education \"has a role in supressing the virus\". \nSome school leaders and opposition politicians have questioned whether a two-week classroom closure would be sufficient.\nSchools in England will move to online teaching until February. \nMs Williams told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"I'm a mother too and I'm dreading the prospect of home-schooling. The vast majority of children want to be in school as home-learning is not as good as being in front of teachers.\n\"But we have to understand the seriousness of the situation we face and have the confidence of staff that when they are in school, they are safe.\"\nShe said there was no evidence the new variant was more transmissible in children than adults.\nSchools will only stay closed after 18 January \"if that's the only thing we can do to suppress the virus\", she added.\n\"Clearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face contact for the majority of children is a really really difficult decision and it's a decision which has grave consequences for children.\n\"Education has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard to look after us all.\" \nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities - nurseries and other childcare settings remain open.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nPlaid Cymru called for urgent help for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nJane Jenkins, head teacher at Moorland Primary School in Splott, Cardiff, said: \"We started planning for this before Christmas. It's not really any surprise.\n\"We learnt a lot of lessons in the first lockdown about the difficulties some children and families had with online learning, so we've been able to tailor our support much better this time around.\"\nMother-of-two Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said parents were suffering from \"exhaustion\", but it was the right decision to close schools.\n\"In terms of how it's going to impact on families, I just think we're all tearing our hair out.\n\"Trying to get our kids to actually engage with online learning is a massive task... my kids just don't want to do it, I'm the last person they want to listen to.\"\nChanelle Taylor, a painter and decorator from Caerphilly, said she was worried about balancing schooling with running her business. \nShe said: \"The most worrying concern I have is that with my daughter goes to a Welsh school and we're not Welsh speakers. \n\"It's made a big impact at home trying to home-school her as well as me trying to find childcare to keep my business afloat. \n\"At the moment I'm managing with my mum doing childcare, but it's difficult for my mum because my brother has Asperger's so she also cares for him. At the moment I'm limiting my quotations and working as much as I can without bringing more stress home for my mother.\"\nSara Powell-Davies, who is also from Caerphilly, said she had struggled to get childcare for her four-year-old daughter and other parents she had spoken to had been frustrated by the timing of the announcement. \nShe said: \"You can't do things like this last minute, it's not fair on parents and it's not fair on teachers and schools. \n\"We've been scrambling around now trying to sort out childcare.\"\nStephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of the Independent Sage advisory group, said the focus needed to shift away from keeping schools open to keeping them safe.\n\"A lot of the talk has been about whether schools should be open or closed. Everyone wants schools to be open. We should also be thinking about the best way of making schools safe so we can reopen them as soon as possible,\" he said.\nHe suggested reducing class sizes, hiring more teachers and more spaces and dividing classes.\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said support needed to be made urgently available to children from disadvantaged backgrounds who \"will now fall further behind with their education\".\nShe added: \"Hubs for vulnerable children and the children of key workers are also a necessity alongside an immunisation programme for all school staff so that schools can become a safer environment upon re-opening.\"\nNAHT Cymru, which represents head teachers, welcomed the announcement, saying it had been \"inevitable for some time\".\nDirector Laura Doel added: \"It is uncertain whether the next two weeks will be enough time to ensure a fully risk-assessed plan is put in place.\"\nThe Association of Schools and College Leaders Cymru questioned why it had taken so long for the minister to reach a decision.\nBut Ms Williams said: \"We need to reassess the evidence, which comes through on a daily basis, which makes decision-making really hard. Sometimes, when the data arrives, you simply have to act\". \nThe decision in Wales came as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over Christmas.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nHowever, the latest available data shows both England's and Northern Ireland's Covid case rate has risen above Wales.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, with schools and colleges closed until the end of February half term and pupils being taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nOn Monday, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

      "tags": "Chris Whitty,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nAccording to government figures on Tuesday, the number of people who tested positive was 60,916.\nOne in 50 people in private households in England had Covid last week - and one in 30 in London, according to estimates based on the latest data.\nA further 830 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test.\nIt comes as England and Scotland announced new strict lockdowns, with people told to stay at home.\nAt a press conference at Downing Street on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said 1.3 million people had now been vaccinated in the UK - including 23% of over 80s in England, some 650,000 people.\nBut he said more than one million people were currently infected - with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak.\nThe government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty cited the Office for National Statistics' random sampling data for England as showing how widespread the virus is.\n\"We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,\" he said.\nThat latest estimates include:\nThe number of new daily cases has consistently been above 50,000 since 29 December.\nBack in the first peak of the pandemic in the spring, the number of daily confirmed cases never went above 7,000. \nHowever, it is thought the true number of cases then was much higher but not picked up because testing capacity was limited. It was estimated there were about 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March - but there was not the testing to detect it. \nHospital admissions of people with Covid-19 in England also reached another record high on Tuesday, NHS England figures show.\nAt a hospital in Lincolnshire, a \"critical\" incident has been declared after a sharp rise in patients requiring admission.\nAnd potentially life-saving cancer operations have been put on hold at a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. \nHowever, Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country.\nIn a statement after the case numbers were released, Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the rapid rise in cases was \"highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter\".\nAfter seven consecutive days of more than 50,000 cases being confirmed, the fact that more than 60,000 have been recorded should not come as a surprise.\nIt will take a week, if not more, for the impact of lockdown to be felt.\nAnd all the evidence suggests the new variant of coronavirus, which is more transmissible than previous ones, means the impact is likely to be more limited than it was in previous ones.\nThe figures are also a warning about what the NHS is facing. \nSome of this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions.\nAbout three in 10 beds are now occupied by Covid patients. In some hospitals more than six in 10 are.\nHospitals are now busy making more spaces on their wards - that means cancelling planned work, including in some places cancer treatment.\nBoris Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both announced new lockdowns on Monday.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December.\nRestrictions are also being tightened further in Northern Ireland, and an order for people to stay at home will become legally enforceable from Friday. \nIn a televised address to the nation, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to use the lockdown to create a \"round the clock\" vaccination programme.\nHe also called on people to \"recapture the spirit\" of the beginning of the pandemic.\nAt the press conference on Tuesday, Mr Johnson repeated his suggestion that there is a \"prospect\" of the lockdown being eased in mid-February.\n\"But you will also appreciate there are a lot of caveats, a lot of ifs built into that, the most important of which is that we all now follow the guidance,\" he said.\nEarlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, but \"as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all\".\nMr Whitty said the virus \"is not going to go away, just as flu doesn't go away, just as many other viruses don't go away\".\n\"We shouldn't kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring,\" he said. \nMr Whitty said although hopefully there would be nearly no measures needed from the spring onwards, the government might have to bring in a few restrictions next winter.\nOn Monday the UK's chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nAlthough the new variant is now spreading more rapidly than the original version, it is not believed to be more deadly."

      "text": "A man who stabbed three people to death in a Reading park believed he was carrying out \"an act of religious jihad\", a court has heard.\nKhairi Saadallah, 26, stabbed to death James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, during the attack in Forbury Gardens in June.\nAs part of his sentencing, a hearing will decide if he was motivated by a religious or ideological cause.\nThe prosecution claim the stabbing spree was a terror attack. \nSaadallah has admitted three counts of murder and attempted murder, but denies he was motivated by an ideology.\nProsecutor Alison Morgan QC told the court he \"executed\" his victims and intended to \"kill as many people as he could\" in the name of violent jihad. \nShe said: \"In less than a minute, shouting Allahu Akhbar the defendant carried out a lethal attack with a knife, killing all three men before they had a chance to respond and try to defend themselves.\n\"Within the same minute, the defendant went on to attack others nearby, stabbing three more people, Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, causing them significant injuries.\"\nStating the prosecution's case she said the attack was \"carefully planned and executed\" by the defendant with \"determination and precision\".\nShe added: \"The defendant believed that in carrying out this attack he was acting in pursuit of his extreme ideology, an ideology he appears to have held for some time.\n\"He believed that in killing as many people as possible that day he was performing an act of religious jihad.\"\nAfter the attack Sadallah fled but was chased down by police, and later admitted the attacks in his cell, the court heard. \nIn interviews with police he \"howled like a dog\" and claimed to have magic powers, which the prosecution said was a \"disingenuous\" attempt to suggest he had a mental disorder. \n\"After a careful period of assessment and treatment at Belmarsh prison, it is clear that he does not have a major mental illness\", a report by a psychiatrist read out in court said.\nSaadallah arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker in 2012, having fled the civil war in his home country of Libya in North Africa.\nThe court heard the defendant, who had been refused asylum, had been involved with militias as part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. \nBetween 2013 and 2020 he was repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences in the UK.\nWhile in HMP Bullingdon, Saadallah was observed to be keen to interact with radical preacher Omar Brooks - associated with banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun - who was also at the jail at the time, the court heard. He was released from the prison in June, days before the attack. \nSaadallah had been due to be deported, but was told by the government circumstances in Libya at the time were a \"legal barrier\". \nThe court was told he had also searched on the internet \"how to disappear with magic\" and accessed a website with the flag associated with Islamic State.   \nA probation officer who had contact with Saadallah flagged his concerns about his mental health, but a psychiatrist has since concluded the attack on June 20 was \"unrelated to the effects of either mental disorder or substance misuse\". \nSaadallah, of Basingstoke Road in Reading, launched his attack as people enjoyed a summer Saturday evening in Forbury Gardens on 20 June.\nEyewitnesses said he walked along a footpath when he suddenly ran towards a group of men sitting on the grass.\nHistory teacher Mr Furlong and Mr Ritchie-Bennett, a US citizen, were both stabbed once in the neck, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed in the back.\nAll three were pronounced dead at the scene.\nThree others - their friend Stephen Young, as well as Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sitting in a nearby group - were also injured by Saadallah.\nThe sentencing before Mr Justice Sweeney is expected to conclude on January 11."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some 1.3 million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, says the government.\nIn England, that includes nearly a quarter of the most elderly, vulnerable patients.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it meant that within a two to three weeks they should have a \"significant degree of immunity\" to the virus.  \nHe said there would be a ramping up to get more people immunised - up to 2 million a week. \nThe ambition is to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February. That will require around 13 million vaccinations. \nHe defended the UK's policy of immunising more people with one dose immediately - rather than holding some stock back to give people a second booster shot - in order to save \"the most lives the fastest\". \nUS regulators have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it is a pragmatic decision to protect more people.\nBoth the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection.\nInitially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose.\nBut when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the policy would now change - the new priority would be to give as many people a first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses in as short a time as possible.\nEveryone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first.\nEngland's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told the Downing Street press conference that extending the gap between the first and second jabs would mean the number of people vaccinated can be doubled over three months.\n\"If over that period there is more than 50% protection then you have actually won. More people will have been protected than would have been otherwise.\n\"Our quite strong view is that protection is likely to be lot more than 50%.\"\nAsked whether the longer gap could lead to an increase risk of the virus mutating into a version that could escape the vaccine, he said it was a worry, but a small one. \nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccines would probably need to be changed further down the line to continue to be a good match for the virus - but that this was relatively quick to do. \nOne of the exciting things about the science of the RNA vaccines is that they are incredibly fast to make in response to new mutations, he said.

      "text": "The PM acted \"decisively\" in announcing a new lockdown in England \"in the face of new information\", Rishi Sunak says.\nPeople must now stay at home except for a handful of permitted reasons and schools have closed to most pupils.\nThe chancellor said the action was \"regrettable\" but it was \"right we take these measures\", which will be reviewed on 15 February, to suppress the virus.\nIt came after UK chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nBoris Johnson said vaccinating the top four priority groups by mid-February could allow restrictions to be eased, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove telling Sky News the measures may remain until March.\nMeanwhile, the prime minister is due to hold a press conference in Downing Street at 17:00 GMT with chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance.\nTough new lockdown restrictions forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons have also come into force across the Scottish mainland. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December.\nThe UK reported a record 58,784 cases on Monday, as well as a further 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Gove told BBC Breakfast: \"The four chief medical officers of the United Kingdom met and discussed the situation yesterday and their recommendation was that the country had to move to level five, the highest level available of alert that meant there was an imminent danger to the NHS of being overwhelmed unless action was taken.\n\"And so in the circumstances we felt that the only thing we could do was to close those primary schools that were open.\"\nHe said the action was taken \"with the heaviest of hearts\" and \"we had to act\" following that advice.\n\"It is a very, very difficult time for the whole country, that's why it's so important we do everything we can in government to vaccinate people,\" he said.\nHe said a million people had been vaccinated so far \"up until the weekend\" and it was hoped that number would reach more than 13 million in February.\nWhen asked about the target of two million vaccines a week and concerns over logistics and the safety systems, Mr Gove said the vaccination process was a \"complicated exercise\" but the NHS \"has more than risen to the challenge\".\nThe government was \"looking at further options\" to restrict international travel, he said.\nMr Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, adding: \"I think it is right to say that as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all.\"\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove saying the lockdown may have to last to March may not come as much of a surprise to many.\nWhile the government has set a target of offering the most at-risk a jab by mid February, it will take several weeks longer for the full effect to be felt given it takes time for an immune response to kick in. \nThe bigger question is whether or not the government could have acted earlier.\nIt was clear before Christmas the new variant was pushing up infection rates - and that in turn would mean more hospital admissions.\nThe delay looks costly. Since Christmas Day, the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital has risen by 50% alone - enough to fill 18 hospitals.\nWhile the government did introduce tier four the weekend before Christmas in parts of the south east of England, which banned mixing over the festive period and led to the closure of non-essential shops and gyms, most of the country were allowed to meet up on Christmas Day.\nInfections from Christmas Day are now being felt - the numbers have been rising sharply ever since. Some of these are next week's hospital admissions - and is why the chief medical officers warned of the risk of hospitals becoming overwhelmed, which Mr Gove said persuaded them to act on Monday.\nIf lockdown had come earlier, it may well have been shorter.\nProf Andrew Hayward - a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the lockdown measures \"will save tens of thousands of lives\".\nBut he said \"the virus is different\" and \"it may be that the lockdown measures that we have are not enough\"\n\"This lockdown period we need to do more than just stay at home, wait for the vaccine, we need to be actively bearing down on it,\" he said.\nAt Scotland's daily briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for people to hold on to the fact there was now \"a clear route out of this pandemic\".\nShe said there had been urgent discussions between the four home nations about whether border controls should be tightened - and she hoped there would be an announcement soon.\nIn other developments:\nAnnouncing England's lockdown on Monday, Mr Johnson said hospitals were under \"more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic\".\nHe ordered people to stay indoors other than for limited exceptions - such as essential medical needs, food shopping, exercise and work that cannot be done at home - and said schools and colleges should move to remote teaching for the majority of students until at least half term.\nPeople who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said.\nWhile the rules become law in the early hours of Wednesday, people should follow them now, Mr Johnson added.\nMr Johnson said the new variant of coronavirus, which is up to 70% more transmissible, was spreading in a \"frustrating and alarming\" manner and warned that the number of Covid-19 patients in English hospitals is 40% higher than the first peak.\n The House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on England's new restrictions on Wednesday.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would \"support the package of measures\", saying \"we've all got to pull together now to make this work\".\nIn England:\nIn mainland Scotland and Skye:\nHow will you be affected by the latest developments?

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers.\nThe British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. \nIt says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols.\nThese are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19.\nThis follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units.\nPublic Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updated in October 2020.\nEarly in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated.\nBut research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. \nMost infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. \nAcross the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. \nMore sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols.\nIn their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. \nBut they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. \nThe letter states: \"It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission\".\nBarry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. \nHe is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. \nA signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it.\n\"There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place.\"\nHe believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients.\nSurgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about \u00a35.00.  \nDr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid,\nHe points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. \n\"We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us.\"\nA few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance.\nIt's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. \nOne consultant, who did not want to be named, said: \"When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act.\"\nRCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: \"Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. \n\"While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases.\"\nPublic Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline.\n\"UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data.\n\"Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.\""

      "text": "The government closed schools in England with \"the heaviest of hearts\", Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said, as he confirmed this year's GCSE and A-level exams have been cancelled.\nThe decision was made after the UK's chief medical officers recommended a move to Covid threat level five.\nMr Gove said teacher-led assessments would have to be used and efforts would be made to ensure grades are fair.\nHowever, there are growing calls for vocational exams to be cancelled.\nMany BTecs and technical exams are due to take place in the coming days, but head teachers and college leaders say it would be impossible to hold them and unfair to candidates.\nThe mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region also called for the exams to be binned.\nIn a statement, they said: \"It is unfair to ask these students to go into colleges when everyone else is being told to stay at home and schools and colleges are closed to the majority of students. \n\"This will cause unnecessary anxiety and concern just when they need to be able to focus. \n\"Secondly, students in the Liverpool and Greater Manchester City Regions have faced restrictions for far longer, with more time being spent out of college, than students in other parts of the country, therefore these exams will not be a level playing field.\"\nAll primary and secondary schools are closed to pupils, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, for the next six weeks. Teaching will continue remotely.\nBut nurseries and early years settings are being told to remain open. Providers says they are concerned about the risk to staff and the wider community.\nOne head teacher, Neil Strowger from Bohunt School in Hampshire, said he was \"bitterly disappointed and quite upset\" for students who have suffered so much disruption this year and \"fearful\" about what it would mean for them.\nAnother head teacher Evelyn Ford, of Copthall School in north London, said school leaders had been working hard over Christmas and this week to roll out mass testing and now had to shift their focus to provide lessons remotely for the next six weeks. \nAnd, despite the government saying vocational exams such as BTec should go ahead, with some scheduled for this week, the Association of School and College Leaders said that seemed \"pretty impossible\".\nOn Sunday Boris Johnson said he had \"no doubt\" that schools were safe, but on Monday he said pupils were transmitting the virus into homes and the community. \nFather-of-four, Glen, told the BBC he was angry at having to now juggle home schooling with working from home.\nHe said: \"This wasn't something unforeseen. This wasn't something that came along and hit us out of the blue.\"\nAnother mother, Camille Barbagallo, said parents \"should not have to be in this position\".\n\"We've been hearing of 50,000 cases plus a day, day in day out,\" she added.\nAnother father, Emeka, was resigned to the situation, saying: \"It's a sacrifice we have to make. We take it on the chin for the country.\"\nFormer head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, he did not think the education department \"was being led well at the moment\".\n\"If you talk to head teachers\u2026they lack confidence in the leadership they're receiving,\" he said, adding that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should \"take final accountability for what's gone on\".\nMr Gove said the Department for Education was working with exams regulator Ofqual, to find a way to assess students that is fair,\nEducation secretary Gavin Williamson is expected to make a statement on exams in Wednesday, but it is understood that work is ongoing to plan for what will replace them.\nSummer exams were cancelled weeks ago on Scotland and Wales, with a range of methods of internal school assessment to be used instead to judge pupils' progress. Some exams are due to go ahead in Northern Ireland.\nBy Hannah Richardson, BBC News education reporter\nIt was the step the government said it would never take - closing schools again in England to all but a small number of children.\nAgain and again we were told education was the priority and schools would remain fully open.\nThe Department for Education stood firm against a crescendo of calls for a circuit-breaker during the October half-term, then against an early holiday in December.\nSelf-isolating teachers were going to extraordinary lengths to teach remotely from home, while heads created one-way systems, sanitiser stations and installed temperature scanners in school receptions.\nBut the attendance figures were showing week after week how the virus was impacting on pupils' ability to show up.\nFor a while, mass testing of pupils seemed to be the answer, but the short time available for head teachers to set this up made it a non-starter.\nIn the end it was the pressure on the NHS, caused by the new, more contagious variant of coronavirus, which sounded the closing bell for schools.\nTo shut them was the only lever government had left to pull to try to turn the tanker as a new tide of Covid cases began sweeping the nation.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would be unfair to run the vocational exams.\nAnd the Association of Colleges, which represents further education colleges where many exams are due to be taken, has written to the government calling for vocational and technical exams to be cancelled \"without delay\".\nIt also argued there may be difficulties in finding invigilators to actually run the exams.\nAnd nursery providers are questioning how it can be safe to open early years settings, but not schools.\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of Early Years Alliance, said: \"Many of those working in the early years feel terrified and abandoned by the government. They are being asked to remain on the frontline during the most worrying period of a global pandemic with no PPE, no testing and no access to vaccinations.\"\nAnne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, said that remote learning and time out of school had a \"very negative impact\" for children, and called on the government to ensure consistency in remote learning and access to technology.\nShe said: \"A lot of pupils still don't have laptops. They are surviving on broken phones - those children now need to be seen as a priority to get into the classroom and deemed to be a vulnerable child.\"\nIt is understood Ofsted inspectors may be asked to monitor how well schools are providing remote learning. \nTechnology companies and broadband providers needed to \"step up\" and address the cost of data for remote learning, which was another obstacle for some families, Ms Longfield said."

      "text": "An order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home - to stop the spread of Covid-19 - will become legally enforceable from Friday.\nThe executive agreed the move after it met on Tuesday and tightened other measures.\nIt will mean people can only leave home for medical or food needs, exercise and work that cannot be done from home.\nNI is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed.\nMinisters also agreed to a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to reintroduce enforcement powers for the PSNI to order people to go home if they are engaging in prohibited activity.\nSpeaking after the meeting, First Minister Arlene Foster said people should not wait for the regulations to take effect and insisted people should already be staying at home.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland faced a \"difficult period ahead\", but that the interventions were necessary.\nHowever, she said the executive had not reached agreement on whether GCSE or A-level exams should go ahead, and that further meetings would need to take place later this week.\n\"We will also have an urgent meeting convened tomorrow with faith groups, hopefully moving them all to online services,\" she added.\nIndoor and outdoor gatherings will be reduced from 15 people to six and only from two households, which will include children under 12 - exemptions will apply such as support bubbles.\nPeople will no longer be allowed to meet with other households in private gardens, although similar exemptions will apply there too. \nHowever, people will be allowed to take exercise outdoors with one person from another household. \nThe executive also supported a proposal from the health minister to make it a requirement for all employers to conduct a risk assessment where employees are required to work away from their home. \nMinisters agreed the measures will last until 6 February, and be reviewed along with other lockdown measures on 21 January.\nMany pupils will not return to school until after the half-term break in mid-February, with nursery, primary and post-primary schools carrying out remote learning until then.\nHowever, ministers agreed that special schools will remain open as usual.\nVulnerable children and children of key workers will have access to schools for supervised learning. \nChildcare settings will be allowed to remain open and childminders can continue their services.\nPayments to parents of children who receive free school meals will also continue, the Department of Education has confirmed.\nDiscussions on exams took place, but ministers agreed to revisit this issue.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir said: \"Work is ongoing on this issue as a matter of urgency and I intend to provide further clarity in the next couple of days. \n\"Until and unless any announcement is made, students should expect to continue to sit scheduled examinations.\"\nOn Tuesday evening, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said \"further flexibilities\" would be put in place for January exams and assessments, particularly in relation to BTecs. \nShe said: \"Learning centres, including further education colleges, schools and training providers, will be afforded additional discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for learners to sit the scheduled BTec exams in January, taking into consideration a range of factors including health and safety and the personal circumstances of their learners.\"\nIt has also been confirmed that post-primary school transfer tests have been cancelled this month due to the surge in the number of coronavirus cases.\nThe first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, was due to take place on Saturday.\nBut the Association for Quality Education (AQE) later announced that a single transfer test would be held on Saturday 27 February.\nThe guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable - and had to shield during the first lockdown in March - is not expected to change.\nMinisters are due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, a further 18 coronavirus-related deaths - 11 in the past 24 hours and seven in the past week - were recorded by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 1,384. \nThe department recorded a further 1,378 cases of the virus, with 577 confirmed patients in hospital, 45 of whom are in intensive care. \nMore than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the previous week.\nNorthern Ireland's director of the Royal College of Surgeons warned the health service could soon struggle to deal with the number of people needing treatment.\n\"That's not just the Covid patients - it's the patients who have a heart attack, a stroke, the people who fall and break their hip,\" said Dr Mark Taylor.\n\"But the difficulty is the more the system is pulled to deal with Covid, the less ability we have to deal with other aspects.\n\"The more Covid overwhelms the intensive care units then we're into really difficult ethical decisions... which no doctor wants to make in terms of who requires that ventilator.\""

      "text": "Scots are to be ordered to stay at home amid a fresh Covid-19 lockdown which will see schools remain closed to pupils until February.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new curbs would be introduced at midnight in a bid to contain the new, faster-spreading strain of the virus.\nNew laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible.\nOutdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household.\nPlaces of worship are to be closed, group exercise banned, and schools will largely operate via online and remote learning.\nThese rules will apply across the Scottish mainland until at least the end of January, and will be kept under review.\nIsland areas will remain in level three - but Ms Sturgeon said they would be monitored carefully.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later announced similar lockdown measures for the whole of England with all schools and colleges closing to most pupils until mid February.\nA further 1,905 new cases were reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said \"illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation\".\nThe first minister said she was \"more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year\", with the new coronavirus strain now accounting for half of new cases.\nAnd she said a \"steeply rising trend of infections\" was threatening to put \"significant pressure\" on NHS services, saying hospitals could breach capacity within three to four weeks.\nThe new rules - which will be put down in law - mean Scots will only be allowed to leave home for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine, exercise and caring responsibilities.\nNo limit is to be put on how many times people can go out to exercise, but outdoor meetings are to be limited to a maximum of two people from two households.\nEveryone who can work from home will be required to, and people in the \"shielding\" category are advised not to go in to work at all.\nThe construction and manufacturing industries will remain open, but Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review.\nPlaces of worship are to close, the number of people who can attend weddings is to be cut to five, and funeral wakes will no longer be allowed.\nSchools are to remain closed to the majority of pupils until February, with Ms Sturgeon saying community transmission of the virus must be brought to a lower level amid concerns that the new variant of the virus spreads more easily among young people.\nShe said she knew remote learning presented \"significant challenges\" for parents, teachers and pupils, adding: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils are quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"\nThe first minister said she was considering whether teachers could be given the Covid-19 vaccine as a priority.\nMore than 100,000 people have been given a first dose of the vaccine in Scotland, and the government expects to have access to just over 900,000 doses by the end of January.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said the best way to get schools open again was to drive down transmission of the virus - urging Scots to abide by the rules.\nThese are the toughest restrictions Scotland has faced since the lockdown of March 2020. \nIt is - once again - becoming compulsory to stay at home except for essential purposes like food shopping, exercise and medical care. \nThe extended closure of schools to most pupils is something the Scottish government was particularly keen to avoid. \nThese decisions are a measure of how worried ministers are about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is fast becoming the dominant strain. \nWith 225 cases per 100,000 people, Scotland is thought to be about four weeks behind London, which already has four times as many cases and NHS services under considerable pressure. \nThe Scottish government believes that without further action the NHS here would run out of beds for Covid patients within a month. \nThis new alert comes at the start of a new year which also brings new hope for a route out of the pandemic with two vaccines now beginning to offer protection. \nAround 100,000 doses have already been administered in Scotland but it is likely to take several months to reach all in the most vulnerable groups.\nThe first minister said Scotland was now in \"a race between the vaccine and the virus\".\nShe said: \"The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine. But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.\n\"We can already see - by looking at infection rates in the south of England - some of what could happen here in Scotland. To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.\n\"For government, that means introducing tough measures - as we have done today. And for all of us, it means sticking to the rules.\"\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson raised concerns about online learning, saying it was vital that pupils had \"equal access to high-quality education\".\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers and working parents would need support to make the remote learning system work.\nMs Sturgeon said her government had \"agonised\" over the decision on schools, and said the \"fundamental priority\" was to re-open them in full as soon as possible.\nShe said: \"Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.\"\nThe NHS has coped so far in Scotland - more so than many other parts of the UK. \nBut in places like Glasgow and Lanarkshire it has been very, very tight. And here like everywhere else staff are bracing themselves for the post-Christmas effects of rising cases. \nThe first minister gave some stark figures on hospital and ICU occupancy - suggesting we are just weeks away from reaching limits. \nThere is so little give in the system they will be glad to see everything possible done to prevent stretched services being overwhelmed at a time when we are on our way to getting out the other side. \nThere is real anxiety about what the next few weeks might bring."

      "title": "Covid-19: Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout begins in Northern Ireland",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing",
      "text": "Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine this week.\nThe aim is to ensure everyone in that age group will be offered the vaccine by the end of January.\nThirty GP practices will be administering 50,000 doses of the vaccine, which was approved for use in the UK on 30 December.\nIt is the second vaccine to be approved in the battle against coronavirus in Northern Ireland.\nIt comes ahead of a UK-wide announcement by the prime minister, set to be made at 20:00 GMT on Monday, in which further restrictions will be announced.  \nIn a statement, a No 10 spokesman said the new variant of Covid-19 had \"led to rapidly escalating case numbers across the country\" and \"further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise\".\nOn Monday, Northern Ireland recorded a further 1,801 Covid-19 cases and 12 more virus-related deaths. \nThese latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,366, while 79,873 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic started. \nMore than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the week before.\nThe seven-day rate per 100,000 people is now 660 positive cases, compared to 200 per 100,000 two weeks ago.\nMedical experts believe that is down to the two-week easing of restrictions over the Christmas period.\nIn the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus.\nNorthern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed.\nThe first doses of the vaccine were given delivered at a GP surgery on the Falls Road in West Belfast on Monday afternoon. \nThe first person in Northern Ireland to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine was 94-year-old Eileen Lynch.\nSpeaking after receiving the vaccine, Ms Lynch said she was \"delighted and privileged\" to receive it. \n\"I feel like I can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated,\" she said. \nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has already been used to vaccinate care home residents and staff.\nBy mid December, 50,000 doses of that vaccine had been made available and by 30 December, Northern Ireland's Department of Health reported that 33,000 people had been vaccinated.\nThis included 8,940 care home residents, 10,484 care home staff and 14,259 health and social care staff. \nAccording to the latest NI statistics, for the first time the percentage positive cases in the over 80s is down - an indication the vaccination process is working.   \nThere are approximately 82,000 people over 80 in NI and BBC News NI understands that if deliveries of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine happen as planned, it is thought that all of those over 80, as well as GPs and their staff, could be vaccinated within three weeks. \nWhile 50,000 doses have been delivered to Northern Ireland, a further 23,000 vaccines are expected on 19 January while another 68,000 are due on 24 January.\nDr Alan Stout, who is a GP in Belfast, told BBC News NI that members are \"very optimistic\" that 11,000 people can be vaccinated this week.\nNI's chief medical officer said the Oxford-AstraZeneca rollout would run alongside the ongoing vaccination programme.\nDr Michael McBride said: \"First and foremost we must act to protect those most at risk of severe disease and death.  \n\"The evidence shows that the initial dose of vaccine offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus. \n\"Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality and hospitalisations, protecting the health and social care system.\"\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has to be kept at an extremely low temperature which complicates handling constraints.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is considered easier to store and distribute.\nIts rollout consists of two full doses of the vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first.\nGPs are appealing to the public to remain calm and wait to be called for their vaccine either by telephone or by letter.\nDr Stout said as demand grows worldwide for the vaccine, that schedule could easily change.    \n\"The public have to be patient, we have a system and must be allowed to get on with it - it really is 'don't call us - we will call you'.\" \nWhile some vaccinations will take place in surgeries others will happen in a drive-through system.\nCovid-19 is deadlier than flu, which means January 2021 is going to be even tougher than usual. \nAlso, Covid patients tend to stay much longer in hospital with more severe symptoms requiring additional beds and care. \nBut those rising patient numbers aren't matched by an increased workforce.\nInstead it is expected that the nurse-patient ratio will increase (even though many aren't trained to work in critical care) as there simply aren't enough nurses available. \nSome health unions fear this will only add to Northern Ireland's excess mortality rate, which is greater than that in Great Britain. \nOnce again, this highlights Northern Ireland's failing health care system, which was already below par well before the start of the pandemic.\nCoronavirus infection figures here are expected to peak between 15 and 21 January. That will be felt not only in hospitals but also in GP practices as they continue to roll out the vaccine. \nWhile at this stage the six weeks look bleak it's hoped that the additional Astra-Zeneca vaccine and the low incidence of flu will go a long way in not only saving lives, but also protecting the health service.\nDr Stout said much planning had gone into ensuring the programme happened as smoothly as possible.\n\"People will literally stay in their cars and be asked to roll up their sleeves - it has to be safe and efficient in order for us to get through it and safely.\"  \nThe UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people.\nMeanwhile, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said it was \"appalling\" that the Pfizer vaccine was not to be administered in two doses within 21 days as instructed by the company and threatened legal action.\nDr Black was responding to news that the UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart.\n\"They have left care workers in Northern Ireland with a gap in their expected immunity,\" he told BBC NI's Radio Foyle on Monday.\n\"In that period doctors, nurses, porters or health care professionals could infect patients because they will not be protected against the transmission of the infection to patients.\"\nThe UK's chief medical officers have defended their Covid vaccination plan.\nThey said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab was \"much more preferable\" and that the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine.\nDr Black is to meet NI Health Minister Robin Swann later to express health care workers' concern over the change in vaccine policy."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK \"cannot duck\" tackling inequalities of health, ethnicity, education and jobs post-Covid, a major review has warned.\nThe report's chairman, Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton, says a lot of work to repair and rebuild the damage will be needed after the pandemic.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) Deaton Review of Inequalities warned the fabric of society was under threat.\nLaunched 18 months ago, the review says Covid-19 worsened existing problems.\nThe review says there is a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle the disadvantages faced by many that this pandemic has so devastatingly exposed\".\n\"We now face a set of challenges which we cannot duck.\"\nSir Angus said: \"As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most.\n\"We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong.\"\nWhile the pandemic had highlighted the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and deprived communities, it also showed that the UK's best-paid and most highly educated have been \"much better able to ride out the crisis\", the report said.\nChildren from poorer households found it harder to do schoolwork during lockdown and have been more likely to miss school since September, it noted.\nAnd while the biggest risk factor for coronavirus is age, younger people have been hit harder by the economic consequences of the crisis.\nThe cost of the pandemic is \"just colossal\" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"We've seen the biggest reduction in national income, essentially in history, over the last year, we've seen the biggest public deficit in history outside of the two world wars, so there's no getting around the fact that the pandemic and the response to it has had a bigger effect on the economy than anything essentially in the whole of history.\"\nThe report highlighted the effects of the pandemic on different groups, including on education, which is \"probably more worrying\" than the overall economic effect, Mr Johnson said.\n\"The first lockdown lockdown saw a dreadful impact on the education particularly of poorer children... they were getting less in the way of online lessons from their schools.\n\"There's a huge private school/state school divide in this, but also a big divide within state schools between those children who had support at home, had the facilities at home - laptops and internet and so on - but who also had the support from school - so there's a big impact on education but also a very unequal one,\" he added.\nThe review is calling for extra support for children who have fallen behind and help for school and university leavers to find jobs. \nIt says the welfare safety net must be adapted so it supports non-traditional forms of employment, including insecure and self-employed workers, and minority ethnic groups must be given greater economic opportunities.\nProgress in reducing poor mental and physical health could be \"one of the clearest indications of success of economic and social policy\", it adds.\nMark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the review, said: \"Individuals are subject to a wide range of potential vulnerabilities around dimensions including age, ethnicity, place of birth, education, income and the nature of their employment.\n\"Where these vulnerabilities intersect, they can amplify and reinforce one another and play a huge role in driving unequal outcomes.\"\nHowever, the government said it was already spending vast sums to support people and the economy through the pandemic. \nA spokesman said: \"We're doing everything we can to ensure our coronavirus support reaches those who need it the most, which is why we've invested more than \u00a3280bn to protect the incomes, livelihoods and health of millions of people across the UK.\"\nThis included an additional \u00a39bn for the welfare system and \u00a32bn for the Kickstart Scheme, tripling traineeships, incentives for firms hiring apprentices and doubling the number of work coaches \"so that nobody is left without hope or opportunity\", the spokesman said."

      "title": "Covid: Can we really jab our way out of lockdown?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "With the country in lockdown and a new faster-spreading variant of coronavirus rampant, it's clear the UK is in a race to vaccinate. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson wants all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers to be offered a jab by mid-February, to allow the restrictions to be eased. \nThat requires about 13 million people to be given the opportunity to be vaccinated - but so far only one million have been.\nAnd ensuring a quick rollout to the rest is fraught with difficulties. \nThere is enough vaccine in the country, BBC News has learned, but getting it into people's arms could be hampered by:\nTwo Covid vaccines have now been approved - one produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and another made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\nThe UK government has ordered 140 million doses - enough for the whole population. \nThe first hurdle is manufacture of the vaccine. \nThis involves two crucial stages - the production of the substance and then a process called fill and finish whereby the vaccine is put into vials and packaged up for use.\nAnd there is already a concern about the latter stage, with the availability of key ingredients and equipment including glass vials a key issue. \nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says fill and finish was a \"critically short resource across the globe\".\nThat is part of the reason why the amount of the two vaccines ready to go is more limited than ministers had hoped. \nUK plants have made somewhere around 15 million or so doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - that in itself is less than ministers said would be made at this stage (early in the pandemic they said there would be 30 million by the autumn).\nBut only four million have been through the fill-and-finish process. \nThe UK has used plants in Germany and the Netherlands to do some of this for the early batches.\nBut the government has also invested in a plant in Wrexham to ensure there is domestic capacity.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, meanwhile, is made outside of the UK - it comes from a plant in Belgium. \nWhen it arrives in the UK, it has already been placed into vials.\nBut so far, fewer than five million doses have been delivered - less than half the number that should have been - because of problems with manufacture, including the fill-and-finish process.\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said it had been monitoring the supply chain for \"some time\" and was confident the arrangements in place for the supply and onward deployment of vaccines were sufficient.\nEven once a vaccine is in the vials though, there is still one more step before the NHS can start using it. \nEach batch has to be checked and certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory Agency.\nAnd it can be several weeks before the vaccine can be given to the NHS to put in people's arms.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called this a \"rate-limiting factor\".\nAbout four million doses of the Oxford vaccine have been available for some weeks - they were put into vials last year - but as yet only just over 500,000 have been certified as safe to use.\nSources close to the NHS vaccination programme said this had been one of the key frustrations - saying it was taking up to 20 days for batches to be tested and released.\nThe MHRA said each batch had to be biologically tested for quality, while the manufacturer's documentation describing its production and quality-control testing process was reviewed.\nThose close to the process say it does take a couple of weeks - and with more vaccine being produced, there is increased demand on the labs that do the work.\n\"You have to remember this is being injected into people,\" they said. \"We cannot rush this.\"\nBoth vaccines have to go through this process.\nOnce batches have been certified, they are ready to be distributed to the NHS vaccination centres.\nEventually, there will be a network of more than 1,000 local centres across the UK.\nCurrently, just over 700 are up and running. \nThese are being run from a wide variety of venues, from hospitals and large GP centres to community venues, racecourses and, perhaps in the future, conference centres and sports stadiums.\nThe instability of the Pfizer-BioNTech has been well documented. \nIt has to be kept in ultra-cold storage and, once thawed, used within five days.\nThis has meant it is stored at major hospitals and gives the local vaccination centres just days to use up batches after they are delivered.\nThe Oxford vaccine, meanwhile, can be stored at fridge temperature, which makes it easier to distribute.\nBut even once they are at these vaccination centres, delivery of both vaccines is dependent on having the right numbers of staff available.\nCurrently, GPs, nurses, healthcare assistants and pharmacists are giving the vaccines. \nBut as the vaccination campaign ramps up, these will need to be supplemented by additional vaccinators.\nProvision has been made to train other health professionals, from physiotherapists and dentists to dieticians.\nBut there are reports an \"overload of bureaucracy\" - including mandatory courses in fire safety and preventing radicalisation - is slowing down this training.\nMinisters have said they will try to reduce the bureaucracy - amid warnings by the National Audit Office an army of nearly 50,000 vaccinators will be needed.\nAlthough at the moment, there are thought to be enough staff to cope with the limited amount of vaccines available.\nBritish Medical Association GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey said: \"We will need support eventually but not now. \n\"At the moment, the biggest issue is the NHS having enough supply of the vaccine to give.\"\nNearly a million doses have been given since people started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in early December, which puts the UK third globally in the most vaccinations done per head.\nAnd with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being used from this week, the NHS is hoping to double that number in the next seven days.\nGovernment sources said there would be disappointment if it did not reach two million doses a week by late January.\nThat - and a little bit more - will be needed to hit the mid-February target.\nBut even then, and assuming most people in these priority groups have come forward, the impact would not be immediate. \nIt takes a few weeks for the immune response to kick in.\nSo it would be early March before the full impact of the vaccination of these priority groups is felt.\nThen, however, it could have a significant effect.\nClose to nine in 10 Covid deaths have been in these priority groups.\nThey will have had only one dose, which, for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, is effective at preventing 70% of infections.\nBut the evidence suggests this will be enough to stop serious illness.\nSo if all goes to plan, the pathway to significantly easing restrictions comes into view.\nBut the complex nature of the supply chain coupled with the complexity of delivering vaccines to large numbers of people means it will take just one thing to go wrong to cause serious problems getting the UK out of this lockdown in the timeframe hoped."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "It has been described as a \"momentous day\" in the fight against Covid-19 as the rollout of the second Covid vaccine begins in Wales.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said the start of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme was \"a key milestone\" in the fight against Covid. \nThe Welsh Government said 40,000 doses will be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week.\nMore than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose.\nThe number of mass vaccination centres in Wales will be increased to 22 and more than 60 GP surgeries will offer the Oxford vaccine - mobile units will also be set up throughout Wales.\nOne of the first people to receive the vaccine on Monday was Ralph Evans, 88, who was vaccinated at the Pontcae medical practice in Merthyr Tydfil.\nHe was one of eight people there to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Mr Evans said he was \"very grateful\" to be getting it. \nHe was followed by 86-year-old Derek Games, former mayor of Merthyr, who said: \"I'm delighted, I'm very privileged to have it.\"\nThe medical centre hopes to vaccinate 1,000 people by the end of January after being contacted on New Year's Eve about starting vaccinations.\n\"We received a hundred vaccines at lunchtime today,\" practice manager Kevin Rogers said. \"We hope to get through the hundred this week.\"\nMr Rogers said they would be asking staff to work additional hours on weekends to help reach the target of 1,000 people over the coming weeks.\nThe Welsh Government's priority is to vaccinate front-line health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and people over 80.\nPlaid Cymru said \"serious questions\" remained about the roll-out plans, while a professor in palliative medicine said she was concerned \"at the very slow apparent roll out\" for those aged over 85.\nMari Lloyd Williams, from the University of Liverpool, said \"huge numbers have self-shielded since March\".\n\"Apart from intense loneliness this leads to loss of confidence and reduction in both physical and mental and cognitive well-being, meaning that some may need to enter full time care sooner,\" she said.\n\"We need to be vaccinating 24/7 in order to get this under control and to protect our most vulnerable.\"\nThe Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures so can be administered in doctors surgeries, pharmacies and care homes.\nDialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, was the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Oxford.\n\"It is an absolutely momentous day,\" said Dr Gillian Richardson, who is leading the Covid vaccination programme in Wales.\n\"The vaccine has been prioritised for those groups where it has been harder to reach with the Pfizer vaccine - so we're prioritising the over 80s and care home staff and residents.\"\nMs Richardson said the pace of the rollout \"will be governed by supply\" and \"will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months.\"\nBoth vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks - a change from the previous advice of four weeks between jabs.\nThe change has been \"very controversial\", according to one GP who will administer the Oxford vaccine, but she agrees with the decision.\n\"The evidence suggests that a longer time period between first dose and second booster gives you better immunity,\" said Dr Rowena Christmas, a Monmouthshire GP whose surgery is part of the rollout pilot.\n\"The key thing is we need to protect people. If we gave 1,000 second doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week then that's 1,000 people who won't get the first protection.\n\"As soon as you have the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, within about 10 days you've got 70% protection from coronavirus.\n\"But if you are in the 30% that does catch it, you're much less likely to get severely ill and much less likely to go to hospital.\n\"We are in a crisis situation and we have to protect as many people as we possibly can.\"\nWales is under \"stay at home\" lockdown restrictions after a rise in Covid-19 cases - with more than 31,000 cases in Wales in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nThere are almost 2,700 people with coronavirus symptoms in Welsh hospitals - with \"more than half\" of the 208 critical care patients having Covid.\nBut Mr Gething said Wales' overall Covid incidence rate had fallen from a high of 636 cases per 100,000 people before the lockdown started to 446 cases on Monday.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas with nine out of the top 10 of the UK's most infected counties in Wales.\nLatest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\n\"Cases of the virus remain very high\" although rates had fallen back from the incredibly high levels from just before Christmas,\" said Mr Gething.\nThe British Medical Association in Wales said there was concern among staff that a 12-week gap between doses could lead to \"sacrificing some immunity\" because trials had involved a shorter gap. \nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford said the longer time between doses and the rollout of a second jab would see the pace of vaccinations increase.\n\"By the end of the month we will be doing in a day what we've been able to do in a week prior to Christmas, maybe more than that,\" he said.\nUnlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures so will have fewer storage and transport issues, making it much easier to use in care homes and GP surgeries.\n\"This is a game changer in the fight against Covid, it's absolutely huge,\" Dr Christmas, principal GP at the Wye Valley Practice, told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We need this vaccine because it's easy to give. We can now all get involved and start this rollout of this crucial vaccination programme.\"\nThe Welsh Government said every health board in Wales will receive its allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver.\nBut it warned the effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice remained to keep contacts with others to a minimum, keep a two-metre distance from others, wash hands regularly, wear a face covering where required and avoid touching surfaces others have touched. \nPeople have also been asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital to ask when they will get a vaccine and wait for a letter which \"will provide people with a measure of assurance\" and will explain how they will be contacted.\nMr Gething said: \"Today marks a key milestone in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\"Its approval will help us to speed up our vaccination programme and run more clinics closer to people's homes\".\nWhile Plaid Cymru are \"pleased\" with the second vaccine rollout, health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated and there's far too much variation from region to region - Welsh Government must not allow a postcode lottery.\" \nThe Welsh Conservatives previously criticised the speed of the first vaccine rollout, saying hope had \"dropped away\" for many over 80 who were \"desperately waiting for their appointment\". \nThe rollout of the new vaccine will be another injection of hope at a time when it's so desperately needed.\nAt least 22,000 doses will be available in Wales this week followed at least another 20,000 next week.\nThe hope is then to ramp up its distribution as supplies arrive, so that around 1.5 million people in Wales at greatest risk of getting really ill from Covid, for example older people or those who have long term health conditions,  can get a jab within the next few months.\nBecause it can be stored for much longer in a normal fridge, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to deliver in places like GP surgeries and care homes than the other Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\nGetting both vaccines out is now a race against time."
