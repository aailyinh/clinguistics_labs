      "text": "Extended households and workplaces are behind a rise in Covid cases in Merthyr Tydfil, a health chief has said. \nThe flare-up was down to \"a bit of a loss of discipline\" said Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, director of public health for Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. \nLocalised hotpot Gellideg and Merthyr Town has had 44 cases in the past week, nearly half of those in the local area.\nThe county has a seven-day case rate of 159.1 per 100,000 population compared to the Wales average of 43.3.\nThis was the fourth highest case rate in the UK on Thursday.\nCovid rules currently allow most people to only meet indoors with people they live with.\nMerthyr council has responded by setting up a mobile testing unit at the Swansea Road estate.\nThe hotspot in Gellideg and Town is at a rate of 625.6 per 100,000 for the past seven days, by far the highest of these localised case rates in Wales.\nDr Nnoaham told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: \"We have identified about four different clusters that are largely responsible for the increase in cases that we have had.\n\"We know that a number of workplaces have been involved in this cluster, we know there has been an extended household cluster in one of the areas.\n\"I think we understand exactly why this has happened and I just want to use the opportunity to appeal to people out there that whilst we're making progress in the vaccination programme we're by no means home and dry and we still need to maintain those precautions and be extra vigilant.\"\nHe said the spread was largely down to young people in the area.\n\"When we looked at the age profile of the majority of the cases and these clusters, what we're talking about is largely young people who have not had their vaccination,\" he said. \n\"And secondly, it does appear that the loss of discipline around the social distancing [and] face masks has been more likely in the younger populations.\n\"There's a bit of a loss of discipline that has happened more recently\".\nHe urged people to watch Saturday's Grand Slam between Wales and France at home and not with friends and family.\nOnly those who live alone, are single and live in a house share, single parents, families with babies and 16 and 17-year-olds who do not live with an adult had been able to form a so-called \"support bubble\".\nFour people from two households can meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens.\nThe case rate in Merthyr Tydfil was again the highest case rate in Wales.\nThis is the highest point reached locally in the past six weeks, but still a long way from the levels seen in previous months.\nCases in the area hit a peak of 1,349 per 100,000 on 18 December, two days before Wales was placed under a national lockdown, with the county having the worst case rate in the UK.\nAt the time officials blamed the spike in cases on the \"closeness\" and \"tight-knit\" nature of valleys communities, with people living close to extended family and friends and popping round to check on their neighbours.\nIn an area with high rates of deprivation, there were also concerns about people having to make tough choices between going to work to get paid and isolating if contacted by tracers.\nAt the start of February there was a feeling of hope as case rates fell to some of the lowest in Wales, but there were warnings they could rise again as people became weary of lockdown measures."

      "tags": "Spain,France,Greece,Travel,Ursula von der Leyen,Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A digital certificate to kick-start foreign travel should be given to citizens across the EU \"without discrimination\", officials say.\nThe aim is to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU.\nThe 27 member states will decide how to use the new digital certificate.\nVaccine passports have faced opposition from some EU member states over concerns they might be discriminatory.\nSome argue that they would enable a minority to enjoy foreign travel without restrictions while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face measures such as quarantine. European Commission officials have made clear they want to avoid discrimination.\nAnother issue raised has been that data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete.\nAhead of the EU's announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was working to \"create an international trusted framework\" for safe travel, but that vaccinations should not be a condition. \nSeparately, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has threatened to withhold exporting vaccines to the UK and any other countries outside the EU that do not supply doses in a reciprocal way. \n\"We're still waiting for doses to come from the UK,\" she said. \"So, this is an invitation to show us that there are also doses from the UK coming to the European Union.\" \nSpeaking in Brussels on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed digital green certificate would be \"for all EU citizens, their families when they're leaving the EU or living abroad\". \n\"It'll also be for the European Economic Area (EEA), because we want to work with Norway and Iceland,\" he said, adding that Switzerland would also be involved. \nMr Reynders said there was still a lot to do to put the digital certificate in place, but the aim was to get it up and running before the summer tourist season. \nThe European Commission proposal sets out that any EU member state permitting vaccinated travellers to bypass restrictions such as quarantine must accept certificates from other states within the bloc under the same conditions. \nThe vaccines should be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These currently include drugs developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, but not Russia's Sputnik V or China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. \nHowever, the proposal adds that the guidelines \"should not prevent member states from deciding to accept vaccination certificates issued for other Covid-19 vaccines\".\nMeanwhile, in the UK, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was looking at the idea of vaccine passports and had been \"discussing what the best way to proceed is\".\n\"We are having debates, discussions about travel... but I think what we also have to do is be driven by the data, we've got to see how coronavirus develops,\" he told the BBC.\nMore than a third of the UK population - nearly 25 million people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine in the UK, which is no longer a member of the European Union.\nThe rollout across the EU has been slower, and has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the current suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over fears of possible side effects. \nThe economies of countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy are unlikely to recover until the tourist industry is reopened, and they have been looking at ways to save the summer season while providing a safe environment for both travellers and local residents. \nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Wednesday welcomed the planned certificate, which he said would \"significantly facilitate the movement of citizens and will help boost tourism and the economies that rely heavily on it\".\nLast month, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos said that a common digital certificate was \"not discriminatory\", and that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer - but the procedure for them would be slower as they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival.\nA hotel manager in the Spanish resort of Benidorm, Ricardo S\u00e1nchez, told the BBC that the UK was its most important market, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, and people arriving from Eastern Europe. \n\"So many months working with so many restrictions and the restrictions are changing every 15 days,\" he said, adding that would-be tourists were unsure what to do and were waiting for \"good news\" before booking reservations. \nIceland has said it is opening its borders to visitors who have received the vaccine without the need for testing or quarantine later this week.

      "title": "Covid-19: All NI adults 'still getting Covid jab by end of July'",
      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Health Minister Robin Swann says every adult in Northern Ireland will still get their first vaccine dose by the end of July.\nIt follows an expected reduction in the UK's Covid-19 vaccine supply.\nThat is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMr Swann said officials were doing all they could to ensure any delays to the department's timeline were shortened as much as possible.\nSpeaking on BBC Newsline, Mr Swann said he did not expect any changes to the lifting of Northern Ireland's coronavirus restrictions in light of the vaccine supply.\n\"We don't put dates to anything and I think it's exactly these sorts of unforeseen circumstances that allow us to take that approach,\" he said.\n\"The announcements made on Tuesday in regards to the next phase of lifting restrictions won't be affected by the delay of this supply of vaccine.\n\"I don't think this delay should have an effect on what the executive wants to do in easing further restrictions.\"\nA paper from the Department of Health shows that the R number in Northern Ireland is currently at between 0.9-1.10.\nThe minister said it showed the rate of infection was still decreasing, which meant the executive had been allowed to progress with making some changes to the lockdown regulations.\n\"One of the things we've always been aware of is keeping R below one... considering where we were back in mid-December, early January we are still moving in the right direction,\" he added.\n\"That comes about by the observance of restrictions and regulations but also by greater uptake of the vaccine as well and when we look to the hope that the vaccine brings that will allow us to come out of an incredibly dark time.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme told the Stormont Assembly more Pfizer doses would be used until extra AstraZeneca jabs arrive.\nShe said anyone expecting a second dose or who had already booked their first would have their appointments honoured.\nFirst jabs would continue in April, if at a slightly reduced rate, she added.\nOn Thursday, another Covid-19-related death and 169 new cases of the virus were recorded  in Northern Ireland.\nThere were no coronavirus-related deaths reported in the Irish Republic on Thursday.\nHowever, there were 582 confirmed new cases of the virus in the country.\nVaccine delivery issues could put the rollout plan back by four weeks in a \"worst-case scenario\", Ms Donnelly told Stormont's Health Committee, but the delay was more likely to be about two weeks.\n\"The mitigation measures that we put in place we hope will only delay us by two weeks, so it won't have a huge impact,\" she said.\nIt had been hoped vaccinations would be on offer to all people over the age of 40 when a mass vaccination centre at Belfast's SSE Arena opened on 29 March, but this would likely be delayed by two weeks, said Ms Donnelly.\n\"It will very much depend on the remaining deliveries that we get from AstraZeneca,\" she said.\n\"We have tried to find some mitigation through further use of the Pfizer vaccine. \nMs Donnelly said three of Northern Ireland's five health trusts would now rely mainly on Pfizer doses until more AstraZeneca supplies arrived.\nOn Wednesday, NHS England warned there could be a \"significant reduction\" in the number of doses available in April.\nEarlier, Health Minister Robin Swann said Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout was ahead of schedule and would be able to adapt.\nNews of the UK vaccine shortage was frustrating, if not surprising, said the chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee in Northern Ireland.\n\"The pace of vaccination has depended on the supply from the outset,\" tweeted Dr Alan Stout.\n\"We've done so well, so far, that the vast majority of those people who are at risk have now had their first dose,\" He told The Nolan Show.\n\"If it does mean that the consequences of delaying a first dose to someone we know who is at less risk, then that's going to have to be a decision that's made to protect those second doses.\"\nNorthern Ireland was still on course to meet its target of having most adults vaccinated by June or July, said Justice Minister Naomi Long.\nMeanwhile, more than 300 pharmacies have signed up to be part of the vaccination scheme.\nOfficial launch of the rollout will begin on 30 March, although some pharmacies may start before then.\n\"Their contribution to getting as many people vaccinated as possible will be invaluable,\" said Mr Swann.\nThe chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene, said. \"The accessibility and reach of the community pharmacy network, with pharmacists as skilled vaccinators, means they are well equipped to take part in the vaccine programme.\"\nMr Greene called their inclusion in the programme \"a fantastic and welcome step forward\" and said that this will not affect other pharmacy services.\nCommunity pharmacies were used to having to deal with supply issues, he said, adding that the anticipated drop in vaccine supply was unlikely to undermine Northern Ireland's programme."

      "tags": "US gun violence,Georgia,Asian Americans,Atlanta",
      "text": "A man has been charged with murder over the killing of eight people at massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia.\nOfficials cannot yet confirm if the attack, in which six Asian women were killed, was racially motivated. Four victims were named on Wednesday.\nThe suspect, named as Robert Aaron Long, faces multiple counts of murder as well as aggravated assault.\nCherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect may have been a patron and claimed to have a \"sex addiction\".\nThe attack comes amid a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans.\nFour of the victims have been identified by Cherokee County officials as Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R Hernandez-Ortiz was identified as having been injured.\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, investigators said Mr Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, admitted to the shooting spree, and said that he denied that the attack was motivated by race. \nHe has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department.\n\"He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,\" said Capt Jay Baker, adding that Mr Long was caught with a 9mm handgun and did not resist arrest. \nBut Capt Baker's remarks - that \"yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did\" - came in for widespread criticism for appearing to sympathise with the alleged perpetrator.\nMassage parlours are known to sometimes provide prostitution services, but authorities say there is no indication yet that this is the case at the targeted locations. \n\"These are legally operating businesses that have not been on our radar,\" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who added that the city would not engage in \"victim shaming, victim blaming\".\nPolice also noted it is still too early in the investigation to definitively state a motive and that the suspect appeared to have been acting alone.\nMs Bottoms said that he was on his way to Florida, possibly to commit more shootings, when he was arrested. \nThe suspect's parents helped to identify him, officials told reporters.\nAccording to CBS News, the suspect told investigators that \"he loved God and guns\". \nThe first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County.\nTwo people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded.\nLess than an hour later, police were called to a \"robbery in progress\" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. In the recording of the 911 call released on Wednesday, a woman tells the dispatcher that she's hiding from the assailant. \n\"Do you have a description of the male?\" the operator asks.\n\"We're hiding right now,\" the woman replies. \"They have a gun.\" \n\"Please come, ok?\" she says. \nWhen authorities arrived at the spa, \"officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds\", police said.\nWhile there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead.\nOn a second 911 call, a woman tells the operator that she got a call from a friend who said a man had entered the spa and fired a gun. \n\"They said some guy came in... We heard a gunshot and the lady's passed out in front of the door,\" she says. \"And everybody is scared and everybody is hiding.\" \nInvestigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta.\nAuthorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. \nPolice have only identified the people who were attacked in Cherokee County at this time.\nDetails have been slow to emerge. Here is what we know about the named victims so far.\nAshley Yaun and her husband had gone to Young's Asian Massage for a couples massage, according to an online fundraiser. \nHer husband survived the attack and was unharmed. The couple have two children.\n\"We just don't know how to do any of this alone,\" the GoFundMe page says.\nA GoFundMe for Mr Hernandez-Ortiz, the only victim to survive the attacks, says that he is intensive care after being shot in the forehead, lungs and stomach.\nHis daughter Yoseline, 9, told WGCL-TV that \"he is a really good dad,\" and \"I don't want him to go.\"\nBy Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Washington\nHeartbroken, fearful, angry, fed up. These are some shared feelings of people who showed up at a vigil in Washington DC the night after the shooting.\nAround 100 people marched in Chinatown and lit candles, mourning the eight lives lost in Atlanta - six of them of Asian descent. \nThe authorities have not linked the killing with anti-Asian hate crime. But many here believe the shooting is yet another senseless attack against Asians and Asian-Americans during the pandemic.\n\"It's scary to be an Asian-American woman anywhere in the US,\" an Asian woman told me. She said it was finally time for her to speak up, after being told by her parents to stay silent about racism she experienced while growing up. \nThere's a myth about Asian-Americans being the quiet \"model minority\". But those who attended the vigil, both Asians and non-Asians, spoke loud and clear with a unified voice.\n\"We will not fight racism with racism,\" a Korean-American man spoke to the crowd emotionally, \"We will fight racism with unity!\"\nThough authorities say it is too early to know if the victims were targeted because of their race, many online have criticised a recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, which activists have linked to rhetoric blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders acknowledged a motive was unclear, but said \"right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian American community that must be addressed\".\nIt called the shootings \"an unspeakable tragedy\" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has \"been reeling from high levels of racist attacks\".\n\"A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,\" Mayor Bottoms said in a statement, adding that she had been in communication with the White House.  \nMr Biden tweeted that he and the first lady were \"keeping everyone impacted by the shootings in Atlanta in our prayers\". \n\"We don't yet know the motive, but what we do know is that the Asian-American community is feeling enormous pain tonight. The recent attacks against the community are un-American.  They must stop,\" he said. \nVice-President Kamala Harris, the first Asian-American to hold the office, said during a Wednesday meeting with Irish officials: \"I do want to say to our Asian-American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people.\"\nBen Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: \"Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism.\"\nAtlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked.\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: \"Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,UK economy,Bank of England,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The outlook for the UK economy remains \"unusually uncertain\" despite the rapid rollout of the vaccine programme, the Bank of England has said.\nIt said it expected an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures were eased and government support for jobs continued.\nBut it said the recovery still depended on the \"evolution of the pandemic\" and measures to protect public health.\nIt came as the Bank held interest rates at historic lows of 0.1%.\nAccording to official figures, the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown, as restaurants and non-essential shops were shuttered.\nBut the drop was much smaller than expected, suggesting businesses have adapted to trading in lockdown.\nIt's added to growing expectations that the recovery will be stronger than previously expected, thanks in large part to the vaccine programme. \nDespite concerns about supply, everyone above the age of 50 and all adults in risk groups are set to have their first jab by the end of May, followed by all adults by the end of July.    \nLast week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that he expected the economy to \"get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019\". \nMeanwhile, the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts that unemployment will peak at 6.5% instead of the 11.9% predicted last July. \nHowever, an official statement on Thursday from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, was more cautious. \nIt said recent plans to ease lockdown \"may be consistent with a slightly stronger outlook\" in the near term, but it was unclear whether they would make a difference in the medium-term.\n\"The outlook for the UK economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the pandemic, remains unusually uncertain,\" it added.\n\"It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments.\"\nSilvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes, said the cautious tone of the MPC's statement was in line with other central banks. \n\"The Bank of England is facing the same cross-currents. Since its previous meeting in February, most developments - notably fresh rounds of fiscal stimulus domestically and abroad - have had positive implications for the economic outlook, but downside risks and uncertainty concerning the evolution of the pandemic are still prominent.\"\nThere have been warnings that inflation could breach the Bank's 2% target this year, but Mr Bailey has played the threat down. \nOn Thursday, the MPC said it would continue to monitor the situation closely but had no immediate plans tighten monetary policy. \nBut it said if the outlook for inflation weakens, \"the committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit\".\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve also played down warnings of rising inflation, saying any increases above its own 2% target were likely to be \"transient\". \nToday's Monetary Policy Report plays down the risk of a rate rise any time soon. And the BoE has more than one reason to do so. \nThe pandemic has brought weirdness to many of our lives. The same applies to the Bank of England. It continues to insist it doesn't engage in monetary financing, where the central bank simply creates money from nothing (once upon a time you could say \"prints money\" but now it's digital) and \"lends\" it to the government. \nHowever, what's happening now is not much different. As the Financial Times has noted, of the money being borrowed by the government this financial year by issuing gilts - a sort of IOU note also known as a government bond - 92.7% of it will be owed to the Bank of England. \nNot only is the government \"borrowing\" most of its money from another branch of the public sector. If it pays interest on that debt it gets it straight back. Easy money. But the money the BoE creates from nothing is used to buy gilts from big City players like pension funds, hoping they'll invest the cash in productive industry (the last 12 years by no means supports that hope). \nWhat they get in exchange is BoE reserves, which pay interest at the official rate. So if rates rose, the BoE - underwritten by the Treasury - would be one of the biggest losers. "

      "tags": "Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "The government is to cut grants aimed at encouraging people to buy electric vehicles in a move that has been criticised by the motor industry.\nThe Department for Transport will reduce the grant from \u00a33,000 to \u00a32,500 and restrict it to cars under \u00a335,000.\nBut Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it is \"the wrong move at the wrong time\".\nIt said the decision goes against the government's zero emissions ambitions.\n\"This sends the wrong message to the consumer, especially private customers, and to an industry challenged to meet the government's ambition to be a world leader in the transition to zero emission mobility,\" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.\nFord of Britain said the grant cut was \"disappointing and is not conducive to supporting the zero emissions future we all desire.\"\n\"Robust incentives - both purchase and usage incentives - that are consistent over time are essential if we are to encourage consumers to adopt new technologies,\" the carmaker's chairman Graham Hoare said.\nBusiness group the CBI also criticised the move, saying \"this is the wrong time to stunt a green recovery by making a sudden change to the grants on offer.\"\nMatthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said \"we must avoid sending mixed messages to consumers and businesses.\"\n\"Switching to an electric vehicle still has many barriers, including high upfront costs and availability of reliable charging points. \n \"A clear and consistent pathway for incentives will ensure business can continue to deliver the government's ambitions for reducing transport emissions,\" Mr Fell added.\n'Increasing choice'\nThe government said that higher-priced vehicles are typically bought by drivers who can afford to switch to electric vehicles without a subsidy.\nIt said the changes will allow funding for the grant to go further.\nTransport minister Rachel Maclean said: \"We want as many people as possible to be able to make the switch to electric vehicles.\" \n\"The increasing choice of new vehicles, growing demand from customers, and rapidly rising number of chargepoints means that while the level of funding remains as high as ever, given soaring demand, we are re-focusing our vehicle grants on the more affordable zero emission vehicles.\"\nThe government will also alter how it calculates the plug-in van grant, and change the eligibility for the grant to vehicles that are able to travel for 60 miles without any emissions.\nThe plug-in car grant was introduced a decade ago, and was designed to reduce the price of electric cars, which generally cost more to make than petrol or diesel equivalents, to encourage more people to buy them.\nElectric cars are expensive to make and expensive to buy compared with traditional vehicles.\nThe grant was introduced to reduce the price difference between electric models and conventional cars, to encourage people to buy them. \nThe government's argument is that now battery prices are falling, and with a range of cheaper cars coming onto the market, the size and scope of the grant can be reined in, and the available money can be better spent.\nThe market has certainly changed since the grant was introduced a decade ago. Electric car sales are now rising rapidly and relatively affordable vehicles with a practical range are becoming much more common.\nWith the government now planning to ban the sale of new non-hybrid petrol and diesel cars from 2030, it seems to be relying less on incentives and more on compulsion to bring about change.\nLess carrot and more stick.\nBut the industry believes this approach is wrong and that reducing the grant threatens to choke off the growth in electric car use, at a time when many other countries are offering much bigger subsidies.\nSince 2018, the government has been narrowing the scope of the grant, bringing the level down in stages from \u00a35,000 and tightening the eligibility criteria.\nIt said in 2018 that it wanted to gradually get rid of the grants. In March 2020, it extended the grant schemes for three years with \u00a3582m funding.\nCharging concerns\nSales of electric cars have increased rapidly over the past year, but remain a relatively small proportion of all cars sold.\nThe government says that by 2030 it wants to ban the sale of new cars powered only by petrol or diesel engines.\nAs part of a plan to make the UK carbon neutral, it unveiled a \u00a32.8bn package to support the switch to greener cars, including \u00a31.3bn for charging infrastructure.\nBut in February, the Policy Exchange think tank said the rollout of charging points had fallen behind what was needed to meet the planned ban on diesel and petrol cars.\nIt said there was a risk of \"charging blackspots\" in small towns and rural areas unless the rollout speeds up.\nPrice comparison site Carwow said cutting the subsidy for electric vehicles was a \"strange direction\" for the UK to take.\n\"For the most part, electric vehicle variants still carry a notable price premium versus  traditional petrol or diesel variants,\" said Sepi Arani, commercial lead at Carwow.\n\"The lowering of the cap to \u00a335,000 limits the support to a much smaller proportion of cars, which in turn will no doubt have an effect on the UK's electric vehicle adoption.\n\"It's difficult to see why the grant scheme does not instead work on a tapered scheme, where the amount offered is staggered for different price points instead,\" Mr Arani added."

Apes are strong together.\"\nAccording to KnowYourMeme, WSB types referring to each other as \"apes\" is from the prequel to the Planet of the Apes movies, and the character Caesar's explanation that \"apes together strong\" is a motto which is often repeated in Reddit posts.\nHowever, there's a thread on WSB of some Redditors complaining about the current terminology. \nOthers claim they call themselves the \"ape gang\" because they think of themselves as being like monkeys pressing buttons on a keyboard to buy stocks. Members also frequently use gorilla emojis in their posts. \nThere were around two million members of the community at the start of 2021, increasing to 10 million in March. The \"ape\" term took off with the influx of members, with some Redditors putting the tipping point at around the three million membership.\nAdopting gorillas started on Friday, when a member of the WSB community posted that they had sent a donation to the Dian Fossey Gorilla fund, which allowed them to adopt their own gorilla. \nThe post was upvoted over 112,000 times, with other members of the community following suit to adopt their own gorillas.\nThis is not the first time members of the subreddit have donated to a cause. \nPreviously, people who had gained a lot of money off the back of GameStop had made donations to schools, particularly to buy crayons. \nAlso, another Redditor bought 100 chicken tenders (the running joke being it is a WSB Redditor's favourite food, and 'tendies' is used as a term for the reward/gain from the stock) for their local children's hospital workers with their gains. \nReddit has quite a history of this. The sub r/HydroHomies - celebrating (drinking) water - often has posts up about donations to water charities."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "An expected reduction in the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nThe shipment, produced by the Serum Institute of India, has been held up by four weeks, the BBC has been told.\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for supply issues.\nThe Department of Health insists it is still on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\nNHS England warned of a reduction in supply in April in a letter to local health organisations on Wednesday.\nThe Scottish government said it was \"seeking clarity\" from the UK Vaccine Taskforce on future supplies, while the governments in Wales and Northern Ireland said they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected. \nA spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: \"Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India.\"\nA source told the BBC that although the original aim had been to deliver the next five million in March, there was not a stipulated time for the delivery of the doses.\nMr Jenrick told the BBC that the government had learned of vaccine supply issues \"in the last few days\". \nHe said the UK had less supply of the vaccine \"than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks but we expect it to increase again through the course of April\". \nThe vaccine rollout would be \"slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves\" of offering a first dose to all people aged over 50 by 15 April, and all adults by the end of July, he said.\nAnyone with an appointment for a second jab \"should have complete confidence\" that they will go ahead, he said, adding: \"The month of April will be different - and it was always going to be - because I think this will be the month that second jabs exceed first jabs.\"\nOn Monday NHS sources said there would be a big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming days after the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India.\nProf Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a \"bumper supply\". \nHe said the announcement of a shortage was \"disappointing\" news and it would impact \"the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions\" who would now have to wait until May.\nMore than 25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab.\nAfter opening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee for Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI), said the disruption to supply meant the UK's rollout would be going from \"extremely fast to somewhat less fast\", rather than \"juddering to a halt\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the supply issues could affect infection rates but should not have an impact on hospital admissions, as those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19 were being prioritised for the jab.\nThe Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries.\nIts chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been \"directed to prioritise the huge needs of India\".\nHe has also raised concerns about raw material shortages, attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines, such as specialised bags and filters.\nEarlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks.\nThe rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues.   \nPfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track.\nThe UK has also approved a third vaccine - Moderna, which is due to start being rolled out in late spring. \nMore than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK, including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved.\nPredicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available.\nWhen you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity.\nThe UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast.\nA deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed.\nThe government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down.\nIt comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early.\nThose hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement to MPs in the Commons later on Thursday.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that people \"across the country\" would be \"anxious and worried\" about news of delays.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due on Thursday to release the findings of an investigation into cases of blood clots in a handful of Oxford-AstraZeneca jab recipients.\nSeveral European countries have paused the use of the vaccine but the regulator has said there was \"no indication\" it caused the clots.\nThe World Health Organization has urged countries not to halt vaccinations.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to figures updated on Wednesday from the UK government. A further 5,758 people have tested positive."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland is to get 500,000 fewer vaccine doses over the next month due to UK supply issues.\nHowever, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the country remains on track to meet its targets despite the shortfall.\nUK ministers have faced calls to explain why there would be a significant reduction in incoming vaccines from the end of March. \nIt is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs: \"We expect that over the next month we will have approximately 500,000 fewer doses than we had previously anticipated.\n\"For that reason there may be periods in April where we need to prioritise second doses.\"\nSecond doses should be administered within 12 weeks of a first dose.\nMs Sturgeon added that the government still intends to offer first doses to all people in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) top priority groups by mid-April.\nThis covers everyone aged over 50, unpaid carers and people with underlying health conditions.\nThe first minister said she \"still expects\" to offer a dose to all adults in the population by the end of July.\nShe added: \"We have always known that supplies will be subject to some volatility but the roll-out of the programme overall continues to be really encouraging and it does give us real cause for optimism now about the months ahead.\"\nEarlier, Scotland's national clinical director told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that targets should be met despite a \"significant reduction\" in UK vaccine supplies.\nProfessor Jason Leitch said ministers may have to think about \"who comes next and when they come next\" after April. \nHe added: \"We do not anticipate it will affect our second doses at all because we can prioritise them and just now they are mainly Pfizer.\"\nProf Leitch said there is no suggestion from either Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca that they will not be able to meet their end targets.\nThe national clinical director has made it clear that disruption to the vaccine supply will not affect two key targets.\nAll those over 50 or with underlying health conditions should still get their first jab by mid April, and the whole of the adult population should still be offered a jab by July.\nOne big question is when people in their 40s with no underlying health conditions - who may have been assuming they would be vaccinated in mid to late April - will now get their jab.\nAnother is whether disruption to the supply will have any effect on the easing of lockdown.\nAs the plan was to vaccinate over-50s by mid April and it takes three weeks for someone to get as much protection as one dose offers, it would seem unlikely that there will be any effect on the changes planned for 5 and 26 April.\nBut will progress be sufficient to allow other restrictions to ease in May and June as hoped?\nThe groups who will be vaccinated by mid-April account account for 99% of Covid deaths and the overwhelming majority of hospital admissions.\nBut with a growing amount of evidence that vaccination also reduces transmission, immunising younger people will also play a part in keeping case numbers down and providing even more protection to those most at risk.\nIt will be well worth watching the numbers in the coming weeks.  \nThe UK government said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for the expected slow down.\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC that UK supplies would be lower \"than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks\", but this was expect to increase in April.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said the supply issues meant efforts would focus on the first phase of the programme to vaccinate the over 50s.\nSecond doses for those immunised earlier in the year would also be prioritised\nThe Bristol University academic told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that phase two - to vaccinate the remaining adult population - would move forward when supplies were restored.\nProf Finn said: \"We have seen this in the past with other vaccines. Because they are biological agents rather than straightforward drugs they are more difficult to manufacture at scale.\n\"So we always try and make sure that we have got more than one supplier for vaccination against any particular disease.\"\nProf Finn said the issues should only result in a \"partial interruption\" to UK's vaccination programme and said it remains \"on track\".\nThe Scottish government said that \"appointments will be fulfilled\" for anyone already scheduled to have their first dose or second dose.  \nA spokesman added: \"Supplies of the vaccine have dipped before and our vaccination programme will continue to manage the stock available to get vaccines into arms as fast as possible.\"\nOn Wednesday it was announced that more than two million people in Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine.\nThe Scottish government said the milestone meant that 44% of the eligible population had been reached.\nLatest vaccination figures reveal 2,023,002 had received their first dose of the vaccine - an increase of 41,184 - as of 08:30 on Thursday.\nA total of 192,100 people have so far received a second dose of the vaccine, an increase of 10,221.\nThat means 51,405 received vaccinations on Wednesday."

      "text": "US actor Armie Hammer has been accused of raping a woman in Los Angeles in 2017.\nThe woman, a 24-year-old named only as Effie, made the allegations during a virtual news conference on Thursday.\nHammer, 34, denied the allegations. His lawyer said they were \"outrageous\" and Hammer \"welcomes the opportunity to set the record straight\".\nLos Angeles police told the BBC Hammer was a suspect in a sexual assault investigation opened on 3 February.\nThe accuser broke down while reading a prepared statement about the allegations against Hammer, known for films including The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name.\nShe spoke alongside high-profile women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred, alleging she first met Hammer on Facebook in 2016, when she was 20.\n\"I fell in love with him instantly,\" she said. \nThe woman alleged that, as the relationship progressed, Hammer used \"manipulation tactics in order to exert control over me\".\nShe said he would \"test my devotion to him, finally removing and crossing my boundaries as he became increasingly more violent\".\nThe woman accused the actor of abusing her \"mentally, emotionally and sexually\". \nShe said the alleged rape happened on 24 April, 2017.\nShe said: \"Armie Hammer raped me for over four hours in Los Angeles, during which he repeatedly slapped my head against a wall, bruising my face.\n\"During those four hours, I tried to get away and he wouldn't let me. I thought that he was going to kill me. \n\"He then left with no concern for my wellbeing. I was completely in shock and I couldn't believe that someone I loved did that to me.\" \nShe said she was left suicidal by the alleged rape, adding she felt \"immense guilt\" at not speaking out sooner.\nIn a statement sent to the BBC, Hammer's lawyer Andrew Brettler dismissed the allegations.\nThe lawyer said all of Hammer's relations with the woman had been \"completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory\". \nMr Brettler sent the BBC a screengrab of text messages purported to have been sent by the accuser that contained suggestions of extreme sexual behaviour. He said Hammer had responded to the woman, making it clear that he did not want to maintain that type of relationship with her.  \n\"[Her] attention-seeking and ill-advised legal bid will only make it more difficult for real victims of sexual violence to get the justice they deserve,\" the statement added.\nIn January, Hammer pulled out of a new film, Shotgun Wedding, with American actress and singer Jennifer Lopez after what he described as \"vicious and spurious online attacks against me\".\nHammer's starring role in the action comedy has been recast. He also left The Offer, a drama series about the making of The Godfather.\nHammer and his wife, TV host Elizabeth Chambers, announced their divorce in July 2020. Ms Chambers released a statement last month, saying she supported \"any victim of assault or abuse\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,UK economy,Bank of England,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The outlook for the UK economy remains \"unusually uncertain\" despite the rapid rollout of the vaccine programme, the Bank of England has said.\nIt said it expected an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures were eased and government support for jobs continued.\nBut it said the recovery still depended on the \"evolution of the pandemic\" and measures to protect public health.\nIt came as the Bank held interest rates at historic lows of 0.1%.\nAccording to official figures, the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown, as restaurants and non-essential shops were shuttered.\nBut the drop was much smaller than expected, suggesting businesses have adapted to trading in lockdown.\nIt's added to growing expectations that the recovery will be stronger than previously expected, thanks in large part to the vaccine programme. \nDespite concerns about supply, everyone above the age of 50 and all adults in risk groups are set to have their first jab by the end of May, followed by all adults by the end of July.    \nLast week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that he expected the economy to \"get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019\". \nMeanwhile, the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts that unemployment will peak at 6.5% instead of the 11.9% predicted last July. \nHowever, an official statement on Thursday from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, was more cautious. \nIt said recent plans to ease lockdown \"may be consistent with a slightly stronger outlook\" in the near term, but it was unclear whether they would make a difference in the medium-term.\n\"The outlook for the UK economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the pandemic, remains unusually uncertain,\" it added.\n\"It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments.\"\nSilvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes, said the cautious tone of the MPC's statement was in line with other central banks. \n\"The Bank of England is facing the same cross-currents. Since its previous meeting in February, most developments - notably fresh rounds of fiscal stimulus domestically and abroad - have had positive implications for the economic outlook, but downside risks and uncertainty concerning the evolution of the pandemic are still prominent.\"\nThere have been warnings that inflation could breach the Bank's 2% target this year, but Mr Bailey has played the threat down. \nOn Thursday, the MPC said it would continue to monitor the situation closely but had no immediate plans tighten monetary policy. \nBut it said if the outlook for inflation weakens, \"the committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit\".\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve also played down warnings of rising inflation, saying any increases above its own 2% target were likely to be \"transient\". \nToday's Monetary Policy Report plays down the risk of a rate rise any time soon. And the BoE has more than one reason to do so. \nThe pandemic has brought weirdness to many of our lives. The same applies to the Bank of England. It continues to insist it doesn't engage in monetary financing, where the central bank simply creates money from nothing (once upon a time you could say \"prints money\" but now it's digital) and \"lends\" it to the government. \nHowever, what's happening now is not much different. As the Financial Times has noted, of the money being borrowed by the government this financial year by issuing gilts - a sort of IOU note also known as a government bond - 92.7% of it will be owed to the Bank of England. \nNot only is the government \"borrowing\" most of its money from another branch of the public sector. If it pays interest on that debt it gets it straight back. Easy money. But the money the BoE creates from nothing is used to buy gilts from big City players like pension funds, hoping they'll invest the cash in productive industry (the last 12 years by no means supports that hope). \nWhat they get in exchange is BoE reserves, which pay interest at the official rate. So if rates rose, the BoE - underwritten by the Treasury - would be one of the biggest losers. "

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS in England was ill-prepared for the seismic shock of the Covid pandemic, a hospital chief has said.\nThe service was already running at nearly full capacity with long waits for non-urgent operations even before coronavirus arrived, according to Prof Marcel Levi, the University College London Hospitals trust's chief executive.\nProf Levi leaves his role at the end of March, after four years, to return to his native Holland to become chief scientific adviser to the Dutch government.\nIn a BBC interview, he argues that it could take \"a very long time\" to clear the backlog of routine surgery and procedures which has built up because of cancellations during the pandemic. He says more money will be needed quickly to run weekend and evening sessions in operating theatres.\nProf Levi also believes the most successful responses to the pandemic were those under the control of the NHS - in contrast to those which were run by independent contractors. \n\"If you want to get something done, ask the NHS and don't outsource it to all these private companies,\" he said.\nProf Levi started his job in London having been chairman of the executive board of the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam.  \nA magazine in the Netherlands named him as Dutchman of the year in 2016. He is a practising consultant, and continued seeing patients as well as carrying out his chief executive role.\nHe believes hospitals coped extremely well in the face of intense pressure when infection rates surged during the second wave in early 2021.\n\"I do not think there is any country with such a high number of Covid patients presenting with such a steep rise like we've seen in January and February, that were dealt with in any health system in such a proper way,\" he said. \n\"So I'm very proud of how the NHS behaved and acted with the skill available to provide sufficient hospital care for what patients needed.\"\nHowever, the first wave was a very different story. He says the NHS was not as robust as it should have been, a key factor being that the UK was one of the countries with the lowest number of intensive care beds per 1,000 of population. \n\"You cannot run a healthcare system at the capacity we run the NHS. We are always 95% full, so it's impossible to quickly respond to an emergency situation.\"\nEvery winter with influenza circulating there are peaks in demand, resulting in cancellations of operations because there is not enough intensive care space.\n\"We should have seen that and said this is just flu, what would happen if we had a real pandemic - and then we would probably have been better prepared.\"\nThe same argument applies to routine surgery and procedures: there were already long waiting lists even before the pandemic started.  \nMore than 300,000 patients have waited more than a year in England, but Prof Levi points out they had waited a long time before Covid forced hospitals to postpone operations.\n\"Covid is actually a magnifying glass, making it clear that capacity in the NHS is not sufficient - that has now become very obvious. It's going to take, I am afraid, a very long time to get where we want to be.\"\nProf Levi's comments came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced \u00a36.6 billion extra for health and care in England in the first half of the 2021/22 financial year.  \nMr Hancock told MPs the money was in addition to funding committed as part of the spending review to help the NHS meet additional Covid costs and starting work on the elective recovery.\nProf Levi's analysis makes sobering reading, because he has experience of other health systems, and has seen the front line in the UK with a fresh perspective.  \nBut he also believes that the NHS has many strengths - and takes a swipe at the use of private contractors in some areas of the Covid response.\n\"Everything that has been a big success - addressing these massive peaks for patients needing intensive care and also vaccination - was the part done by the NHS. \n\"Everything that was actually not so successful - test-and-trace, PPE provision, all these things - was outsourced to companies which failed to deliver what they promised. \n\"That is a reminder for the future - the NHS is a very strong organisation. If you want to get something done ask the NHS and not outsource it to all these private companies.\"\nAnd the best thing about the NHS? The people who work in it, he said.\n\"The resilience and the quality and the camaraderie of people I have been working with -  doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, cleaners, teamwork - that's something I have never encountered before.\""

      "tags": "John Magufuli,Tanzania",
      "text": "Tanzania's President John Magufuli has died aged 61, the country's vice-president has announced.\nHe died on Wednesday from heart complications at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, Samia Suluhu Hassan said in an address on state television.\nMr Magufuli had not been seen in public for more than two weeks, and rumours had been circulating about his health.\nOpposition politicians said last week that he had contracted Covid-19, but this has not been confirmed.\nMr Magufuli was one of Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptics, and called for prayers and herbal-infused steam therapy to counter the virus.\n\"It is with deep regret that I inform you that today... we lost our brave leader, the president of the Republic of Tanzania, John Pombe Magufuli,\" Vice-President Hassan said in the announcement.\nShe said there would be 14 days of national mourning and flags would fly at half mast.\nAccording to Tanzania's constitution, Ms Hassan will be sworn in as the new president within 24 hours and should serve the remainder of Mr Magufuli's five-year term which he began last year.\nMr Magufuli was last seen in public on 27 February, but Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa insisted last week that the president was \"healthy and working hard\".\nHe blamed the rumours of the president's ill-health on \"hateful\" Tanzanians living abroad.\nBut opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that his sources had told him Mr Magufuli was being treated in hospital for coronavirus in Kenya.\nWhen Covid-19 arrived in Tanzania, Mr Magufuli called on people to go to churches and mosques to pray. \"Coronavirus, which is a devil, cannot survive in the body of Christ... It will burn instantly,\" he said. \nHe declared Tanzania \"Covid-19 free\" last June, saying the virus had been eradicated by three days of national prayer. \nHe also mocked the efficacy of masks, expressed doubts about testing, and teased neighbouring countries which imposed health measures to curb the virus.\n\"Countries in Africa will be coming here to buy food in the years to come\u2026 they will be suffering because of shutting down their economy,\" he said, according to the Associated Press. \nTanzania has not published details of its coronavirus cases since May, and the government has refused to purchase vaccines.\nOn Monday, police said they had arrested four people on suspicion of spreading rumours on social media that the president was ill.\n\"To spread rumours that he's sick smacks of hate,\" Mr Majaliwa said at the time.\nAnalysis by Athuman Mtulya, BBC News, Dar es Salaam\nThe country is in a sombre mood - for the first time in its six decades of existence, Tanzania has lost a sitting president, John Pombe Magufuli.\nThe news of his death was received with shock and disbelief - although there were rumours of his illness, the authorities reassured the country that all was well with him. \nFrom his home district of Chato to the capital of Dodoma to the business hub of Dar es Salaam, most Tanzanians have been mourning Magufuli. \nThere are those with a different view, especially on social media led by exiled opposition politician Tundu Lissu, who has been speculating that President Magufuli had contracted Covid which led to his death, however the authorities have insisted the death was caused by heart complications. \nTanzanians are now turning their minds to the succession, which should see current Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan become the country's first female president. \nMr Magufuli was declared president on his 56th birthday in October 2015. He was elected for a second term following a disputed poll last year.\nHe was hailed for his anti-corruption stance during his time in office, but he was also accused of cracking down on dissent and curtailing certain freedoms.\nHis critics agree that Mr Magufuli contributed to Tanzania's development. He invested in large infrastructure projects such as a standard-gauge railway to connect the country with its neighbours, major highways, and a bus system in the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam. \nHe also increased electricity production, reducing the need for power rationing.\nBut it is his approach to Covid-19 that many analysts say will define his legacy. \nIn Tanzania, people have reacted with grief and disbelief to the news of Mr Magufuli's death.\nOne, Joseph Petro, told the BBC he thought Mr Magufuli was a \"caring\" leader, adding \"he was helping people in one way or another\".\n\"I am really pained. I am personally pained,\" he said. \nAnother, Illuminata Abel, offered similar sentiments: \"He was not my relative, but he was someone who listened to people's problems, and he was down to earth.\"\nAfrican leaders have also come out to pay tribute.\nKenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said: \"I have lost a friend, colleague and visionary ally,\" and declared a seven-day period of national mourning in Kenya.\nFormer Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called Mr Magufuli a \"partner in democracy\" and a \"patriot who loved his country\".\nBut Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that Mr Magufuli's \"politics, policies and Covid denialism\" had \"driven the country towards disaster\"."

      "text": "Australians have derided a suggestion by the New South Wales (NSW) police commissioner that an app could be used to register sexual consent.\nOn Thursday, Mick Fuller championed the idea of an app where people could digitally record their mutual agreement to have sex.\nHe said the technology could be used to establish \"positive consent\". \nBut many people have criticised the proposal as short-sighted and potentially open to abuse. \nConcerns have also been raised about whether it could be used for state surveillance.\nIn recent weeks, Australians have reignited a national discussion about sexual assault, abuse and harassment of women, and on Monday tens of thousands of people around the nation marched in protest. \nNSW Police, in introducing the app idea on Thursday, said it was aimed at normalising the act of seeking explicit consent.\n\"You may have a son or a brother and you think this is too challenging but this app... protects everybody,\" Commissioner Mick Fuller told the Nine Network.\nHe said the need to prove explicit consent was a consistent problem in sexual assault court cases, and that an app's record could help achieve better legal outcomes for victims. He added that the idea had been raised with the NSW government.\nLess than 10% of the near 15,000 sexual assault cases reported to NSW police last year resulted in police charges, he said.\n\"It needs to be positive consent. How do we do that in this day and age? One option is with technology,\" he wrote in Sydney newspaper The Daily Telegraph.\nBut women's advocates have pointed out that the app's use in reality could pose many problems. They said a consent record could be superseded simply if someone changed their mind, or it could be faked.\n\"The abuser can simply coerce the victim to use the app,\" tweeted the head of the state's domestic violence service Women's Safety NSW.\nFemale lawmakers also criticised the app as inadequate compared to efforts to improve sexual assault laws for victims, and improve awareness.\n\"We need consent law reform, we need holistic education, we need to stop men feeling they are entitled to whatever they want... WE DO NOT NEED AN APP!!\" tweeted Greens MP Jenny Leong.\nA similar app by a private company was released in Denmark earlier this year after the country criminalised sex without explicit consent, but it was widely panned by the public and press.\nAustralia has in recent weeks seen a raft of publicly-aired sexual assault allegations which have centred on its parliament, as well as schools and workplaces.\nIn NSW a schoolgirls' campaign is also lobbying for the school curriculum to be updated on sexual consent. \nThousands of young women have detailed their experience of sexual assault during their schooling years - with many noting they weren't certain of what constituted rape."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "An expected reduction in the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nThe shipment, produced by the Serum Institute of India, has been held up by four weeks, the BBC has been told.\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for supply issues.\nThe Department of Health insists it is still on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\nNHS England warned of a reduction in supply in April in a letter to local health organisations on Wednesday.\nThe Scottish government said it was \"seeking clarity\" from the UK Vaccine Taskforce on future supplies, while the governments in Wales and Northern Ireland said they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected. \nA spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: \"Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India.\"\nA source told the BBC that although the original aim had been to deliver the next five million in March, there was not a stipulated time for the delivery of the doses.\nMr Jenrick told the BBC that the government had learned of vaccine supply issues \"in the last few days\". \nHe said the UK had less supply of the vaccine \"than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks but we expect it to increase again through the course of April\". \nThe vaccine rollout would be \"slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves\" of offering a first dose to all people aged over 50 by 15 April, and all adults by the end of July, he said.\nAnyone with an appointment for a second jab \"should have complete confidence\" that they will go ahead, he said, adding: \"The month of April will be different - and it was always going to be - because I think this will be the month that second jabs exceed first jabs.\"\nOn Monday NHS sources said there would be a big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming days after the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India.\nProf Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a \"bumper supply\". \nHe said the announcement of a shortage was \"disappointing\" news and it would impact \"the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions\" who would now have to wait until May.\nMore than 25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab.\nAfter opening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee for Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI), said the disruption to supply meant the UK's rollout would be going from \"extremely fast to somewhat less fast\", rather than \"juddering to a halt\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the supply issues could affect infection rates but should not have an impact on hospital admissions, as those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19 were being prioritised for the jab.\nThe Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries.\nIts chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been \"directed to prioritise the huge needs of India\".\nHe has also raised concerns about raw material shortages, attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines, such as specialised bags and filters.\nEarlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks.\nThe rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues.   \nPfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track.\nThe UK has also approved a third vaccine - Moderna, which is due to start being rolled out in late spring. \nMore than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK, including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved.\nPredicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available.\nWhen you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity.\nThe UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast.\nA deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed.\nThe government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down.\nIt comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early.\nThose hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement to MPs in the Commons later on Thursday.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that people \"across the country\" would be \"anxious and worried\" about news of delays.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due on Thursday to release the findings of an investigation into cases of blood clots in a handful of Oxford-AstraZeneca jab recipients.\nSeveral European countries have paused the use of the vaccine but the regulator has said there was \"no indication\" it caused the clots.\nThe World Health Organization has urged countries not to halt vaccinations.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to figures updated on Wednesday from the UK government. A further 5,758 people have tested positive."

      "title": "Covid-19: PM says no change to roadmap, and EU agency says vaccine safe",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nGiving a coronavirus update at Downing Street this evening, the PM said the country is currently on track to ease restrictions and allow people to see loved ones and return to pubs and restaurants. \"Our progress along the road to freedom continues unchecked\", he said, but added that easing restrictions on 12 April is dependent on four tests (including progress of the vaccination rollout programme) being met. Boris Johnson says he is getting his first dose of the AstraZeneca jab tomorrow and urged people to get their vaccine when invited.\nDelays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply will not affect people getting their second doses or have an impact on the roadmap out of lockdown, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. NHS England had warned of a reduction in supply in April in a letter sent to local health organisations this week. That is due to a delayed shipment from India, Mr Hancock said, adding that another batch of 1.7 million doses was held up because it had to be retested. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the country remains on track to meet its targets despite the fact it is to get 500,000 fewer doses over the next month due to the supply issues. \nA review by the EU's medicines regulator has concluded the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is \"safe and effective\", and its benefits outweigh the risks. It comes after 13 EU states decided to suspend use of the vaccine amid concerns about blood clots. But the European Medicines Agency (EMA) found the vaccine was not associated with a higher risk of clots. It is going to continue studying the possibility of such links. The World Health Organization has urged countries to continue using the vaccine. The UK medicines regulator has also said there is no evidence the vaccine causes clots.\nThe outlook for the UK economy remains \"unusually uncertain\" despite the rapid rollout of the vaccine programme, the Bank of England has said. It expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it said the recovery still depends on the \"evolution of the pandemic\" and measures to protect public health. It comes as the Bank held interest rates at historic lows of 0.1%. \nFor those who thought that lockdown would leave couples with little else to do than procreate, there was a surprise - not a baby boom but a baby bust. Research shows that the US is facing the biggest slump in births in a century and in parts of Europe the decline is even steeper. For those who study population the baby bust was not a revelation. \"Having seen how bad the pandemic was I'm not surprised,\" says Philip N Cohen, professor of sociology at the University of Maryland. \"But it is still just shocking to see something like this happen in real time.\" Read more here.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Robert Buckland",
      "text": "Plans to change how government decisions are challenged in the courts have been announced by the justice secretary.\nRobert Buckland says the move is to \"protect\" judges from being drawn in to politics and to \"strike the right balance\" between public scrutiny and the \"need for effective government\".\nIt comes after an independent review into the issue.\nLabour says it is an attempt to \"trample on values we all hold dear\". \nLast year, the prime minister ordered a review into the relationship between the government and the courts.\nThe review was headed by the independent peer, Lord Faulks. The Ministry of Justice said the review found \"courts were increasingly considering the merits of government decisions themselves, instead of how those decisions were made - moving beyond the remit of judicial review\".\nJudicial review is a procedure that allows anyone who has been affected by a decision or a failure to act by a public authority to apply to the courts to rule whether its actions were lawful or not.\nRecently, there have been high profile challenges to the government's management of the Brexit process by the Remain campaigner, Gina Miller.\nAddressing MPs, Mr Buckland said while judicial review was an \"important\" and \"vital\" check on power, reforming the process would \"protect\" judges from being dragged into issues beyond their remit. \nMr Buckland said ministers were considering putting a set of rules in place that would \"clearly delineate\" which issues the courts could rule on and which they could not. \nHe said the reforms would \"restore a more sensible balance of responsibilities between Parliament and the courts\".\nJudicial review helps the public hold power to account because it allows any of us to ask a judge to scrutinise a decision by a minister or public body, where we have an arguable case that they've acted unlawfully. \nRecent cases have led to improvements in NHS critical care guidelines during the pandemic - and the Supreme Court declaring that Boris Johnson unlawfully shut down Parliament.\nHis 2019 election manifesto promised to curtail judicial review to prevent judges taking political decisions. \nCritics say JR currently allows judges to retake political decisions about how a policy should operate. \nBut the government's own review panel found some of the most controversial cases have only come about because the courts had to step in to clarify the law, after Parliament had failed to do so.\nGina Miller, who brought one of the two cases against Parliament's shutdown said the public had to ask themselves whether they felt comfortable placing all their trust in politicians, or whether they preferred independent courts to continue to act as a defence against potential abuses by the executive.\nThe shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, accused the government of trying to impose \"new limits\" on judicial reviews.\nHe said it was an attempt to \"trample on values we all hold dear - including fairness, accountability and the rule of law\".\n\"Judicial review is the only mechanism by which members of the public can challenge the government and public bodies when they break the law,\" he added. \nA type of court case that allows members of the public to challenge the legality of a government decision.\nNote 19 May 2021: This story was amended to make clear that the quote assessing the review came from the Ministry of Justice.

The group were on their way to a tournament in Thousand Oaks where Bryant had been set to coach.\nThe fatal crash prompted a global outpouring of support for the NBA star and his family  as well as a number of lawsuits.\nMrs Bryant has also sued the estate of the pilot, Mr Zobayan, and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and wrongful death. Families of the other victims sued the helicopter companies,  but not Mr Zobayan's estate.\nCalifornia now has a state law prohibiting first responders from taking unauthorised pictures of people who died at the scene of an accident or crime."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "Individuals' human rights may have been breached in more than 500 cases where \"do not resuscitate\" decisions were made during the Covid pandemic, the care watchdog for England has said.\nSome 508 'do not attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) decisions made since March 2020 were not agreed in discussion with the person or their family, a report found.\nThe Care Quality Commission is calling for improvements to care planning.\nAn NHS spokesman said decisions should be made in consultation with families.\nThe CQC has recommended that a ministerial oversight group be created to work with health and care providers, local government and the voluntary sector to deliver improvements.\nIt wants to see a consistent national approach to advance care planning, with staff training, accessible information for families and records of conversations and decisions agreed.\nThe findings come after the CQC was asked by the Department of Health and Social Care to conduct a rapid review of how DNAR decisions were used at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt followed concerns that decisions were being made without the involvement of patients or relatives, and that they were being applied in a blanket way to particular groups - to people with learning disabilities, for example.\nAn interim report published by the care watchdog in December found that doctors may have made \"do not resuscitate\" decisions on a blanket basis in the first wave of the pandemic.\nAn NHS spokesman said: \"The NHS has repeatedly instructed local clinicians and services that the blanket DNA(CPR) decisions would be unacceptable - including on three separate occasions in less than a month at the start of the pandemic, and again last week - and that access to treatment and care for people should be and is made on an individual basis in consultation with family and carers.\"\nDNAR orders refer to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\n'Worrying picture'\nIn its latest report, the CQC said that a combination of \"unprecedented pressure\" on providers and \"rapidly developing guidance\" may have led to situations where DNAR decisions were incorrectly conflated with other clinical assessments.\nThere were examples of good practice but the regulator also found a \"worrying picture\" of poor involvement of people using services, poor record keeping, and a lack of oversight and scrutiny of the decisions being made.\nHowever, it noted that the issues raised - such as the need for proper, consistent processes around timely conversations about people's care - pre-dated the pandemic.\nThe report includes evidence from seven Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), responses from adult social care providers, a public survey and voluntary sector organisations.\nSome 2,048 adult social care providers responded to the CQC, and said that 508 DNAR decisions made since 17 March 2020 had not been agreed in discussion with the person, their relative or carer.\nAround a third (180) were still in place in December.\nAnd, while responsibility for making DNAR decisions does not largely rest with adult social care providers, 119 providers said people in their care had been subject to blanket DNAR decisions since March 2020.\nThe CQC said the figures raised concerns about whether the providers making these decisions were at risk of breaching the Equality Act 2010.\nMost providers of adult social care, and primary and secondary care, said they were not aware of inappropriate DNAR decisions.\nBut other stakeholders, service users, families and carers said blanket DNAR decisions had been proposed locally.\nThe regulator heard evidence that these decisions were \"quickly challenged and retracted\".\nRosie Benneyworth, chief inspector of Primary Medical Services and Integrated Care at the CQC, said: \"It is vital we get this right and ensure better end-of-life care as a whole health and social care system, with health and social care providers, local government and the voluntary sector working together.\n\"Covid-19 has brought this to the fore but these are not new issues.\"\nAge UK said the approach to advance care planning needed a \"complete overhaul\", with strengthened support for professionals and families with concerns.\nIt is also calling for a review so that any \"hasty, ill-informed decisions\" could be removed from older people's records.\nMeanwhile, Dan Scorer, head of policy at the learning disability charity Mencap, said the review highlighted \"the urgent need for better staff training and support to ensure the right of people with a learning disability, and their families, to be involved in decisions about care and treatment is upheld\"."

      "tags": "Human rights,Egypt,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A court in Egypt has sentenced the prominent human rights activist Sanaa Seif to 18 months in jail after finding her guilty of \"spreading false news\".\nSeif was detained in June as she tried to file a complaint about an assault that she had allegedly suffered.\nProsecutors later accused her of making unfounded claims about the handling of Covid-19 outbreaks in Egyptian prisons. \nAmnesty International said she had been convicted \"on bogus charges stemming purely from her peaceful criticism\".\nPresident Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since leading the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013 following protests against his rule.\nSanaa Seif is the daughter of the late human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif al-Islam and the Cairo University professor and veteran activist Laila Soueif. Her brother is Alaa Abdel Fattah, an influential blogger and activist who has been imprisoned since September 2019.\nThe 27-year-old, who had already been jailed in connection with two other cases since 2014, was detained on 23 June outside the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cairo. She had been trying to report a physical assault the day before, according to Amnesty International.\nThe rights group said Sanaa Seif had been waiting outside the Tora prison complex for a letter from her brother along with her mother and her sister Mona when a group of women beat them with sticks and stole some of their belongings. One police officer reportedly pushed her mother towards the assailants, it added.\nProsecutors subsequently accused Sanaa Seif of disseminating \"false news on the deterioration of the country's health situation, and the spread of the coronavirus in prisons\", as well as \"misusing social media\" and insulting a police officer.\nAfter Covid-19 reached Egypt, she accused prison authorities of mishandling outbreaks. Human Rights Watch documented several suspected outbreaks at prisons and police stations between last March and July, during which time it believes at least 14 prisoners died of Covid-19 complications.\nOn Wednesday, Mona Seif said her sister had been convicted and sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison.\n\"Sisi's Egypt is a nightmare. He is intent on wasting their lives and health in prison #FreeSanaa #FreeAlaa,\" she wrote on Facebook.\nLast week, the US and 30 other countries issued a joint declaration expressing deep concern about the human rights situation in Egypt. \nIt highlighted \"restrictions on freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly, the constrained space for civil society and political opposition, and the application of terrorism legislation against peaceful critics\".\nThe Egyptian foreign ministry said it completely rejected the statement, which it said was astonishing and included \"claims based on inaccurate information\"."

Perhaps it's less fixed desks and more casual meeting areas, and we need to consider colleague wellbeing, too,\" he said.\nHowever, he emphasised that plans to sell Waterside were still at a very early stage. It is thought the airline has only recently hired property consultants to evaluate options.\nIn a separate statement to the BBC, BA said on Thursday: \"The global pandemic has shown us that many of our colleagues enjoy working remotely and want to continue, and this has accelerated our approach to offering more agile and flexible ways of working.\n\"Our aim is to find a hybrid working model that suits our business, blending the best of office and remote working for our people. We've also re-structured our business to emerge from the crisis and are considering whether we still have the need for such a large headquarters building.\"\nThe move to hybrid working after the pandemic is growing. \nThe Nationwide building society has indicated that it does not intend to force people to return to the office if they have been successfully able to work from home during the pandemic.\nOil giant BP has told office-based staff they can spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease.\nAnd banks HSBC and Lloyds are among many other companies looking into split working arrangements. \nEarlier this month the boss of IWG, which provides office space across the world, told the BBC he expected hybrid working \"to become the norm\" for many companies.\nMark Dixon said: \"It works for companies, because it's a lot cheaper. It's also much, much better for the environment.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS has warned of a \"significant reduction in the weekly supply\" of Covid vaccines in England next month in a letter to local health organisations.\nThe letter says there has been a \"reduction in national inbound vaccines supply\" and asks organisations to \"ensure no further appointments are uploaded\" to booking systems in April.\nThe health secretary said it was a \"standard\" letter.\nThe BBC understands no-one who has booked a vaccine should lose a slot. \nAsked about it during a Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said the NHS regularly sent out \"technical letters\" that explained the \"ups and downs\" of supply.\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there would be fewer AstraZeneca vaccines than expected because of issues with the company's international supply. \nBBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood that the vaccine supply issue related to a consignment from a manufacturer in India, with half of the order delayed by four weeks.\nA spokesperson for the AstraZeneca said: \"Our UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule.\" \nWe were always warned supply was fragile - and these developments are a reminder of that.\nThe UK has its own plants that are supplying one to two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine each week. \nThere are also stocks coming from Pfizer's Belgium plant - these would be the ones that would be susceptible to any restrictions on exports the EU is threatening.\nThe Indian supplies were supposed to give the UK the \"bumper\" end to March, allowing the government to push ahead with vaccination of the under-50s within weeks.\nThis has now been put on hold, given significant numbers will need their second doses from the start of next month.\nThe government is still on track to hit its target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July. \nBy late Spring the first doses of Moderna - the third vaccine to have been approved in the UK - should start arriving.\nBut the delay to the second shipment from India means rollout is going to take a little longer than hoped at the start of this week.\nThe letter from the NHS in England says that \"over this next period it is vital\" that health organisations focus on vaccinating those in the priority groups one to nine, who are most vulnerable to coronavirus. \nIt advises vaccination services to work with local authorities, voluntary community and faith organisations \"to put in place reserve lists\" of people eligible for the vaccine - as well as targeting areas of lower uptake. \nThe NHS says vaccination centres and community pharmacy-led services should close unfilled bookings from the week commencing 29 March.\nEarlier, it was announced that almost half of British adults have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - more than 25 million people.\nAround 1.7 million people have also had a second dose.\nDuring Wednesday's briefing, Mr Hancock said the UK was \"ahead of schedule\" to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April.\nHe also reiterated a commitment to ensuring that all adults in the UK are offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\nSpeaking alongside the health secretary, Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said \"every day we vaccinate more people we are preventing more deaths\".\nAnd England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was \"no evidence\" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine causes an \"increased risk\" of blood clots.\nThe EU's medicines regulator has said it remains \"firmly convinced\" that the benefits of the  jab outweigh the risks, after several leading EU states paused their rollouts.\nProf Van-Tam added that all medicines have both side effects and benefits, and listed some of the rare side effects of paracetamol as examples, pointing out that most people had no issue with taking it.\nBBC politics correspondent Jonathan Blake said the hold-up would have an impact on the momentum of the vaccine rollout and possibly the government's targets.\nLabour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that people \"across the country\" would be \"anxious and worried\" about the news of delays.\n\"Matt Hancock must explain what the issue is with supply and what efforts are being made to resolve them,\" he added.\nOn Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that if Covid vaccine supplies in Europe do not improve, the EU \"will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate\".\nThe EU and the UK have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the export of the vaccines, exacerbated by post-Brexit disagreements.\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Hancock confirmed that shielding guidance in England would end on 31 March - meaning that more than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard. A further 5,758 people have tested positive."

      "text": "Countries around the world are celebrating St Patrick's Day on Wednesday, with online events replacing traditional parades.\nLandmarks across the globe turned green for the day in honour of Ireland's patron saint.\nLarge gatherings were ruled out in many parts of the world due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin were cancelled for the second year in a row.\nHowever events marking the day took place across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which are being streamed online.\nThey included an online disco and live music events in Belfast, while more than 100 online events were held in the Republic of Ireland and broadcast around the world.\nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition continued this year, albeit virtually. \nThe bowl was placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders discussed, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.\nThey might not have been in the same room but President Biden and the taoiseach were still able to virtually wish each other a Happy Saint Patrick's Day.\nIt was a day of a firsts - a first for Joe Biden as president who pledged his support for the Good Friday Agreement.\nReferring to the Good Friday Agreement he said: \"We strongly support y and think it is critically important that we maintain it. The political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples.\"\nAnd it was also Mr Martin's first St Patrick's Day as taoiseach.\nHe said he wanted to move forward with a \"positive relationship with the UK.\"\n\"That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. \n\"That in turn then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island - goals I know you support,\" he added.\nNorthern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers also held a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. \nA range of issues were covered during the meeting including progress on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery, as well as highlighting regional strengths and priorities.\nMichelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster Ministers also expressed hope that President Biden and Vice President Harris would visit Northern Ireland at some point in the future.\nHundreds of extra police officers were on duty in Northern Ireland for a \"robust\" response to St Patrick's Day rule breakers.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster had warned that St Patrick's Day \"must be different\" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Garda\u00ed (police) had a significant operation in place to deal with planned protests in Dublin city centre. \nSixteen people were arrested in the city for failing to comply with directions from garda to abide by Covid-19 regulations.\nThe Queen extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as 10 years ago.\"\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, with a record number of places taking part.\nSome 690 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nAlongside more famous landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Leaning Tower of Pisa were more quirky ones such as an abandoned sauna tilted on its side beside a lake in Finland, and a solar power-generated giraffe in Mozambique.\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River but the city's mayor decided to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nSt Patrick lived in the 5th Century and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nSt Patrick's Day started as a religious feast to celebrate his work, but it has grown to be an international festival of all things Irish."

      "text": "The former operator of a theme park has been fined \u00a31m after a girl died on a ride, but the penalty will never be paid as it is in administration.\nEvha Jannath, 11, was on the Splash Canyon rapids ride at Drayton Manor during a school trip in May 2017 when she was \"propelled\" into the water.\nEvha, who could not swim, fell from the boat at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire, when it hit a barrier.\nIn 2019 an inquest jury concluded she died accidentally.\nDuring a sentencing hearing at Stafford Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Spencer said: \"This was an utterly tragic waste of a young life.\"\nHe added there was \"no prospect of the fine being paid\" given the company operating the park at the time had since gone into administration.\nThe park has been sold to Looping Group, which runs attractions in Europe and the UK including West Midland Safari Park and Pleasurewood Hills.  \n\"It is important that lessons are learned and the seriousness of the defendant company's failing in this case is marked by an appropriate punishment,\" Mr Justice Spencer said.\nDrayton Manor Park Ltd previously admitted a breach under Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act, after the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) brought the prosecution.\nThe park had a history of failings on the same ride before the death of Evha, from Leicester, the court was told during the two-day hearing. \nAt the start of the hearing on Wednesday, James Puzey, barrister for the HSE, told the judge the accident had happened \"in context of the systemic failures of safety on this ride\".\n\"The control measures they had were failing every day,\" he added.\nBetween 2011-2013, park records show there were four instances of people falling into the water at the ride before it was closed following Evha's death.\nOne of the incidents was in 2013, when 10-year-old Patrick Treacy fell into the Splash Canyon attraction and had to be rescued by a member of the public.\nEvha, who was on an end-of-year school trip with Jameah Girls Academy, was unsupervised on the ride and at times, along with other pupils, was standing up.\nMr Justice Spencer said: \"The public and Evha's family must not be led to think that this serious offence, which resulted in the death of a child, can properly be met by only a nominal [financial] penalty.\n\"In my judgment it would be wholly inappropriate to do other than impose the fine which the offence merited,\" he added.\n\"No sentence of the court can begin to reflect the tragedy of this case for Evha's family.\"\nVictim impact statements from Evha's father and brother were not read out to the court but Mr Puzey spoke of the \"devastating impact\" on Evha's family.\n\"She was a bright and promising student who had spoken of wanting to become a teacher herself,\" he said.\nThe former Leicester East MP Keith Vaz, who has supported Evha's family, said they had gone through \"torture\" and that \"lessons need to be learned\".\n\"No-one has lost their jobs as a result of this, the company will not pay this fine, no individual has said they are responsible, but there remains a hole in the heart of the family,\" he added. \nSpeaking after the hearing, HSE principal inspector Lyn Spooner said Evha died \"at the end of what should have been a fun day out\".\nMs Spooner added: \"The risks from ejection from the raft had been evident to Drayton Manor for some time, yet they still failed to take the action that could have prevented Evha's death.\"\nRichard Matthews QC, representing Drayton Manor Park Ltd, told the hearing the park had co-operated with the HSE investigation fully and had no previous convictions.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Spain,France,Greece,Travel,Ursula von der Leyen,Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A digital certificate to kick-start foreign travel should be given to citizens across the EU \"without discrimination\", officials say.\nThe aim is to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU.\nThe 27 member states will decide how to use the new digital certificate.\nVaccine passports have faced opposition from some EU member states over concerns they might be discriminatory.\nSome argue that they would enable a minority to enjoy foreign travel without restrictions while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face measures such as quarantine. European Commission officials have made clear they want to avoid discrimination.\nAnother issue raised has been that data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete.\nAhead of the EU's announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was working to \"create an international trusted framework\" for safe travel, but that vaccinations should not be a condition. \nSeparately, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has threatened to withhold exporting vaccines to the UK and any other countries outside the EU that do not supply doses in a reciprocal way. \n\"We're still waiting for doses to come from the UK,\" she said. \"So, this is an invitation to show us that there are also doses from the UK coming to the European Union.\" \nSpeaking in Brussels on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed digital green certificate would be \"for all EU citizens, their families when they're leaving the EU or living abroad\". \n\"It'll also be for the European Economic Area (EEA), because we want to work with Norway and Iceland,\" he said, adding that Switzerland would also be involved. \nMr Reynders said there was still a lot to do to put the digital certificate in place, but the aim was to get it up and running before the summer tourist season. \nThe European Commission proposal sets out that any EU member state permitting vaccinated travellers to bypass restrictions such as quarantine must accept certificates from other states within the bloc under the same conditions. \nThe vaccines should be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These currently include drugs developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, but not Russia's Sputnik V or China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. \nHowever, the proposal adds that the guidelines \"should not prevent member states from deciding to accept vaccination certificates issued for other Covid-19 vaccines\".\nMeanwhile, in the UK, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was looking at the idea of vaccine passports and had been \"discussing what the best way to proceed is\".\n\"We are having debates, discussions about travel... but I think what we also have to do is be driven by the data, we've got to see how coronavirus develops,\" he told the BBC.\nMore than a third of the UK population - nearly 25 million people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine in the UK, which is no longer a member of the European Union.\nThe rollout across the EU has been slower, and has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the current suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over fears of possible side effects. \nThe economies of countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy are unlikely to recover until the tourist industry is reopened, and they have been looking at ways to save the summer season while providing a safe environment for both travellers and local residents. \nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Wednesday welcomed the planned certificate, which he said would \"significantly facilitate the movement of citizens and will help boost tourism and the economies that rely heavily on it\".\nLast month, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos said that a common digital certificate was \"not discriminatory\", and that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer - but the procedure for them would be slower as they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival.\nA hotel manager in the Spanish resort of Benidorm, Ricardo S\u00e1nchez, told the BBC that the UK was its most important market, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, and people arriving from Eastern Europe. \n\"So many months working with so many restrictions and the restrictions are changing every 15 days,\" he said, adding that would-be tourists were unsure what to do and were waiting for \"good news\" before booking reservations. \nIceland has said it is opening its borders to visitors who have received the vaccine without the need for testing or quarantine later this week.

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Health Minister Robin Swann says every adult in Northern Ireland will still get their first vaccine dose by the end of July.\nIt follows an expected reduction in the UK's Covid-19 vaccine supply.\nThat is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMr Swann said officials were doing all they could to ensure any delays to the department's timeline were shortened as much as possible.\nSpeaking on BBC Newsline, Mr Swann said he did not expect any changes to the lifting of Northern Ireland's coronavirus restrictions in light of the vaccine supply.\n\"We don't put dates to anything and I think it's exactly these sorts of unforeseen circumstances that allow us to take that approach,\" he said.\n\"The announcements made on Tuesday in regards to the next phase of lifting restrictions won't be affected by the delay of this supply of vaccine.\n\"I don't think this delay should have an effect on what the executive wants to do in easing further restrictions.\"\nA paper from the Department of Health shows that the R number in Northern Ireland is currently at between 0.9-1.10.\nThe minister said it showed the rate of infection was still decreasing, which meant the executive had been allowed to progress with making some changes to the lockdown regulations.\n\"One of the things we've always been aware of is keeping R below one... considering where we were back in mid-December, early January we are still moving in the right direction,\" he added.\n\"That comes about by the observance of restrictions and regulations but also by greater uptake of the vaccine as well and when we look to the hope that the vaccine brings that will allow us to come out of an incredibly dark time.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme told the Stormont Assembly more Pfizer doses would be used until extra AstraZeneca jabs arrive.\nShe said anyone expecting a second dose or who had already booked their first would have their appointments honoured.\nFirst jabs would continue in April, if at a slightly reduced rate, she added.\nOn Thursday, another Covid-19-related death and 169 new cases of the virus were recorded  in Northern Ireland.\nThere were no coronavirus-related deaths reported in the Irish Republic on Thursday.\nHowever, there were 582 confirmed new cases of the virus in the country.\nVaccine delivery issues could put the rollout plan back by four weeks in a \"worst-case scenario\", Ms Donnelly told Stormont's Health Committee, but the delay was more likely to be about two weeks.\n\"The mitigation measures that we put in place we hope will only delay us by two weeks, so it won't have a huge impact,\" she said.\nIt had been hoped vaccinations would be on offer to all people over the age of 40 when a mass vaccination centre at Belfast's SSE Arena opened on 29 March, but this would likely be delayed by two weeks, said Ms Donnelly.\n\"It will very much depend on the remaining deliveries that we get from AstraZeneca,\" she said.\n\"We have tried to find some mitigation through further use of the Pfizer vaccine. \nMs Donnelly said three of Northern Ireland's five health trusts would now rely mainly on Pfizer doses until more AstraZeneca supplies arrived.\nOn Wednesday, NHS England warned there could be a \"significant reduction\" in the number of doses available in April.\nEarlier, Health Minister Robin Swann said Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout was ahead of schedule and would be able to adapt.\nNews of the UK vaccine shortage was frustrating, if not surprising, said the chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee in Northern Ireland.\n\"The pace of vaccination has depended on the supply from the outset,\" tweeted Dr Alan Stout.\n\"We've done so well, so far, that the vast majority of those people who are at risk have now had their first dose,\" He told The Nolan Show.\n\"If it does mean that the consequences of delaying a first dose to someone we know who is at less risk, then that's going to have to be a decision that's made to protect those second doses.\"\nNorthern Ireland was still on course to meet its target of having most adults vaccinated by June or July, said Justice Minister Naomi Long.\nMeanwhile, more than 300 pharmacies have signed up to be part of the vaccination scheme.\nOfficial launch of the rollout will begin on 30 March, although some pharmacies may start before then.\n\"Their contribution to getting as many people vaccinated as possible will be invaluable,\" said Mr Swann.\nThe chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene, said. \"The accessibility and reach of the community pharmacy network, with pharmacists as skilled vaccinators, means they are well equipped to take part in the vaccine programme.\"\nMr Greene called their inclusion in the programme \"a fantastic and welcome step forward\" and said that this will not affect other pharmacy services.\nCommunity pharmacies were used to having to deal with supply issues, he said, adding that the anticipated drop in vaccine supply was unlikely to undermine Northern Ireland's programme."

      "tags": "Media,UK Royal Family,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex",
      "text": "A US private investigator has told BBC News he was paid by the Sun newspaper to obtain personal information about the Duchess of Sussex in the early days of her relationship with Prince Harry.\nBut Daniel Hanks says he unlawfully accessed detailed information including Meghan's social security number.\nThe Sun's publisher said it requested legitimate research and instructed Mr Hanks he must act lawfully.\nMeghan and Harry said it was a \"moment of reflection\" for the media industry.\nBBC News has seen the so-called \"comprehensive report on Meghan and her family\" which the investigator, also known as Danno Hanks, passed to the Sun. \nIt included her phone number, addresses and social security number as well as information on her family members. His report also included information on her ex-husband and a former boyfriend.\nIn the US, licensed private investigators are allowed full access to databases of personal information for some permitted reasons such as court reports. But accessing this additional level of detail for journalistic purposes is unlawful.\nMr Hanks said: \"Pretty much everything I found out they could find out themselves using legal means - with the exception of the social security numbers.\n\"When you have that information\u2026 it's the key to the kingdom.\"\nWhile there is no evidence it happened in this instance, social security numbers in particular could potentially be used to further other intrusive investigations.\nA spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex feel that today is an important moment of reflection for the media industry and society at large, as this investigative report shows that the predatory practices of days past are still ongoing, reaping irreversible damage for families and relationships.\n\"They are grateful to those working in media who stand for upholding the values of journalism, which are needed now more than ever before.\"\nThe duke and duchess have had a fraught relationship with the UK's tabloid press. During the couple's recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, they said this had created a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear\" and was largely to blame for them leaving the UK.\nPrince Harry is currently suing the publisher of the Sun, and the former publisher of the Daily Mirror, over allegations of phone hacking before 2011.\nSeveral stories appeared in the Sun, and other newspapers, at the beginning of the couple's relationship. They included an article claiming Prince Harry had \"bombarded\" his future wife with text messages and another detailing a weekend they spent together at Meghan's home in Toronto.\nDanno Hanks worked as a private investigator in the US for over 40 years gathering information on celebrities and high-profile people including Michael Jackson and Jeffrey Epstein.\nHe achieved some notoriety in the 1990s via appearances on daytime television and has been jailed four times, most recently in 2017 for extortion.\nMr Hanks said he had provided reports for most of the British tabloid newspapers. \nHe said the Sun wrote to him after the Leveson Inquiry into press standards and asked him to sign documents, seen by the BBC,  committing to act within the law and he repeated this assurance when he billed the Sun for his work. \nBut he claims no-one ever asked where he got his information. \"They didn't care. They just wanted the information,\" he said.\nMr Hanks came forward after being approached by Graham Johnson, a freelance journalist and editor of Byline Investigates, which publishes stories on the British media.\nMr Johnson, a former investigations editor at the Sunday Mirror, pleaded guilty to two counts of phone hacking in 2013.\nHis website has received money from prominent supporters of press reform, including actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, who were both victims of phone hacking, and his partner Emma Jones is on the board of Hacked Off, the press reform campaign group.\nMr Johnson, who paid Mr Hanks for access to his documents, said: \"This story definitely sticks out in the post-Leveson world because it has taken place five years after we thought these practices had stopped.\" \nMost victims of phone-hacking have settled their claims. Prince Harry hasn't. That's the vital context of this story.\nIn the course of nearly a year reporting on the complex, often fraught relationship between the monarchy and the media, it's become clear that he is, in an important sense, the last man standing among those victims. \nA News UK source told me that it was a \"huge priority\" and \"preoccupation\" for the company to repair relations with the royals after the severe damage done by the hacking revelations. \nBut the revelation that the Sun paid a private investigator to supply information on Meghan and her family, and that too in the period leading up to Prince Harry's bombshell public statement of 8 November 2016 in which he said a line had been crossed, will not improve relations. \nPrince Harry has been advised by many people both to make peace with Britain's tabloids, and to settle his claims against them. He hasn't. He may strike some journalists as an unlikely champion of press reform. But it is a role he seems keen on.\nMr Hanks, who has now retired, said watching Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah had also prompted him to speak out.\n\"I'm just doing it to clear my conscience,\" he said. \nAsked what he would say to Meghan and Harry directly, he said: \"I'm deeply sorry for what I did... and I'm available if your lawyers need to talk to me. I'm ready to give you what I know. Supply you with any information. I just wish this had never happened.\"\nIn a statement, News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun - said: \"In 2016, the Sun made a legitimate request of Mr Hanks to research contact details and addresses for Meghan Markle and possible relatives using legal databases which he had a license to use. He was paid $250.\n\"Mr Hanks was not tasked to do anything illegal or breach any privacy laws - indeed he was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully and he signed a legal undertaking that he would do so.\n\"The information he provided could not and did not raise any concerns that he had used illegal practices to obtain the information.  \n\"At no time did the Sun request the social security number of Meghan Markle, nor use the information he provided for any unlawful practice.\n\"The Sun abides by all laws and regulations and maintains strict protocols in relation to the obtaining of information from third parties. Strict compliance is in place to cover all our reporting.\""

      "text": "Covid-free sites must be developed to protect surgeries in the event of another coronavirus wave, a leading consultant has said.\nMark Taylor, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Northern Ireland, said lessons must be learned from the past year.\n\"The conditions that need surgery don't go away because of Covid,\" he said.\nHis warning comes as the BBC learned an estimated 1,600 cancer patients have been missed because of the pandemic.\nAccording to the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, a research body which helps inform decision-making, hundreds of people with serious cancers have yet to be diagnosed.\nThe figures include 200 bowel cancers, 200 lung cancers and 100 upper gastrointestinal cancers.\nThe Department of Health said every attempt had been made to protect the most urgent surgeries and to reschedule postponed operations as quickly as possible. \nThere were fewer cancellations during this latest surge than at the height of the first surge last March due to \"robust planning and prioritisation\" despite more service pressures, it added.\nAmong those patients adversely affected by the pandemic is Flo McClements.\nThe 72-year-old grandmother was diagnosed with an ovarian tumour last December. \nHer surgery was postponed for three weeks earlier this year and when it did happen, doctors found the cancer had spread.\nHer family have said they feel like \"collateral damage\" for the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas.\nDaughter-in-law Christine McClements told BBC News NI: \"It was awful. She is my mother-in-law and means everything to us. \n\"Cancer treatment is time critical.\"\nGregg McClements said the delay has been \"detrimental\" to his mother.\n\"The consultant had advised us we have gone from being able to cure my mum's cancer to now just being able to treat it and give her chemotherapy. Hopefully that might get it in remission, but there is no guarantee.\n\"So it is all devastating.\"\nAt his most recent appearance before a Stormont scrutiny committee, Health Minister Robin Swann said he wanted to see action to repair some of the damage Covid-19 had caused to the health service.\n\"I am keen that we scale up this high-priority surgery as quickly as possible,\" he told assembly members.\n\"This can be done by initially creating green pathways, as they have become known elsewhere.\n\"Eventually turning Belfast City Hospital into a green site which will serve the region.\"\nMark Regan, chief executive officer of the private Kingsbridge Hospital in Belfast, said the sector had provided an \"essential\" lifeline for the health service over the past year and maintaining that co-operation should be part of the solution.\nHe told BBC News NI that 1,754 surgeries had been performed on NHS patients and 13,267 CT, MRI and ultrasound scans carried out since the start of the pandemic.\n\"The outcome is ultimately that patients that may not have been able to be seen within the NHS are now being treated in each of the three independent hospitals,\" he said.\n\"Those are patients that are time dependent, red flag, cancers and things that could progress and could have a bigger impact if left.\"\nDeirdre Heenan, professor of social policy at Ulster University, said finding a way forward would ultimately depend on \"long-term strategic planning\".\n\"It's not good enough to say we don't have the resources. \n\"It's up to the Department of Health to make sure they have those resources; buy in those resources from the private sector if that's what is required. \n\"If we look at NHS England - they have set out a recovery plan with targets which talks about workforce planning; realises there will have to be specialists within the workforce and they have set out how they are going to do that. \n\"We should expect the same.\""

      "text": "NHS staff in Wales are not receiving the regular lateral flow tests they were promised, according to staff and the British Medical Association (BMA).\nThe Welsh health minister last year announced \"a programme of regular asymptomatic testing\" for NHS staff.\nSome doctors said they have not received any tests at all.\nThe Welsh government said more than 1.5 million lateral flow tests had been provided and Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would investigate.\nThe rapid tests can identify those who could be carrying coronavirus and may not be showing symptoms. \nThe BMA said NHS workers were concerned the tests, which take 20 to 30 minutes to show a result, had not been available to everyone and were easier to get hold of in some parts of Wales than others.\nDr Dai Samuel, a consultant and prominent BMA Cymru member, told Newyddion S4C he had been only been tested twice since the beginning of the pandemic.\nHe added there were large variations in receiving the tests across Wales.\nHe said: \"Testing is happening occasionally and at some locations. But on the whole, especially when speaking to those working on the front line, it is not happening every week.\n\"If you are symptomatic, you do get tested. But for those without symptoms, it is not happening regularly.\"\n\"I think [BMA Cymru] members are angry. We are more than willing to put ourselves at risk of contracting Covid. But we speak to those working in the film industry or in schools and they are getting lateral flow tests.\n\"But then, those working for health boards aren't always getting them. When I talk to friends, they are shocked to hear that.\"\nWhen questioned at the Welsh government's Covid press conference on Wednesday, Mr Gething said he was unaware there was an issue.\nHe said: \"They should be available. In the information I've had, they're going out regularly across the service.\n\"I'm concerned, which is why I'd like to get the detail to be able to give you an answer and resolve the issue.\n\"The whole point of providing these lateral flow tests is they are part of what we can do to give people to give people that extra reassurance, to give us an extra tool in our armoury to make sure we understand where coronavirus is and to help people protect themselves and the people around them.\"\nDr Samuel on behalf of BMA Cymru, \"It is concerning that the health minister doesn't seem to be aware what's happening at the coalface.\n\"Perhaps the government need to talk to health boards and understand why this testing isn't happening currently. If the government say they think it is happening, that isn't true.\"\nAt the health minister's request, Newyddion S4C supplied his office with further information so that he could offer a fuller response and address the issue.\nA spokesperson later issued a statement which said: \"We have supplied more than 1.5 million lateral flow tests to health boards and NHS trusts in Wales to support the delivery of asymptomatic workforce testing.\n\"We are also in the process of expanding the programme and providing supplies to primary care independent contractors and independent hospitals across Wales.\"  "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS has warned of a \"significant reduction in the weekly supply\" of Covid vaccines in England next month in a letter to local health organisations.\nThe letter says there has been a \"reduction in national inbound vaccines supply\" and asks organisations to \"ensure no further appointments are uploaded\" to booking systems in April.\nThe health secretary said it was a \"standard\" letter.\nThe BBC understands no-one who has booked a vaccine should lose a slot. \nAsked about it during a Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said the NHS regularly sent out \"technical letters\" that explained the \"ups and downs\" of supply.\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there would be fewer AstraZeneca vaccines than expected because of issues with the company's international supply. \nBBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood that the vaccine supply issue related to a consignment from a manufacturer in India, with half of the order delayed by four weeks.\nA spokesperson for the AstraZeneca said: \"Our UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule.\" \nWe were always warned supply was fragile - and these developments are a reminder of that.\nThe UK has its own plants that are supplying one to two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine each week. \nThere are also stocks coming from Pfizer's Belgium plant - these would be the ones that would be susceptible to any restrictions on exports the EU is threatening.\nThe Indian supplies were supposed to give the UK the \"bumper\" end to March, allowing the government to push ahead with vaccination of the under-50s within weeks.\nThis has now been put on hold, given significant numbers will need their second doses from the start of next month.\nThe government is still on track to hit its target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July. \nBy late Spring the first doses of Moderna - the third vaccine to have been approved in the UK - should start arriving.\nBut the delay to the second shipment from India means rollout is going to take a little longer than hoped at the start of this week.\nThe letter from the NHS in England says that \"over this next period it is vital\" that health organisations focus on vaccinating those in the priority groups one to nine, who are most vulnerable to coronavirus. \nIt advises vaccination services to work with local authorities, voluntary community and faith organisations \"to put in place reserve lists\" of people eligible for the vaccine - as well as targeting areas of lower uptake. \nThe NHS says vaccination centres and community pharmacy-led services should close unfilled bookings from the week commencing 29 March.\nEarlier, it was announced that almost half of British adults have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - more than 25 million people.\nAround 1.7 million people have also had a second dose.\nDuring Wednesday's briefing, Mr Hancock said the UK was \"ahead of schedule\" to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April.\nHe also reiterated a commitment to ensuring that all adults in the UK are offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\nSpeaking alongside the health secretary, Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said \"every day we vaccinate more people we are preventing more deaths\".\nAnd England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was \"no evidence\" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine causes an \"increased risk\" of blood clots.\nThe EU's medicines regulator has said it remains \"firmly convinced\" that the benefits of the  jab outweigh the risks, after several leading EU states paused their rollouts.\nProf Van-Tam added that all medicines have both side effects and benefits, and listed some of the rare side effects of paracetamol as examples, pointing out that most people had no issue with taking it.\nBBC politics correspondent Jonathan Blake said the hold-up would have an impact on the momentum of the vaccine rollout and possibly the government's targets.\nLabour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that people \"across the country\" would be \"anxious and worried\" about the news of delays.\n\"Matt Hancock must explain what the issue is with supply and what efforts are being made to resolve them,\" he added.\nOn Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that if Covid vaccine supplies in Europe do not improve, the EU \"will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate\".\nThe EU and the UK have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the export of the vaccines, exacerbated by post-Brexit disagreements.\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Hancock confirmed that shielding guidance in England would end on 31 March - meaning that more than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield.\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard. A further 5,758 people have tested positive."

      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon of breaking the ministerial code and misleading parliament. \nHe believes senior people around Scotland's first minister were part of a malicious attempt to have him removed from public life and ultimately jailed.\nMs Sturgeon has dismissed the claims and said he has no evidence. \nThe crisis could have significant implications for Scottish politics. \n\"He's trying to bring the house down.\" That was the conclusion of one of Ms Sturgeon's close allies shortly after it emerged Mr Salmond was publicly accusing her of misleading the Scottish Parliament and breaking the ministerial code.\nFor months, some around Scotland's first minister hoped Mr Salmond would hold back from directly criticising Ms Sturgeon in a way which could threaten her job. \nThey believed directly attacking Ms Sturgeon would alienate supporters of Scottish independence - something Mr Salmond would want to avoid. \nThat calculation changed with Mr Salmond's submission to an inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. \nThe picture above was taken days before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon were the dream team of the pro-indy movement.\nFor a decade, as leader and deputy leader, the pair had dominated nationalist politics.\nWhen Mr Salmond stood down, there was no question of who would take over: Ms Sturgeon was the natural successor.\nThat relationship collapsed completely as a result of sexual allegations later made against Mr Salmond.\nWhen the complaints emerged, Mr Salmond successfully took Ms Sturgeon's Scottish government to court over its process for investigating him. That process, it was found, was unlawful and \"tainted by apparent bias\".\nMr Salmond's victory cost the taxpayer at least \u00a3500,000.\nThe former first minister then stood trial accused of sexual assault - and was cleared of all charges. \nNow it is Ms Sturgeon and her government facing questions over the handling of complaints against Mr Salmond. \nThe former first minister of Scotland has made extraordinary allegations against the Scottish government and SNP - two institutions he used to lead. \nHe has claimed the process set up by the Scottish government, under which he was investigated, was unfair. \nMr Salmond alleges there was a malicious and concerted effort among a range of individuals to damage his reputation - and even to have him sent to jail. \nHe names people he believes helped to damage his reputation - including Ms Sturgeon's husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell and her Scottish government chief of staff, Liz Lloyd.\nAnd he has made serious allegations against the first minister too, arguing she has not told the truth about meetings with him, that she misled parliament and that she broke the code which governs the behaviour of ministers. \nA lot of the controversy surrounds what Ms Sturgeon knew and when - and accounts she gave publicly.\nMs Sturgeon originally said she first found out about a complaint against Mr Salmond, being investigated by her Scottish government, on 2 April 2018.\nThat meeting took place in her home and was not recorded. \nBut it has since been claimed Ms Sturgeon was told a few days earlier at the Scottish Parliament by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff.\nThat's raised questions over what Ms Sturgeon knew, why she met Mr Salmond privately and why it wasn't recorded as official government business. \nIt is not simply a question of a few days difference - it is a question of whether the second meeting should have been reported and treated as Scottish government businesses if Ms Sturgeon had indeed known what it was about in advance. \nMy colleague Phil Sim has written about the ins and outs of meetings here. \nMr Salmond has also made claims that Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code by not conceding earlier that the Scottish government's process for investigating him was flawed. \nHe alleges it was clear the Scottish government would lose a judicial review months before it was conceded it court - something which cost the taxpayer money. \nThere are two inquiries into the Scottish government's alleged mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond.\nOne is by James Hamilton, the first minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code, into whether she has breached it.\nThe second is a cross-party Holyrood inquiry into how her government handled complaints about Mr Salmond.\nThis has been beset by legal difficulties - with significant delays to Mr Salmond's evidence being published. After senior MSPs decided it should be made public, the Crown Office, Scotland's public prosecution service, raised concerns which led to further changes. \nMr Salmond has accused Ms Sturgeon of holding positions which are \"simply untrue\", \"manifestly untrue\" and \"untenable\".\n\"Parliament has been repeatedly misled,\" Mr Salmond contends.\nThere are many in the SNP - including a small but loyal group of elected politicians - who believe there was a conspiracy against him which could lead to several key officials in the Scottish government and SNP standing down.\nSome include Ms Sturgeon in that group.  \nMs Sturgeon says this is all nonsense and denies breaking the ministerial code.\nHer spokesman has accused Mr Salmond of trying to deflect from complaints made by women about his behaviour - and accused her former mentor of \"spinning false conspiracy theories\".\nMs Sturgeon said this week: \"He appears to be suggesting some kind of conspiracy or concerted campaign against him, without a shred of evidence.\n\"If he can't substantiate it, it's time for him to stop making these claims.\"\nNicola Sturgeon's political opponents have struggled to land any political blows in recent months.\nPolls suggest support for the SNP is as high as ever - and that backing for Scottish independence has been rising.\nAlthough there have been criticisms of the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, polling suggests Scots are happy Ms Sturgeon is making the decisions - and not Boris Johnson.\nTo many in Scottish politics, it appears the biggest threat to Ms Sturgeon's position now comes from her predecessor.\nMr Salmond's claims that his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 failed to tell the Scottish Parliament the truth - and that she broke the ministerial code - are serious.\nIn normal times such a breach of the code would lead to a resignation.\nThe code is clear: \"Ministers who knowingly mislead the parliament will be expected to offer their resignation.\"\nMs Sturgeon's political opponents have insisted that if she is found to have breached the code, she will have to stand down.\nPrivately, although they're confident it won't come to that, some around the first minister have admitted she would not be able to survive such a finding from her adviser on the code.\nMany senior figures in Scotland in the devolution era have resigned for less.\nThere is also nervousness in the SNP about the impact of these allegations hitting the headlines just weeks ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections. \nAlthough most would argue that the public just isn't paying attention, some acknowledge a number of party activists side with Mr Salmond - as do a section of SNP voters. \nIf the SNP are going to win a majority, they will need to mobilise their support ahead of 5 May. \nSome are worried this situation - combined with increasingly public splits on other issues - might turn some voters off, and lead to some activists staying at home.\nFor months, well connected opposition figures have talked about this inquiry being a moment of real danger for Ms Sturgeon's leadership. \nThey believe it raises questions about whether her government can be trusted. \nBut while many in Scottish politics discuss Ms Sturgeon's future - very few people are confidently predicting her demise.\nThe main reason is the pandemic. \nMs Sturgeon has high approval ratings for her response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nScots seem to approve of the way she is trying to deal with the health emergency - and some believe voters would forgive a breach of the rules in the midst of a crisis.\nIt's a view I've heard from Ms Sturgeon's critics as much as her allies; that these are not normal times and the normal rules of politics don't apply.\nMr Salmond's supporters are reluctant to speak on the record.\nI'm told that some elected parliamentarians are afraid of the backlash they would get if they did.\nBut one source said: \"I think in normal times she would be a goner. But I don't think she is a goner because people are rightly focused on the pandemic and her handling of the pandemic has been great.\"\nThe second is independence. \nMs Sturgeon has led the SNP and the independence movement to a point where successive polls have suggested support for leaving the UK is now a majority view. \nIf the SNP win big in May, they will use it to demand another referendum, which many think they could win.  \nThere have been criticisms from some in the SNP about a lack of strategy to force another referendum, but most accept the first minister is a key asset for the independence movement. Many think she is one of the main reasons for increasing support for leaving the UK. \nIf the SNP lost its leader that could have an impact on support for independence.\nWhile a number of names have been discussed, there is no certain successor - definitely not with the same UK and international profile.\nMr Salmond's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry will be a remarkable moment in the history of the SNP; the leader who took the party to the brink of independence accusing the leader who could deliver it of misleading parliament.\nEven if Ms Sturgeon survives, Mr Salmond's allies believe others may be \"toast\"; including senior civil servants and advisers.\nBut senior allies of Ms Sturgeon still appear confident she will lead them into the next Scottish election and beyond.\nOne concluded: \"Is she going to get through this? Yes she is.\""

      "text": "Since she was a child, Faith has suffered from intrusive thoughts. \nThe 17-year-old from Wrexham, who was the Wales winner of the BBC Young Reporter competition, was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) after many years of symptoms.\nSince her diagnosis, Faith has become a young ambassador for the charity OCD-UK.\nHere she shares her experiences of OCD and highlights what help is available to help others with the condition. \nMy name is Faith and I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. \nOCD affects about 750,000 people in the UK alone. Thoughts and images are involuntary. It's a way anxious brains try and overcompensate to make sure you don't have accidents.\nI had undiagnosed OCD for about five years at least. I didn't know what it was so I didn't know how to cope with it properly. I assumed it was some sort of depression or anxiety disorder, I had no idea it was OCD.\nMost people think of the stereotypical \"oh, I like things nice and tidy\" and I had that perception too, but that's not all OCD is.\nI thought trying to fight my thoughts would make them go away, but it didn't. Whatever points you try and make, OCD comes up with a completely absurd answer for everything.\nI would describe myself as having \"pure O\".  It's not a medical term, it's definitely more colloquial.\nBut it basically refers to people with OCD whose compulsions are mainly mental and that's me. Intrusive thoughts have many different themes and they're different for everyone. Everyone gets intrusive thoughts whether they have OCD or not. But while everyone gets them, people with OCD react very differently because of our brain chemistry.\nI'd develop this dependency on other people to fight my anxiety for me, which isn't a long-term coping mechanism, sadly.\nThe saddest thing is that everyone with OCD just wants to be happy and this is why we perform the compulsions even though we know they're irrational -  they're a safety blanket. But they make everything a million times worse. They feed the cycle of compulsions feeding the obsessions and it's very time-consuming and painful.\nThe danger with mental compulsions is that they are completely invisible to most people and they don't know that they're a symptom of OCD.\nAs they're so shameful, people don't talk about them and it goes undiagnosed in a lot of cases. \nOCD is a mental illness so you can't just take medication and it goes away, but you can effectively recover from it to a point where it doesn't affect your life anymore.\nThis is achieved through medication, exposure, response prevention and cognitive behaviour therapy, a mix of any of those can really help improve your quality of life.\nAs an OCD-UK young ambassador, we have a group chat and we talk to each other every day. We know how each other is getting on and know how to help each other.\nWe don't give in to our compulsions, we work together. It's an amazing little community that I'm very proud to be part of."

      "text": "The French capital is set to go into a month-long Covid lockdown as the country fears a third wave.\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France will be placed under the measures from midnight on Friday.\nThese measures will not be as strict as the previous lockdown, Prime Minister Jean Castex said, with people allowed to exercise outdoors. \nFrance has recorded more than 35,000 new infections within the past 24 hours.\nMr Castex said a \"third wave\" of infections in the country was looking increasingly likely.\nThe situation in Paris is particularly worrying with 1,200 people in intensive care there, more than at the peak of the second wave in November, Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said.  \nUnder the new measures, non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but schools will remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a \"particular sanitary protocol\". \nGovernment spokesman Gabriel Attal stressed there would be differences with the two earlier lockdowns and said further details would be given of which business could stay open or would have to shut.\nPeople will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home and are not allowed to travel to other parts of the country unless they have a valid reason. Those in the affected areas will have to fill out a form to explain why they have left their homes. \nThere is a weary resignation about Paris, as people prepare for another four weeks of tedium. Yes, we know this third lockdown won't be quite as bad as the second - which was itself a lighter version of the first. But still.\nAnother month of bits of paper for the police; another month of having to justify a trip to the supermarket; another month without meaningful social contact. It's enough to drive you to distraction.\nExcept it hasn't. In general, most Parisians simply knuckle under. Those who can are leaving by train or car, but because schools are staying open, most families will stick it out in the city.\nEveryone's made the calculation. The long Easter weekend in two weeks is a bust. But the Paris school holidays start on 17 April - exactly when the lockdown is supposed to end.\nThat's the light that will keep people going. Spring break.   \nAs well as the greater Paris region, the northern Hauts-de-France, Seine-Maritime and Eure areas will go under lockdown as well as the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera.\nFrance's nationwide curfew will remain in place. However, it will begin an hour later at 19:00 (18:00 GMT), taking into account the longer hours of daylight. \nFears of a third wave come as the French government faces criticism for its slow vaccine rollout. \nFrom Friday, France will resume vaccinating using the AstraZeneca jab following the EMA's announcement that it was fit for use. Mr Castex said he would be getting the vaccine straight away to prove that it was OK.\nFrance had suspended the jab after a number of people in Europe reported blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered. \nA survey conducted just as the suspension was announced found that only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,India,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "India has missed the target of giving its entire adult population of 940 million two vaccinations by the end of 2021. \nThe target was first announced by Prakash Javadekar in May, who was a minister in the federal government at the time.\n\"Vaccination in India will be completed by December 2021,\" he said.\nAs of 30 December, 64% of India's adult population was fully vaccinated and around 90% had received the first dose. \nExperts said achieving full vaccination coverage would take a long time. \nDr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist, says the target set by the government was \"unrealistic\" because achieving 100% vaccine coverage at any given point would not be possible.\n\"There would always be some people who are unwilling to get vaccinated for various reasons,\" he said.\nWeekly vaccinations have slowed since the first week of December, according to India's vaccine dashboard - CoWin.\nSince mid-October, more second doses have been given than first doses.\nThe daily vaccination numbers have been fluctuating with the highest number achieved on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on 17 September. \nOver 20 million jabs were administered on that day, but the country has not been able to achieve the same number since. \nThe monthly average for September was around 8.1 million doses a day, but fell to 5.4 million in October and was 5.7 million in November. \nSome experts say that if the September momentum had been kept up, India could have been closer to the target, but that demand would eventually have fallen.\nThe vaccination drive, which started in January, faced challenges such as supply constraints due to raw materials shortages, logistical issues and vaccine hesitancy.\nBy the second half of the year, the supply constraints had been addressed.\nThe challenge is now demand rather than the supply. \"The vaccination drive has slowed down now because people are hesitant to take the vaccine,\" says Dr Lahariya.\nOn 3 November, the government launched a programme to conduct at-home inoculations. \nA month after the programme was announced, first dose coverage had only increased by 6% and second dose coverage by 12%. \nMr Modi has now asked states to ramp up vaccinations in districts with low uptake amid fears about the spread of the more transmissible Omicron variant.\nOver the past few months, the 100% target has not been mentioned in any of the press conferences by the health ministry. \nWe asked the ministry about missing the target, but did not hear back.\nIndia is currently administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, and the Russian vaccine, Sputnik. \nIndia's largest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India (SII), was manufacturing 250 million doses of Covishield a month before the company announced production cuts in December due to a lack of orders.\nIt now produces between 125 and 150 million doses a month.\nBharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, makes 50 to 60 million doses a month.\nIndia's health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, recently said in parliament that states had a stock of 170 million vaccines as of 20 December. \nHe added that vaccine manufacturing capacity would rise from the current 310 million doses a month to 450 million doses a month in the next two months. \nThis may include vaccines from other manufacturers. The junior minister of health, Dr Bharati Pawar, said: \"Both companies [Bharat Biotech and SII] have achieved 90% of their production capacity.\" \nThe government has announced jabs for children aged 15 to 18 years and a booster programme for health workers and those above 60 years with other health conditions starting this month.\nSII chief, Adar Poonawalla, said earlier this month that the company has 500 million vaccines in stock in case the government announces a booster programme. \nThe health ministry has said that around 6.2 million doses have been wasted since the start of the vaccine programme, which is considerably below the number that the World Health Organisation (WHO) would expect to be wasted.\nThere are other Indian-made vaccines expected to be used against Covid.\nNovavax, developed in the US and named Covavax in India, is being manufactured by SII - and has been granted emergency use listing by the WHO. It has also been granted approval by India. \nSII has told the BBC that it is currently stockpiling these vaccine doses, and the capacities to manufacture this vaccine would be separate from Covishield.\nBharat Biotech has sought approval for trials of its intranasal vaccine as a booster shot. \nCorbevax, manufactured by Biological-E, has also been granted approval in India.\nIndia did give emergency use approval to the US-made Moderna vaccine in June, but so far no doses have been sent to India.\nJohnson & Johnson's single dose vaccine was granted approval in August, but so far it hasn't been administered.\nSupplies of foreign-made vaccines are facing legal hurdles over the manufacturers' desire for protection against potential claims arising out of using the vaccines - something no vaccine maker in India has at the moment.\nWhat about vaccine exports?\nWith vaccine demand in India slowing and daily cases falling, SII resumed exporting vaccines in November to Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme.\nBefore exports were halted by India in April, Covax was reliant on supplies from SII to support the vaccine programmes in low and middle-income countries.\nBut exports have been slow and Covax has since relied on other vaccines. \nOf the 700 million vaccines that have been delivered to 144 countries by Covax as of 14 December, around 40 million doses were provided by SII. \nAround 28 million of those doses were supplied between January and April 2021, according to Covax. \nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions"

      "text": "Several European countries are experiencing a new surge in coronavirus infections, while a number have also suspended use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine over safety concerns. \nThe European Medicines Agency is standing by its decision to approve the vaccine and has reiterated there is \"no indication\" the jab causes blood clots. It is investigating further and its results are due to be released on Thursday. \nCorrespondents in six cities explain how Europeans are reacting to the new wave of infections and the stuttering rollout.\nVaccinations 857,792 |14.81 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared with last week +2,484\nDenmark was the first country in Europe to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution, followed by Norway and Iceland. It is yet another blow to its vaccine plans, writes Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen.\nAbout 1 in 10 people here have now received at least one vaccine dose, a quarter of which were supplied by AstraZeneca.\nAll adults were expected to be vaccinated by the end of June, but delivery delays have seen that target pushed back a number of times. Health authorities on Wednesday suggested the end of July.\nDanes have expressed disappointment about the rollout on Twitter. \"It's simply going too slow,\" writes Lone Juul Lang. But most have supported the government's handling of coronavirus and a survey in January revealed that almost nine out of 10 Danes want to be vaccinated.\nSince the new year, infections have fallen sharply and Denmark is slowly emerging from a second lockdown. But signs of fatigue are beginning to show. Anti-lockdown protests have recently been held in some Danish cities and there's political pressure to do more.\nHowever, concerns about new variants of coronavirus, have made the government hesitant to open up faster.\nVaccinations 7,552,120 | 11.19 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared with last week +25,912\nAfter an unpromising start, the AstraZeneca jab has come to hold a key place in France's inoculation programme, but a new poll on public confidence is not reassuring, writes Hugh Schofield in Paris.\nIt's the worst anniversary that Emmanuel Macron can have imagined, says Nicolas Beytout, editor of France's L'Opinion newspaper.\nExactly a year ago the president announced the first lockdown and said France was \"at war\" with the virus. But now his strategy has been knocked dangerously off course by the suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIn recent weeks the AstraZeneca jab has overtaken Pfizer/BioNTech in the number of doses delivered.  \nBut if people turn away from AstraZeneca, waiting for new vaccines like Johnson and Johnson, then Mr Macron's calculations go awry. The sweet moment when immunity starts biting is postponed, leading to lockdowns and public anger. \nAccording to an Elabe survey conducted just as the suspension was announced, only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca. For Pfizer/BioNTech, the figure is 52%.\nVaccinations 9,853,966 | 11.76 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +23,889\nCoronavirus infections are spreading fast again in Germany and there's already growing dissatisfaction over a slow vaccine rollout, writes Jenny Hill in Berlin.\n\"We wonder now when we will ever be vaccinated?\" says kindergarten worker Tanya. \nJust 8% of the German population has received a first jab in a country which, most experts agree, is firmly in the grip of a third wave. \nGermany has relied largely on Pfizer/BioNTech, but ministers need AstraZeneca if they're to keep their promises and speed things up.\nSo the decision to suspend the jab has caused dismay, anger and concern.\nNot least because, even in a country that is broadly open to vaccination, AstraZeneca has a bit of an image problem; in part, because the government initially blocked its use in older age groups.\nMinisters argue now, as then, that they're acting to create public trust. Many here would say they've had the opposite effect - undermining faith not just in the vaccine but, in an election year, the government itself.\nVaccinations 4,557,060 | 12.04 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +29,557\nIn Poland, new infections are rising at an alarming rate as the country's third wave continues to gather momentum, writes Adam Easton in Warsaw.\nIn response to the health ministry's latest tweet about the number of new cases, which rose by 45% compared with a week earlier, some wanted tougher restrictions.\n\"In Germany, a hard lockdown, in Poland indignation that you can't go to the pub in the evening,\" writes @JMojzych, adding that there is a higher rate of infection here than in Germany.\nIn terms of the vaccination rollout, Poland has just fallen out of the top 10 EU countries with the highest rate of administering jabs. A recent opinion poll found that 53.1% of respondents agreed the EU had failed to provide sufficient vaccines to member states.\nUnlike many EU countries, Poland is continuing to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nBut people questioning, or deferring their AstraZeneca jab has become \"a noticeable phenomenon\", Prof Agniezka Mastalerz-Migas, from Wroclaw Medical University, told broadcaster TVN24 . \nVaccinations 7,039,518 | 11.64 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +12,018\nThe timing could hardly have been worse for Italy, writes Mark Lowen in Milan.\nOn the day that most of Italy entered another lockdown and new vaccine sites opened to ramp up rollout, they were abruptly shut again with the AstraZeneca suspension - and those waiting for their longed-for panacea were turned away. \nIt's fodder for Italy's Eurosceptics.\n\"Another failure by Europe,\" cried Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League. He adds that he hoped the Sputnik V vaccine would arrive soon - a comment not lost on those noting Mr Salvini's pro-Russia sympathies.\nAt a Pfizer vaccination centre in Milan, most seem unfazed.\n\"If my mother had got AstraZeneca today, not Pfizer, it would be the same,\" says Elena Grazena. \"I trust the science.\" \nMaria Polizzi tells me she is a little worried by the suspension. \"Luckily AstraZeneca wasn't the vaccine I got,\" she says. \"It's right they're suspending until they investigate.\"\nAmid a third wave and frustration at a slow vaccine rollout, it's as though this exhausted country has been kicked while it's down.\nVaccinations 1,079,144 | 11.98 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +1,876\nIn Austria, there are mixed feelings about AstraZeneca, writes Bethany Bell in Vienna.\nOn one of Vienna's main shopping streets, I meet Angelika, who tells me she is relieved to have had her first jab of AstraZeneca last week.\n\"I'm really happy and glad to have it because I'm a teacher,\" she tells me. \"I feel great. It was fine.\" She says it is much better to be inoculated than to get a bad case of Covid-19.\nAustria halted one batch of the vaccine last week, while they investigate the death of a nurse who died several days after being inoculated.\nBut vaccinations with AstraZeneca continue.\nAustria's health minister Rudolf Anschober has called for a swift European solution, instead of individual national decisions.\nEveryone will have to make up their own minds, says Angelika. \"I think we take a lot of other medicines where we don't know what's inside.\"\nAnother shopper, Manfred is more suspicious.\n\"In general, I am pro-vaccination,\" he tells me. But he says he won't take AstraZeneca at the moment, \"because of the serious adverse events. I'm a bit scared to get ill from the vaccine\".\nHe says he might change his mind if the studies are okay. "

      "title": "Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A number of countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution following reports that some people have suffered blood clots after being given the jab.\nBut is it a case of being too cautious? Are these nations missing the bigger picture?\nThe decision has been made on the basis of the precautionary principle - a well-established approach in science and medicine that stresses the need to pause and review when evidence is uncertain.\nBut in a fast-moving pandemic, when each decision can have major consequences, it is an approach which can sometimes do more harm than good.\nThe data supplied by AstraZeneca shows there have been 37 reports of blood clots among the 17m people across Europe who have been given the vaccine. \nBut the key question that has to be asked is whether this is cause or coincidence? Would these clots have happened anyway? \nAdverse events like this are monitored carefully, so regulators can assess if they are happening more than they should.\nThe 37 reports of clots are below the level you would expect. What is more, there is no strong biological explanation why the vaccine would cause a blood clot. \nIt is why the World Health Organization and UK drugs regulators have all said there is no evidence of a link.\nEven the European Medicines Agency, which is looking into the reports, has suggested the vaccine should continue to be used in the meantime given the risk Covid presents to health.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the decisions by individual nations to pause their rollouts have baffled experts.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the WHO's working group on Covid vaccines, says stopping rollout in this way is \"highly undesirable\" and could undermine confidence in the vaccine, costing lives in the long-term.\n\"Making the right call in situations like this is not easy, but having a steady hand on the tiller is probably what is needed most.\"\nThis is not the first time countries in Europe have exercised caution about the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe precautionary principle was adopted by Germany, France and others when they did not initially recommend use of the vaccine for the over-65s. French President Emmanuel Macron even called it \"quasi-ineffective\".\nThe over 65s decision has now been reversed, but the impact is still being felt it seems.\nGermany and France have supplies of the vaccine going to waste, with both countries having used fewer than half their supplies of the AstraZeneca jab so far. It has left them far more reliant on the Pfizer vaccine than the UK is.\nAnd this is threatening to have deadly consequences. France, Germany and the other major European nations all have higher rates of infection than the UK, and face the prospect of things getting worse before they get better.\nIf you look back at the decision on the over-65s, you can see how it was made. The way the trials had been organised meant there was limited evidence on its use in older age groups.\nThe organisers had wanted to recruit younger adults in the initial stages for safety reasons, so when it came to regulators assessing infection rates the data was not yet ready for older people.\nBut there was evidence from blood samples that the vaccine had prompted a strong immune response in the older age groups. So there was no reason why the vaccine would not work in older age groups - it was just that insufficient time had passed to gather the evidence in the real world.\nThere was also a problem interpreting results because of the way the trial was run. There was a lack of consistency across the different sites used. \nProtocols and practices followed varied across each, including the use of a half-dose in one.\nSome have described it as four trials within a trial. It created a somewhat messy set of data to interpret.\nThe UK looked past this and took the leap though - and within months was reporting \"spectacular\" results in reduced levels of serious illness in the over-80s.\nIt was this pragmatic approach to decision-making that also led the UK to recommend up to a three-month gap between doses.\nThis caused much controversy when it was announced at the end of December.\nThe Pfizer vaccine was not tested like this in trials - the interval was three weeks.\nBut again, the absence of evidence did not mean the move would not work or was not based on logic. \nThe AstraZeneca trials did have longer intervals for some participants, which seemed to make it more effective, while evidence on the Moderna vaccine, which is a similar type of jab to Pfizer, also suggested it could work.\nIt is also well-established that with two-dose vaccines, most of the protection is provided by the first dose, while the second boosts that and provides more long-lasting protection. \nWith cases rising rapidly at the time, the UK was clear the benefit of maximising available vaccine supplies to provide some protection to more people was the right step even if the trial evidence did not directly support it.\nProf Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in understanding risk at Cambridge University, says it shows that sometimes you have to look beyond the precautionary principle and be bold in your decision-making.\n\"The precautionary principle favours inaction as a way of reducing risk. But the problem is that these are not normal times and inaction can be more risky than action.\"\nWhat is needed in circumstances like these, according to Sir David, is to work out what is most likely on the balance of probability. That requires looking at both the direct and indirect evidence and the context those decisions are being made in.\n\"Sometimes it can be harmful to wait for certainty. Not vaccinating people will costs lives.\" "

      "text": "Support in schools needs to be targeted to avoid trying to get children to \"catch up on everything\" when classes resume, according to researchers.\nSchools are yet to know the impact of months away from face-to-face teaching.\nCardiff University researcher Catherine Foster said children from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to have fallen behind while learning from home.\nThe Welsh government said the equivalent of about 2,000 extra full-time teaching staff had been hired.\nBut opposition parties have said classroom return plans lack detail.\nPrimary school children and some secondary pupils have returned to school after learning from home since before Christmas, but pupils will not all be back in class full time until 12 April. \nOn top of the face-to-face teaching missed this term, pupils also had to learn at home from March to July last year and many spent periods having to isolate, even when they were allowed back in class.\nDr Foster is part of a team at the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research and Data which has surveyed young people in years 7 to 12 about their home learning experiences.\nShe said international research suggested children had fallen behind in terms of educational attainment and \"the progress lost is even worse for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds\".\nResearch suggested many children would not have engaged with their school work and motivation could be a problem when they are back in class, but experiences would differ, she added.\n\"Everyone has lost something - it varies a lot. But if there's a focus on catching up and trying to say 'well you've got to catch-up on everything you've missed, plus the work you've got to do this year', it's not going to help\", she said\n\"There's a lot of logic in saying that maybe we should just be identifying what young people need to progress and focusing on filling in those particular gaps, rather than trying to chuck everything at them and expecting them to do two years in one.\"\nAt Ysgol y Ddraig in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, the school believes that working towards the core aims of Wales' new curriculum will help with addressing the effects of the pandemic on children.\nBut executive head teacher Ty Golding thinks talk of \"catching-up\" is not helpful.\nHe said: \"I think we're trying to avoid the term catch-up if I'm honest, because it does suggest that learning is a linear process by which if children miss a chunk of work they'll never be able to engage in that level of learning.\n\"Really for us at the moment it's about the social reconnection, it's about getting the children back into routines\".\nAt Ysgol Glan Morfa in Cardiff, Gethin Bickerton has been employed as a teaching assistant since autumn 2020, one of hundreds of extra staff employed through the Welsh government's Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards programme.\nBefore the pandemic, he was an actor travelling around schools helping children learn about figures from Welsh history.\nNow he uses those skills to do role play with children to improve communication and help small groups with their reading.\n\"We have a mixture of pupils here. We have some who have engaged really well with online learning and those who can really engage with the work, but then we have the polar opposite,\" he said.\nMr Bickerton works with young children in the foundation phase where improving literacy is a key priority.\n\"The main focus at the moment is getting them back into some sort of routine and getting them back socialising with other people through the medium of Welsh - that's our main aim.\n\"But also going back to basics with some individuals as well, learning letters, words and forming sentences.\"\nLast summer, the Welsh government announced \u00a329m to fund 900 extra teaching staff, followed by a further \u00a372m investment announced earlier this month.\nIt said it had outstripped the recruitment target and so far the equivalent of around 2,000 extra full time staff had been employed.\nNew figures from the government showed that included 472 new full time teaching assistants and 248 new full time teachers, as well as hundreds of part time appointments and existing staff taking on extra hours.\nA spokesman said an evaluation of recruitment through Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards would be commissioned this year.  \nHe added: \"Initial data suggests the funding has supported the recruitment of mostly new, rather than existing, staff.\n\"1,508 new full-time equivalent posts have been recruited to, compared to 487 (FTE) posts created from increased hours for existing staff.\"\nBut opposition parties have said the plans failed to provide a longer-term vision.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said without a detailed roadmap for education recovery \"nobody's sure of how it will be spent and whether it will be spent effectively\".\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said a recovery plan needed to be part of \"an ambitious plan to invest in teaching\" in the long term.\n\"What we're hearing from the government is yet more announcements about funding but no plan about how that funding is going to be used.\""

      "text": "As I write, nine members of the Scottish Parliament are still in a virtual meeting, discussing, voting, likely indeed arguing, over their conclusions on the future of the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\nTheir inquiry is part of the machinations of a long running dispute between one of the most successful political duos this country has seen for decades, as the first minister and her predecessor, and very much former friend, have come to blows. Remind yourself what the very sorry saga is all about here.\nWhat we know from inside that committee room is that the MSPs have voted by a margin of one vote, 5-4, that Nicola Sturgeon misled them. \nBefore we see the final report, which may not come for a while, it's hard to know what caveats they have applied, precisely what the circumstances are that they describe. The details will matter. \nMs Sturgeon's team is already trying to dismiss the findings as a partisan attack, a predictable political play from a committee of MSPs, designed to damage the first minister, whose popularity they envy, who has been almost untouchable for so long. \nThe findings they really fear are from the separate Hamilton Inquiry, being carried out by an independent lawyer in to whether she broke the rules that govern ministers' behaviour. \nIf she's found to have done that, convention suggests she would have to resign. \nIt is clear that Nicola Sturgeon has no intention of giving into opposition demands out there to get her to quit on the basis of the MSPs' conclusions.  \nOf course this is intensely political, it's not just about who said what, when and where. \nBut a public finding from a parliamentary committee that she misled them can't just be brushed away. \nIt's a serious accusation from a group of senior politicians after an investigation that looked at thousands of pages of evidence. \nIt's a huge distraction just before the official start of vital Scottish elections. It underlines the bitter lines drawn inside the SNP during this saga. \nAnd it's damaging to the reputation of one of the country's most important politicians, whose personal standing is key not just to what happens in Scotland, but what happens to the whole of the UK. \nThe SNP has been all powerful under Ms Sturgeon's leadership. And her personal profile has been a vital part of creating a powerful political sense, although importantly never a certainty, that another referendum on Scottish independence was somehow inevitable. \nIf the SNP clinches a majority in May, it's her intention to use that to claim a mandate for another ballot. (Remember, it is also the UK government's firm intention to say no, which is, as things stand, its legal right.) \nBut in turn, anything that tarnishes her, could damage the SNP's standing in those May elections. \nAnd anything that harms her credibility, chips away at the sometimes lazy political sentiment, that the events of the last few years have set Scotland firmly on a path out of the UK. \nThe arguments of a group of politicians won't settle all of this. \nBut what they decide is one part of the overall wrangle over the future of the union itself.

He left the ITV programme later that day.\nThe total of 57,121 complaints is 12,600 more than those made over a race row on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007.\nThe duchess herself is among those who have complained to the watchdog.\nMorgan responded on Twitter: \"Only 57,000? I've had more people than that come up & congratulate me in the street for what I said. The vast majority of Britons are right behind me.\"\nOfcom, which has regulated British TV since 2003, has already launched an investigation into Good Morning Britain. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman said the investigation was ongoing.\nA further 4,398 complaints have been made about the Oprah interview itself, which was broadcast on ITV on 8 March. Some objected to the duke and duchess' claims about the Royal Family, some about the timing given the Duke of Edinburgh's ill health, and some about the use of allegedly misleading press headlines in the programme.\nOfcom said: \"We're assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate.\" The regulator did not say which aspect of the interview had attracted the complaints.\nIn the in-depth interview, Meghan told Oprah her mental health became so bad she \"didn't want to be alive any more\", that she did not receive the help she asked for from Buckingham Palace, and that an unnamed member of the Royal Family had queried \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\nThe day after its UK broadcast, Morgan said he did not believe her, adding that \"the fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible\". \nHe briefly walked off the programme after clashing with weather presenter Alex Beresford, and he was criticised by mental health charity Mind.\nMorgan later conceded that it was \"not for me to question if she felt suicidal\", but has defended his \"right to be allowed to have an opinion\"."

      "text": "The prime minister's former aide, Dominic Cummings, has criticised the Department of Health as \"a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE\" at the start of the pandemic.\nHe said that was why Boris Johnson had taken direct control of the vaccine programme.\nHe also told MPs Mr Johnson approached him about working in Downing Street the week before he took office. \nHe said he asked him to \"help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare\".\nMr Cummings said he agreed but one of his preconditions was that science funding should be doubled. \nHe was giving evidence to MPs on the Science and Technology Committee about the creation of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency know as Aria. \nBut in his first public appearance since leaving office, he also criticised the health department's response to the pandemic. \nHe said: \"In spring 2020 you had a situation where the Department for Health was just a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE and all of that, you had serious problems with the funding bureaucracy for therapeutics on Covid.\"\nHe said the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had advised Number 10 that the vaccine rollout should not be run out of the Department for Health and that a separate task force should be created.\n\"It's not coincidental that the vaccine programme worked the way it did. It's not coincidental that to do that we had to take it out of the Department of Health,\" he added.\n\"We had to have it authorised very directly by the prime minister and say strip away all the normal nonsense that we can see is holding back funding.\"\nBut a source at the health department told the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming that getting the vaccine programme established was a \"massive team effort\". \nThey added: \"Everyone in DHSC was and is spending their time focused on saving lives, expanding the world leading vaccine rollout and getting through this pandemic.\"\nThe Vaccine Taskforce is a team of almost 200 people at the Department for Business that was established to make sure the UK got promising vaccines.\nMr Cummings said as the country emerges from lockdown there needs to be an \"urgent very, very hard look\" by Parliament at \"what went wrong and why\" during the pandemic.\n\"One of the most obvious lessons is the incredible value potentially of getting science and technology stuff right, the disaster that can come if you don't get it right.\"\nIt was this \"horrific Whitehall bureaucracy\" he wanted to strip away when he championed the new \"high risk\" Aria scientific research agency, he told MPs.\nHe said: \"The prime minister came to speak to me the Sunday before he became prime minister and said: 'Would I come in to Downing Street to try and help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare?'.\n\"I said, yes, if first of all you are deadly serious about actually getting Brexit done and avoiding a second referendum; secondly, double the science budget; third, create some Aria like entity, and fourth  support me in trying to change how Whitehall works and the Cabinet Office works because it is a disaster zone. And he said 'deal'.\"\nAnswering MPs' questions about science funding, Mr Cummings said scientists had been lobbying for the creation of a body such as Aria that would have \"extreme freedom\" but he said he was aware that this was \"completely hostile to normal bureaucracy\". \nThe government says Aria will fund \"high-risk, high-reward\" scientific research and \"help to cement the UK's position as a global science superpower\".\nIt will be run along the lines of US equivalents that were instrumental in the creation of the internet and GPS.\nAria, which has \u00a3800m funding over four years, will have a \"higher tolerance for failure than is normal\", ministers say.\nBut the amount of funding it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).\nFor 2020-21, the government has allocated \u00a310.36bn for its research programmes and bodies.\nLabour said there needed to be greater transparency around how the agency would operate.\nLabour MP Dawn Butler, who sits on the science committee, said because Aria was exempt from freedom of information requests this would undoubtedly \"raise alarm bells\" about how taxpayers' money would be spent given \"the recent PPE scandals\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the \"corporate governance arrangements are very robust\". \nHe added he would be responsible for reporting to Parliament on Aria and that the agency would have to submit accounts that would be scrutinised by MPs. \n\"I think there will be a great deal of transparency and oversight,\" he added. \nAt the start of the hearing, chair Greg Clark said Mr Cummings had agreed to give evidence on the Covid pandemic to a joint inquiry by the science and health committees."

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

But in order to help ensure that you and your family members stay safe with Peloton products in your home, we need your help,\" he wrote in the letter to customers.\n\"Keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times.

      "text": "The EU's leading states are to restart their roll-out of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after Europe's medicines regulator concluded it was \"safe and effective\".\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed the jab after 13 European countries suspended use of the vaccine over fears of a link to blood clots.\nIt found the jab was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of clots.\nGermany, France, Italy and Spain said they would resume using the jab.\nIt is up to individual EU states to decide whether and when to re-start vaccinations using the AstraZeneca vaccine. Sweden said it needed a \"few days\" to decide.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday called on countries to continue using the vaccine, and is due to release the results of its own review into the vaccine's safety on Friday. \nThe agency's investigation focused on a small number of cases of unusual blood disorders. In particular, it was looking at cases of cerebral venous thrombosis - blood clots in the head. \nDecisions to suspend use of the vaccine sparked concerns over the pace of the region's vaccination drive, which had already been affected by supply shortages.\nFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex announced new measures for his country on Thursday, saying the pandemic was clearly accelerating and a \"third wave\" of infections looked increasingly likely.\nMr Castex, 55, said he would receive the jab himself on Friday afternoon.\nEmer Cooke, the agency's executive director, told a news conference: \"This is a safe and effective vaccine.\"\n\"Its benefits in protecting people from Covid-19 with the associated risks of death and hospitalisation outweigh the possible risks.\" \nThe EMA's expert committee on medicine safety, Mrs Cooke said, had found that \"the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of... blood clots\".   \nBut the EMA, she added, could not rule out definitively a link between the vaccine and a \"small number of cases of rare and unusual but very serious clotting disorders\".\nTherefore the committee has, she said, recommended raising awareness of these possible risks, making sure they are included in the product information. Additional investigations are being launched, Mrs Cooke added. \n\"If it was me, I would be vaccinated tomorrow,\" Mrs Cooke added. \"But I would want to know that if anything happened to me after vaccination what I should do about it and that's what we're saying today.\"\nWelcoming the review's endorsement of the vaccine as safe and effective, German Health Minister Jens Spahn added, \"Doctors should be informed about the risk of venous thrombosis in women under 55 years of age, so that they in turn can inform patients.\"\nThirteen European countries suspended use of the vaccine, after reports of a small number of cases of blood clots among vaccine recipients in the region.\nLeading EU states said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\"There were a few very unusual and troubling cases which justify this pause and the analysis,\" French immunologist Alain Fischer, who heads a government advisory board, told France Inter radio. \"It's not lost time.\"\nIn Germany, the health ministry also pointed to a small number of rare blood clots in vaccinated people when justifying its decision. It postponed a summit on extending the vaccine rollout ahead of the EMA's announcement. \nOther countries, such as Austria, halted the use of certain batches of the drug, while Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic were among those to say they would continue to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nDecisions to halt rollouts of the AstraZeneca vaccine were criticised by some politicians and scientists.\nA spokeswoman for Germany's opposition Free Democrats said the decision had set back the country's entire vaccination rollout. German Greens health expert Janosch Dahmen, meanwhile, argued that authorities could have continued using the drug.\nDr Anthony Cox, who researches drug safety at the UK's University of Birmingham, told the BBC it was a \"cascade of bad decision-making that's spread across Europe\".\nThe company says there is no evidence of an increased risk of clotting due to the vaccine.\nIt said it had received 37 reports of blood clots out of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the EU and UK as of 8 March.\nThese figures were \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines\", it said.\nProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group which developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, told the BBC on Monday that there was \"very reassuring evidence that there is no increase in a blood clot phenomenon here in the UK, where most of the doses in Europe [have] been given so far\".\nBritish Health Secretary Matt Hancock this week urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\".

      "tags": "Companies,Ed Miliband,Steel industry",
      "text": "The government should step in to save Liberty Steel, says shadow business secretary Ed Miliband\nHe said the situation was \"urgent and worrying\" and nothing should be off the table, including nationalisation, to save thousands of jobs in a key strategic industry. \n\"These are crucial jobs for communities up and down this country,\" he said.\nLiberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK, including at Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport, and employs 5,000 people.\nMr Miliband told the BBC the plants are \"a crucial part of our strategic infrastructure, are crucial for the aerospace sector to automotive. Let's hope that Liberty steel can find that the refinancing that it's looking for but the government needs a plan B to make sure whatever happens, these jobs are saved.\"\nThe collapse of the company's main financial backer, Greensill Capital, last week has sparked grave concerns about the future of those jobs. \nMr Miliband said the government needed a to consider every option available to save the company. \"If there's one lesson we learned from this pandemic it's that our strategic infrastructure, our resilience really matters. And steel is a key part of our strategic infrastructure and resilience. \n\"We cannot afford to let these jobs go. Government has got to make sure it doesn't happen.\"\nMr Miliband added it was a demonstration of the need for a comprehensive industrial strategy; a strategy he accused the government of abandoning with the recent abolition of the industrial strategy council of senior business leaders.  \n\"We absolutely need an industrial strategy. Because we face such massive challenges as a country like the green transition, we have to undertake. And we can only do that without proper partnership between public and private sectors. Now, that does mean a clear roadmap, government showing the direction which is going, it also means public finance.\"\nSpeaking to The Times, the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, hinted that the government could intervene in the Liberty Steel crisis.\n\"We have done in the past. I think Liberty Steel is consonant with our decarbonisation agenda. I think it's a fundamentally good product... I can't anticipate or guarantee forms of intervention.\n \"The management has their own plan as well and I've got to see how that works out.\"\nOn Tuesday, the government announced a plan to cut industrial carbon emissions by two-thirds by 2035 - allocating a billion pounds of money announced in the government's ten point plan to hit net zero by 2050.\nIts strategy for fostering private investment in offshore wind is a roaring success and we have just witnessed the largest state intervention in the private sector outside of wartime. \nI asked Mr Milliband whether the Labour Party had been outflanked on green investment and state intervention? He unsurprisingly disagreed. \n\"We're generating the offshore wind here but we're not manufacturing many turbines here, the world leader is Denmark. Why are they the world leader, because they have a proper industrial strategy, where government is willing to put its might alongside the private sector behind it. \n\"Businesses are deeply frustrated, angry even, that the government has torn up the work that was being done on an industrial strategy. If the government doesn't want to have one, we'll have one. Because we know we've got to work with business on the challenges we face.\"\nHe insisted that the people who presided over the last ten years were unlikely to be able to deliver transformation over the next ten years - and Britain was falling behind the US, France and Germany on investment. \nMany businesses do indeed say they liked the old industrial strategy - the sector deals that made them feel the government was holding their hand while setting big policy targets. Some feel we have destinations but no detailed map. But it is also true that the government has a trump card to play in this debate - and we can expect them to play it often. \nMinisters and officials point to the vaccine response as an exemplar of how the public and private sector can work together successfully. They also use it as an example of how a government freed from the meeting rooms of Brussels can be nimble when required. \nWhen asked what the UK will do with its supposed new found freedoms, insiders will find it difficult to make a list but would point to the vaccine success of \"knowing it when you see it\". \nThat argument works less well of course on the government's PPE procurement and the eye watering sums poured into test and trace.\nThe government insists it does have an industrial strategy - it just doesn't want to call it that. It prefers a \"plan for growth\", \"build back better\" - and it prefers its run by Number 10 and the Treasury rather than the Department for Business. It also says it is monitoring the Liberty Steel situation very closely. \nLabour's dilemma perhaps is that it has never had to fight against a conservative party in a situation like this. Unprecedented intervention in the private sector, running a huge budget deficit and choosing to pay for some of it with a whopping hike in business taxes in 2023. \n It's been a strange year for everyone.

      "text": "Nasa's Perseverance rover has extended its Martian playlist.\nAfter sending back sounds of the wind and the zaps of its laser, the robot has just recorded the noise coming from its metal wheels as they clank across the planet's rocky surface.\n\"If I heard these sounds driving my car, I'd pull over and call for a tow,\" joked Dave Gruel, a lead engineer working the rover's cameras and microphones.\nPerseverance has two recording devices.\nThey were included on the robot to give the public a keener sense of what Mars is like, but they also have some scientific value. The nature of the sounds says something about the physical properties of the surface - how hard or how soft the rocks are, for example.\nThe newly released recording was made during a 27m drive by Perseverance on 7 March. The media at the top of this page is an abridged version of a sequence that runs for 16 minutes in raw form.\nSounds come across a little differently on Mars compared with Earth, due to the much reduced air pressure and contrasting composition. The sounds can seem somewhat muffled. The noise from the wheels is certainly loud, though.\nIn amongst the clatter, engineers say they can hear a kind of scratching noise, the source of which they are still trying to identify.\nThey are not sure if this is electromagnetic interference from one of the rover's electronics boxes or just another aspect of the general rattle that is produced in the interaction between the robot's mobility system and the surface.\nPerseverance landed in Mars' Jezero Crater on 18 February. Most of its time since has been spent testing all its systems, tools and instruments.\nAn immediate goal is a helicopter experiment. The rover brought a small chopper with it from Earth.\nThe vehicle is looking for a suitable stretch of terrain where the 2kg device, called Ingenuity, can be put safely on the ground. At present, the aircraft is slung beneath Perseverance's belly.\nNasa says engineers have now identified a likely location which they will discuss in more detail in a briefing on Tuesday next week.\nThe team behind Ingenuity will be given 30 Martian days, or sols (31 Earth days), to conduct up to five test flights.\nOnce complete, the main mission can begin. Perseverance is on Mars to search for signs of past life and to collect rocks that can be sent back to Earth later this decade.\nAn early destination for the robot will be the remains of a delta -  a structure built up from the silt and sand dumped by a river as it enters a wider body of water.\nIn Jezero's case, this wider body was very likely a crater-wide lake that existed billions of years ago."

Some may wish to continue online and or drive-in services for the time being due to their own local situation.\"\nThe bishops also noted the \"strong working relationship\" between the four churches. \nCatholic bishops in Northern Ireland emphasised the need for \"continued caution\" and a \"rigorous application of all mitigations and safeguards required\" to ensure a safe return to Mass on 26 March.\nThey said public worship would only be after a \"thorough risk assessment\", which means some parishes may decide to delay reopening for worshippers \"until a later date\".\nAnnouncing relaxations to coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday, First Minister Arlene Foster said she and the deputy first minister had spoken with Church leaders about their desire to resume public worship. \nMrs Foster has defended the pathway out of lockdown, which has been criticised by some business leaders for its lack of dates. \nSpeaking at the assembly, she said: \"We need to continue to acknowledge how much people need hope and solace... we acknowledge the risk involved and the mitigations required by the churches. \n\"Some places of worship will find it easier to continue with online services, of course. We know this will be taken forward carefully and we have been grateful to leaders across all faiths who have worked closely with us on a voluntary basis.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nAn expected reduction in the UK's Covid vaccine supply next month is due to a delay in the delivery of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses from India. The shipment - produced by the Serum Institute of India - has been held up by four weeks, the BBC has been told. The Department of Health is insisting it is still on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July - however the NHS in England has since been told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April. The Serum Institute, the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines which has agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, has delivered half of those and it will \"try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India\".\nHundreds of \"do not attempt resuscitation\" decisions made during the pandemic were not agreed in discussion with the person or their family, a report says. Health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, says individuals' human rights may have been breached in 508 cases and is calling for urgent improvements in care planning. It found decisions made since March 2020 were not agreed in discussion with the person or their family even though the NHS says families should be consulted.\nA digital certificate to kick-start foreign travel should be given to citizens across the EU \"without discrimination\", officials say. Vaccine passports have faced opposition from some EU member states over concerns they might be discriminatory. But the aim of these certificates is to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus, to travel within the EU. The 27 member states will decide how they will be used. \nFormer US President Donald Trump's net worth dropped by about $700m to $2.3bn (\u00a31.65bn) during his time in office, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Covid-19 pandemic hit his fortunes hard, with Mr Trump's office buildings, branded hotels and resorts losing revenue and falling in value. His aircraft fleet and golf courses have also seen drops in their value. Mr Trump is currently under criminal investigation into his financial affairs and his family business.\nOne and a half million under-18s will need support with their mental health as a result of the pandemic, the National Association of Head Teachers has said. BBC London visited the Orion Primary School in north London to find out how children there have been coping. The pupils drew pictures describing their experiences of lockdown and said being able to attend school and see their friends again had made them happy.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC),Accountancy,Kwasi Kwarteng,KPMG",
      "text": "Proposals to reduce the dominance of the \"Big Four\" accountancy firms and scrap the industry regulator have been unveiled by the government.\nThe aim is to improve regulatory standards after high profile corporate failures such as Carillion and BHS.\nAlso, company directors will face more responsibility to ensure accounts are accurate, or face tougher penalties.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the changes would help restore confidence in business.\nThere will now be a 16-week consultation on the proposals.\nThe business of auditing companies' accounts, and ensuring they are a fair reflection of their financial health, is dominated by four accountancy firms: KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY.\nHowever, there is concern that providing both accountancy and auditing services creates a conflict of interest.\nUnder the new rules, large companies would be required to use smaller auditing firms to conduct part of their annual audit, in an attempt to dilute the Big Four's dominance.\nThe new proposals would require KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY to make their audits more rigorous.\nThey could face a cap on the number of companies on the FTSE 350 index they may audit, if those improvements don't go far enough.\nThe government said last year almost a third of audits inspected on the FTSE 350 were in need of improvement.\nThe largest private companies in the UK would also face greater scrutiny from regulators under the new rules.\nSir Donald Brydon, a former chairman of the London Stock Exchange who authored a government review on improving corporate governance, said the new proposals would help to \"restore trust\" and that similar measures had worked in the US.\n\"So many of us depend on business for our living and our life, whether it is suppliers, customers, employees or shareholders,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.  \n\"What really matters is that the information on which those people make their decisions is accurate and honest, and an auditor's role is to ensure as far as humanly possible, at a reasonable cost, that information is truthful.\"\nHe added: \"People want to know three things about a business - how is it performing, is it honestly run, and will it survive. And auditors are key to answering all three.\" \nMr Kwarteng said: \"Restoring business confidence, but also people's confidence in business, is crucial to repairing our economy and building back better from the pandemic.\n\"When big companies go bust, the effects are felt far and wide with job losses and the British taxpayer picking up the tab.\n\"It's clear from large-scale collapses like Thomas Cook, Carillion and BHS that Britain's audit regime needs to be modernised with a package of sensible, proportionate reforms.\"\nA new accountancy watchdog, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA), would be launched to implement the changes, replacing the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). It would have legal powers to force auditors and companies to resubmit their accounts without the need for court action.\nUK companies and directors also face curbs on dividend and bonus payments if there is misconduct, they publish inaccurate accounts, or have insufficient cash reserves. Directors of failed firms could also see their bonuses clawed back up to two years after a pay award is made, to clamp down on \"rewards for failure\", the government added.\nBy providing more transparency over company accounts the new rules should also help deter firms that could be facing insolvency  from making largescale dividend and bonus payments. They will also be required to produce \"resilience statements\".\nAccountancy firms welcomed the proposals, with Jon Holt, head of audit at KPMG UK, saying: \"It is an ambitious package of strategic reform. Prioritising and clarifying the audit reform agenda is an important step to rebuild trust in the profession.\" \nKevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner at PwC UK, also stressed that importance of \"driving trust and confidence\" in the profession.\n\"We welcome comprehensive consultation. For lasting change, we need a coherent set of measures and for all parties to play their part. Listening to the views of a wide range of businesses, investors and other interested parties will be key to achieving this,\" Mr Ellis said.  \nThe proposals also won the support of employers' groups. The CBI saying the reforms would \"inject focus and momentum behind efforts to maintain the highest possible standards\".\nThe British Chambers of Commerce said the changes would be a \"positive step\". But Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics, cautioned: \"Government and regulators must tread carefully to avoid unintended consequences, including adding to the already onerous cost burden on firms and undermining the UK's global reputation as great place to do business.\" "

Our taskforce in the executive will not just look at the health data, which of course is important, but the economic and societal data as well\n\"We're doing that on a rolling basis.\n\"Last year, when we had that flexibility built into our plan, it allowed us to move a little faster that some other jurisdictions and my hope and desire is that that will be the case in this case as well.\"\nNorthern Ireland has been in lockdown since 26 December.\nMeasures announced on Tuesday to ease the lockdown include the return of all primary school children to school from Monday, other school groups from 12 April and more people allowed to meet outdoors from 1 April.\nGarden centres can resume click-and-collect services from 1 April and other non-essential shops from 12 April.\nRetail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" that the executive had given \"no dates, no timeframes, no nothing\" for businesses to reopen.\n\"It is exceptionally frustrating when we are putting forward ideas on how we can make our high streets safe, cut down transmission levels of the virus and reassure consumers, but nothing is being done,\" Mr Roberts said.\n\"If we don't get some indication of when our economy is allowed to reopen, then we're going to off-the-scale unemployment, business failure, huge off-the-scale levels of mental health problems in our society.\"\nDawn McLaughlin, chief executive of Derry Chamber, said some business felt like they are no further forward. \n\"What we would ask the executive is to provide a bit of hope to our members and to businesses throughout NI, give them some clarity in terms of indicative dates, not necessarily actual dates, but at least give them time to plan, time to organise,\" she said.\n\"A bit of clarity, a bit of time - we all understand if the numbers go the wrong way it'll have to be postponed, but give them that hope and that clarity.\"\nWilliam Montgomery, who runs a garden centre in County Armagh, said the return of click and collect was a small but welcome step.\n\"Realistically we're probably only going to be looking at 10%-15% of sales probably that we would normally do at this time of year,\" he said.\n\"But it will get us through, it will get rid of some stock that we have there that currently we can't sell.\"\nNo new Covid-19 related deaths were reported in NI on Wednesday. \nThe Department of Health said there had been 161 new coronavirus cases within the last 24 hours.\nIn the Republic of Ireland the Irish Department of Health announced 17 more deaths related to Covid-19 on Wednesday. \nNine of those deaths occurred in March, four in February, and four occurred in January or earlier bringing the total to 4,566 deaths overall.\nThere were 557 more confirmed cases bringing the total number to 228,215 to date."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Donald Trump's net worth dropped by about $700m to $2.3bn (\u00a31.65bn) during his time as president, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic hit his fortunes hard, with Mr Trump's office buildings, branded hotels and resorts losing revenue and falling in value.\nHis fleet of planes and golf courses have also seen drops in their value.\nMr Trump is currently under a criminal investigation into his financial affairs and his family business.\nBloomberg analysed financial documents and other filings from May 2016 and January 2021 to calculate Mr Trump's wealth before and after he became US president.\nMr Trump's commercial real estate accounts for about three-quarters of his net worth. The office towers he owns or co-owns have seen big drops in valuations as more people work from home, a trend that could last in the long term.\nBloomberg, which provides financial news and data, estimates a 26% drop in the value of his main commercial property holdings.\nHe also owns, manages or licenses his name to about a dozen hotels and resorts, plus 19 golf courses.\nAlthough golf has become popular during the pandemic as a socially distanced outdoor sport, Mr Trump's two courses in Scotland have consistently lost money, filings show. \nAfter the Capitol Hill siege in January, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) of America ended an agreement to host its 2022 championship tournament at Mr Trump's New Jersey golf course, saying it would hurt the group's brand. \nDeutsche Bank, the only bank willing to lend to him after his bankruptcies in the 1990s, also said after the riots that it would not do business with him again.\nMr Trump also owns a fleet of planes that includes a Boeing 757. These planes are decades old and have been marked down in value over the years, according to financial disclosures seen by Bloomberg. \nSeven planes were valued at around $59m in 2015 and five were valued at about $6.5m in 2020. The value of Mr Trump's aircraft has dropped over the years, in part because he has sold some of his fleet. \nDuring his presidency, Mr Trump's finances were regularly in the spotlight and he has been very secretive about how much tax he pays.\nLast month the Supreme Court ordered Mr Trump to hand over his tax returns and other financial records to prosecutors in New York.\nFor months they have been trying to obtain eight years' worth of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns.\nThe investigation was originally started in 2018 to examine the Trump Organization's role in hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had had affairs with Mr Trump.\nAs a former president, Donald Trump can expect to sign some lucrative media deals to recover some of his lost wealth, such as a post-presidential memoir.\nBarack and Michelle Obama reportedly got paid about $65m for their memoirs, while Bill Clinton earned a $15m advance for his 2004 book. \nBloomberg says the most obvious way Mr Trump can profit post-presidency is with a news channel or social media platform that would appeal to his 74m voters in the 2020 election."

      "text": "Countries around the world are celebrating St Patrick's Day on Wednesday, with online events replacing traditional parades.\nLandmarks across the globe turned green for the day in honour of Ireland's patron saint.\nLarge gatherings were ruled out in many parts of the world due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin were cancelled for the second year in a row.\nHowever events marking the day took place across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which are being streamed online.\nThey included an online disco and live music events in Belfast, while more than 100 online events were held in the Republic of Ireland and broadcast around the world.\nTraditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM).\nThat long-standing tradition continued this year, albeit virtually. \nThe bowl was placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday.\nThe two leaders discussed, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.\nThey might not have been in the same room but President Biden and the taoiseach were still able to virtually wish each other a Happy Saint Patrick's Day.\nIt was a day of a firsts - a first for Joe Biden as president who pledged his support for the Good Friday Agreement.\nReferring to the Good Friday Agreement he said: \"We strongly support y and think it is critically important that we maintain it. The political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples.\"\nAnd it was also Mr Martin's first St Patrick's Day as taoiseach.\nHe said he wanted to move forward with a \"positive relationship with the UK.\"\n\"That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. \n\"That in turn then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island - goals I know you support,\" he added.\nNorthern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers also held a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. \nA range of issues were covered during the meeting including progress on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery, as well as highlighting regional strengths and priorities.\nMichelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster Ministers also expressed hope that President Biden and Vice President Harris would visit Northern Ireland at some point in the future.\nHundreds of extra police officers were on duty in Northern Ireland for a \"robust\" response to St Patrick's Day rule breakers.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster had warned that St Patrick's Day \"must be different\" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Garda\u00ed (police) had a significant operation in place to deal with planned protests in Dublin city centre. \nSixteen people were arrested in the city for failing to comply with directions from garda to abide by Covid-19 regulations.\nThe Queen extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as 10 years ago.\"\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, with a record number of places taking part.\nSome 690 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\nAlongside more famous landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Leaning Tower of Pisa were more quirky ones such as an abandoned sauna tilted on its side beside a lake in Finland, and a solar power-generated giraffe in Mozambique.\nIn Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River but the city's mayor decided to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. \nSt Patrick lived in the 5th Century and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\nSt Patrick's Day started as a religious feast to celebrate his work, but it has grown to be an international festival of all things Irish."

      "tags": "Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "The government is to cut grants aimed at encouraging people to buy electric vehicles in a move that has been criticised by the motor industry.\nThe Department for Transport will reduce the grant from \u00a33,000 to \u00a32,500 and restrict it to cars under \u00a335,000.\nBut Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it is \"the wrong move at the wrong time\".\nIt said the decision goes against the government's zero emissions ambitions.\n\"This sends the wrong message to the consumer, especially private customers, and to an industry challenged to meet the government's ambition to be a world leader in the transition to zero emission mobility,\" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.\nFord of Britain said the grant cut was \"disappointing and is not conducive to supporting the zero emissions future we all desire.\"\n\"Robust incentives - both purchase and usage incentives - that are consistent over time are essential if we are to encourage consumers to adopt new technologies,\" the carmaker's chairman Graham Hoare said.\nBusiness group the CBI also criticised the move, saying \"this is the wrong time to stunt a green recovery by making a sudden change to the grants on offer.\"\nMatthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said \"we must avoid sending mixed messages to consumers and businesses.\"\n\"Switching to an electric vehicle still has many barriers, including high upfront costs and availability of reliable charging points. \n \"A clear and consistent pathway for incentives will ensure business can continue to deliver the government's ambitions for reducing transport emissions,\" Mr Fell added.\n'Increasing choice'\nThe government said that higher-priced vehicles are typically bought by drivers who can afford to switch to electric vehicles without a subsidy.\nIt said the changes will allow funding for the grant to go further.\nTransport minister Rachel Maclean said: \"We want as many people as possible to be able to make the switch to electric vehicles.\" \n\"The increasing choice of new vehicles, growing demand from customers, and rapidly rising number of chargepoints means that while the level of funding remains as high as ever, given soaring demand, we are re-focusing our vehicle grants on the more affordable zero emission vehicles.\"\nThe government will also alter how it calculates the plug-in van grant, and change the eligibility for the grant to vehicles that are able to travel for 60 miles without any emissions.\nThe plug-in car grant was introduced a decade ago, and was designed to reduce the price of electric cars, which generally cost more to make than petrol or diesel equivalents, to encourage more people to buy them.\nElectric cars are expensive to make and expensive to buy compared with traditional vehicles.\nThe grant was introduced to reduce the price difference between electric models and conventional cars, to encourage people to buy them. \nThe government's argument is that now battery prices are falling, and with a range of cheaper cars coming onto the market, the size and scope of the grant can be reined in, and the available money can be better spent.\nThe market has certainly changed since the grant was introduced a decade ago. Electric car sales are now rising rapidly and relatively affordable vehicles with a practical range are becoming much more common.\nWith the government now planning to ban the sale of new non-hybrid petrol and diesel cars from 2030, it seems to be relying less on incentives and more on compulsion to bring about change.\nLess carrot and more stick.\nBut the industry believes this approach is wrong and that reducing the grant threatens to choke off the growth in electric car use, at a time when many other countries are offering much bigger subsidies.\nSince 2018, the government has been narrowing the scope of the grant, bringing the level down in stages from \u00a35,000 and tightening the eligibility criteria.\nIt said in 2018 that it wanted to gradually get rid of the grants. In March 2020, it extended the grant schemes for three years with \u00a3582m funding.\nCharging concerns\nSales of electric cars have increased rapidly over the past year, but remain a relatively small proportion of all cars sold.\nThe government says that by 2030 it wants to ban the sale of new cars powered only by petrol or diesel engines.\nAs part of a plan to make the UK carbon neutral, it unveiled a \u00a32.8bn package to support the switch to greener cars, including \u00a31.3bn for charging infrastructure.\nBut in February, the Policy Exchange think tank said the rollout of charging points had fallen behind what was needed to meet the planned ban on diesel and petrol cars.\nIt said there was a risk of \"charging blackspots\" in small towns and rural areas unless the rollout speeds up.\nPrice comparison site Carwow said cutting the subsidy for electric vehicles was a \"strange direction\" for the UK to take.\n\"For the most part, electric vehicle variants still carry a notable price premium versus  traditional petrol or diesel variants,\" said Sepi Arani, commercial lead at Carwow.\n\"The lowering of the cap to \u00a335,000 limits the support to a much smaller proportion of cars, which in turn will no doubt have an effect on the UK's electric vehicle adoption.\n\"It's difficult to see why the grant scheme does not instead work on a tapered scheme, where the amount offered is staggered for different price points instead,\" Mr Arani added."

Their public comments have made that clear.\n\"So this very partisan leak tonight before they've actually finalised the report is not that surprising.\n\"Let's wait and see the final report, but more importantly the question of whether or not I breached the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton and I hope and expect he will publish that report soon.\"\nMr Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer, has been specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code, which says that any minister who knowingly misleads parliament would be \"expected to offer their resignation\".\nHis inquiry is separate from the committee and is also expected to publish its report in the coming days. \nThe cross-party committee includes four SNP MSPs, two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent Andy Wightman.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said the committee was still finalising its report, and it would not make any comment until it was published.\nMs Sturgeon and Mr Salmond - her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader - have both taken part  in lengthy evidence sessions in front of the committee in recent weeks. \nMr Salmond claimed to have been the victim of a \"malicious scheme\" drawn up by figures within the SNP who are close to Ms Sturgeon. \nBut Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that any suggestion there had been conspiracy were \"absurd\", and insisted she had not been out to \"get\" Mr Salmond. \nShe told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that Mr Salmond and his \"cronies\" In the \"old boys' club\" had been spinning \"conspiracy theories\" which opposition politicians had bought into.\nIt came after Conservative MP David Davis - a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond - used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to read out messages that he suggested showed a \"concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" against the former first minister.\nNicola Sturgeon did not intervene in the investigation into harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to. \nAlex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018. \nNicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough. \nHer testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private. \nThe opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account. \nWith the committee divided along party lines over the first minister's conduct, the conclusions of James Hamilton - the Irish lawyer who's independently examining the evidence - gain ever greater importance. \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"All the evidence points to the fact that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, misled the people of Scotland and has to resign.\n\"I have said for weeks that evidence against Nicola Sturgeon has been mounting, it has been growing and it is clear she has breached the ministerial code. \n\"You cannot continue as first minister of Scotland if you have misled Parliament and breached the ministerial code.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it would be \"incredibly serious\" if the committee concluded that the first minister had misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code. \nHe added: \"This is about the integrity of our Scottish Parliament and upholding standards in public life.\"\nAnd you can find out more about the background to this story on Panorama: Salmond v Sturgeon, available on iPlayer now."

      "text": "There is no evidence the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots, say UK and EU regulators after a \"thorough and careful review\". \nThe MHRA and the EMA say people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised, despite some countries pausing use. \nBut anyone with a headache lasting more than four days after vaccination should seek medical advice, as a precaution. \nThe same advice applies if someone develops unusual bruising. \nThat is because the regulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain. \nIt is this type of clot that triggered some European countries to pause rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nIn the UK, five cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT), among 11 million people who have received the vaccine, occurred in men aged between 19 and 59. One of these was fatal. \nThe EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT. \nCSVT can occur naturally and no link to the vaccine has been established. The patients also had low blood platelet counts - cells involved with clotting. \nCovid infection can make clots more likely.\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said regulators would continue to closely monitor the situation and people should have the vaccine when it is their turn: \"The public can have every confidence in the thoroughness of our review.\"\nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, said the gains from getting vaccinated were clear.\n\"Given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these events, the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with the latest data suggesting an 80% reduction in hospitalisation and death from Covid disease, far outweigh any possible risks,\" he said.\nProduct information on the vaccine will be updated to include information about rare blood clots. \nEMA executive director, Emer Cooke, said: \"Drawing attention to these possible rare conditions and providing information to health care professionals and vaccinated people will help to spot and mitigate any possible side effects.\"\nThe EMA review, based on data from around 20 million people vaccinated, concluded: \nIt said any of the following symptoms after vaccination should prompt a medical check as a precaution:\nThese occur very rarely and are different to the common side-effects people can expect with any vaccine, such as some tenderness where the injection was given.

      "text": "There is no evidence the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots, say UK and EU regulators after a \"thorough and careful review\". \nThe MHRA and the EMA say people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised, despite some countries pausing use. \nBut anyone with a headache lasting more than four days after vaccination should seek medical advice, as a precaution. \nThe same advice applies if someone develops unusual bruising. \nThat is because the regulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain. \nIt is this type of clot that triggered some European countries to pause rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nIn the UK, five cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT), among 11 million people who have received the vaccine, occurred in men aged between 19 and 59. One of these was fatal. \nThe EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT. \nCSVT can occur naturally and no link to the vaccine has been established. The patients also had low blood platelet counts - cells involved with clotting. \nCovid infection can make clots more likely.\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said regulators would continue to closely monitor the situation and people should have the vaccine when it is their turn: \"The public can have every confidence in the thoroughness of our review.\"\nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, said the gains from getting vaccinated were clear.\n\"Given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these events, the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with the latest data suggesting an 80% reduction in hospitalisation and death from Covid disease, far outweigh any possible risks,\" he said.\nProduct information on the vaccine will be updated to include information about rare blood clots. \nEMA executive director, Emer Cooke, said: \"Drawing attention to these possible rare conditions and providing information to health care professionals and vaccinated people will help to spot and mitigate any possible side effects.\"\nThe EMA review, based on data from around 20 million people vaccinated, concluded: \nIt said any of the following symptoms after vaccination should prompt a medical check as a precaution:\nThese occur very rarely and are different to the common side-effects people can expect with any vaccine, such as some tenderness where the injection was given.

      "text": "Support in schools needs to be targeted to avoid trying to get children to \"catch up on everything\" when classes resume, according to researchers.\nSchools are yet to know the impact of months away from face-to-face teaching.\nCardiff University researcher Catherine Foster said children from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to have fallen behind while learning from home.\nThe Welsh government said the equivalent of about 2,000 extra full-time teaching staff had been hired.\nBut opposition parties have said classroom return plans lack detail.\nPrimary school children and some secondary pupils have returned to school after learning from home since before Christmas, but pupils will not all be back in class full time until 12 April. \nOn top of the face-to-face teaching missed this term, pupils also had to learn at home from March to July last year and many spent periods having to isolate, even when they were allowed back in class.\nDr Foster is part of a team at the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research and Data which has surveyed young people in years 7 to 12 about their home learning experiences.\nShe said international research suggested children had fallen behind in terms of educational attainment and \"the progress lost is even worse for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds\".\nResearch suggested many children would not have engaged with their school work and motivation could be a problem when they are back in class, but experiences would differ, she added.\n\"Everyone has lost something - it varies a lot. But if there's a focus on catching up and trying to say 'well you've got to catch-up on everything you've missed, plus the work you've got to do this year', it's not going to help\", she said\n\"There's a lot of logic in saying that maybe we should just be identifying what young people need to progress and focusing on filling in those particular gaps, rather than trying to chuck everything at them and expecting them to do two years in one.\"\nAt Ysgol y Ddraig in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, the school believes that working towards the core aims of Wales' new curriculum will help with addressing the effects of the pandemic on children.\nBut executive head teacher Ty Golding thinks talk of \"catching-up\" is not helpful.\nHe said: \"I think we're trying to avoid the term catch-up if I'm honest, because it does suggest that learning is a linear process by which if children miss a chunk of work they'll never be able to engage in that level of learning.\n\"Really for us at the moment it's about the social reconnection, it's about getting the children back into routines\".\nAt Ysgol Glan Morfa in Cardiff, Gethin Bickerton has been employed as a teaching assistant since autumn 2020, one of hundreds of extra staff employed through the Welsh government's Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards programme.\nBefore the pandemic, he was an actor travelling around schools helping children learn about figures from Welsh history.\nNow he uses those skills to do role play with children to improve communication and help small groups with their reading.\n\"We have a mixture of pupils here. We have some who have engaged really well with online learning and those who can really engage with the work, but then we have the polar opposite,\" he said.\nMr Bickerton works with young children in the foundation phase where improving literacy is a key priority.\n\"The main focus at the moment is getting them back into some sort of routine and getting them back socialising with other people through the medium of Welsh - that's our main aim.\n\"But also going back to basics with some individuals as well, learning letters, words and forming sentences.\"\nLast summer, the Welsh government announced \u00a329m to fund 900 extra teaching staff, followed by a further \u00a372m investment announced earlier this month.\nIt said it had outstripped the recruitment target and so far the equivalent of around 2,000 extra full time staff had been employed.\nNew figures from the government showed that included 472 new full time teaching assistants and 248 new full time teachers, as well as hundreds of part time appointments and existing staff taking on extra hours.\nA spokesman said an evaluation of recruitment through Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards would be commissioned this year.  \nHe added: \"Initial data suggests the funding has supported the recruitment of mostly new, rather than existing, staff.\n\"1,508 new full-time equivalent posts have been recruited to, compared to 487 (FTE) posts created from increased hours for existing staff.\"\nBut opposition parties have said the plans failed to provide a longer-term vision.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said without a detailed roadmap for education recovery \"nobody's sure of how it will be spent and whether it will be spent effectively\".\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said a recovery plan needed to be part of \"an ambitious plan to invest in teaching\" in the long term.\n\"What we're hearing from the government is yet more announcements about funding but no plan about how that funding is going to be used.\""

      "text": "Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest computer-chip manufacturer, has warned of a \u201cserious imbalance\u201d in the semiconductor industry, as global shortages cause disruption.\nIt also said it might skip the launch of the next Galaxy Note smartphone, to streamline its lineup.\nThere are growing fears market shortages could slow economic recovery after coronavirus.\nEU, US and Chinese governments are seeking to boost production.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally,\u201d Samsung's co-chief executive and mobile chief, Koh Dong-jin, said at a shareholder meeting.\n\"It is hard to say the shortage issue has been solved 100%.\"\nSamsung was working with overseas partners to meet demand, he added.\nThe semiconductor shortage began last year, as the pandemic hit. \nSuffering from poor sales, car manufacturers cut their orders from the Chinese factories making computer chips.\nIn response, the chip supply from factories was transferred to other sectors that had high demands.\nAnd unable to retrieve cancelled orders when demand for cars grew, Volkswagen, Honda, Toyota and General Motors all had to reduce production. \nMeanwhile, as technology sales boomed, with people staying at home, the other sectors were also affected.\nNew graphics cards were scarce, Apple staggered the release of some iPhones, and the latest models of Xbox and PlayStation consoles are selling out each time a new stock is announced.\n\"The semiconductor manufacturers are working hard to fill the gaps in supply,\" Counterpoint Research partner Peter Richardson said.\n\"But it will take time before investment translates to more supply. \n\"This means that shortages for some products may continue for several months - possibly even in to 2022.\"\nHowever, most consumers were unlikely to feel the impact, unless buying a new car, he added.\nSamsung's release of a new Galaxy Note smartphone may now be delayed until 2022, Mr Koh signalled.\nAs a high-end model, \u201cit might be difficult to release\u201d, he said.\nAnother popular model, the Samsung Galaxy S21, was launched in January. \n\u201cIt could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year,\u201d Mr Koh added. \nQuilter Cheviot research analyst Ben Barringer said: \"Growing trade tensions between the US and China put the semiconductor industry in uncertainty, even before the pandemic.\n\"This shortage illustrates how important certain countries have become in terms of supply chain - and how important access to semiconductors is.\"\nAnd last month's closure of its chip-fabrication plant by adverse weather conditions in Texas had exacerbated Samsung's problems.\nTaiwanese research firm TrendForce estimated the shutdown could reduce global smartphone production by 5% in the second quarter of this year.\n\"They are trying to differentiate between absolute demands and nice-to-haves,\" Mr Barringer added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland is to get 500,000 fewer vaccine doses over the next month due to UK supply issues.\nHowever, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the country remains on track to meet its targets despite the shortfall.\nUK ministers have faced calls to explain why there would be a significant reduction in incoming vaccines from the end of March. \nIt is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs: \"We expect that over the next month we will have approximately 500,000 fewer doses than we had previously anticipated.\n\"For that reason there may be periods in April where we need to prioritise second doses.\"\nSecond doses should be administered within 12 weeks of a first dose.\nMs Sturgeon added that the government still intends to offer first doses to all people in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) top priority groups by mid-April.\nThis covers everyone aged over 50, unpaid carers and people with underlying health conditions.\nThe first minister said she \"still expects\" to offer a dose to all adults in the population by the end of July.\nShe added: \"We have always known that supplies will be subject to some volatility but the roll-out of the programme overall continues to be really encouraging and it does give us real cause for optimism now about the months ahead.\"\nEarlier, Scotland's national clinical director told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that targets should be met despite a \"significant reduction\" in UK vaccine supplies.\nProfessor Jason Leitch said ministers may have to think about \"who comes next and when they come next\" after April. \nHe added: \"We do not anticipate it will affect our second doses at all because we can prioritise them and just now they are mainly Pfizer.\"\nProf Leitch said there is no suggestion from either Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca that they will not be able to meet their end targets.\nThe national clinical director has made it clear that disruption to the vaccine supply will not affect two key targets.\nAll those over 50 or with underlying health conditions should still get their first jab by mid April, and the whole of the adult population should still be offered a jab by July.\nOne big question is when people in their 40s with no underlying health conditions - who may have been assuming they would be vaccinated in mid to late April - will now get their jab.\nAnother is whether disruption to the supply will have any effect on the easing of lockdown.\nAs the plan was to vaccinate over-50s by mid April and it takes three weeks for someone to get as much protection as one dose offers, it would seem unlikely that there will be any effect on the changes planned for 5 and 26 April.\nBut will progress be sufficient to allow other restrictions to ease in May and June as hoped?\nThe groups who will be vaccinated by mid-April account account for 99% of Covid deaths and the overwhelming majority of hospital admissions.\nBut with a growing amount of evidence that vaccination also reduces transmission, immunising younger people will also play a part in keeping case numbers down and providing even more protection to those most at risk.\nIt will be well worth watching the numbers in the coming weeks.  \nThe UK government said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for the expected slow down.\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC that UK supplies would be lower \"than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks\", but this was expect to increase in April.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said the supply issues meant efforts would focus on the first phase of the programme to vaccinate the over 50s.\nSecond doses for those immunised earlier in the year would also be prioritised\nThe Bristol University academic told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that phase two - to vaccinate the remaining adult population - would move forward when supplies were restored.\nProf Finn said: \"We have seen this in the past with other vaccines. Because they are biological agents rather than straightforward drugs they are more difficult to manufacture at scale.\n\"So we always try and make sure that we have got more than one supplier for vaccination against any particular disease.\"\nProf Finn said the issues should only result in a \"partial interruption\" to UK's vaccination programme and said it remains \"on track\".\nThe Scottish government said that \"appointments will be fulfilled\" for anyone already scheduled to have their first dose or second dose.  \nA spokesman added: \"Supplies of the vaccine have dipped before and our vaccination programme will continue to manage the stock available to get vaccines into arms as fast as possible.\"\nOn Wednesday it was announced that more than two million people in Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine.\nThe Scottish government said the milestone meant that 44% of the eligible population had been reached.\nLatest vaccination figures reveal 2,023,002 had received their first dose of the vaccine - an increase of 41,184 - as of 08:30 on Thursday.\nA total of 192,100 people have so far received a second dose of the vaccine, an increase of 10,221.\nThat means 51,405 received vaccinations on Wednesday."

Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta.\nCapt Baker said investigators were \"very confident\" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. \nThe identities of the victims have not yet been made public. Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. \nAuthorities say it is too early in the investigation to know if the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity.\nThe advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, said it was not clear \"whether or not the shootings were related or motivated by hate. But right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian-American community that must be addressed\".\nIt called the shootings \"an unspeakable tragedy\" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has \"been reeling from high levels of racist attacks\".\n\"A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,\" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that she had been in communication with the White House.  \nBen Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: \"Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism.\"\nAtlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked.\nThe New York Police Department's counter-terrorism branch said that while there was no known connection to New York city, it would \"be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the city out of an abundance of caution\".\nThe police department in Seattle also said it would increase patrols and outreach to support its Asian-American community. \nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: \"Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence.\"\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. \"We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,\" he said. \n\"We will stand up for the right of our fellow Americans, Korean Americans, to be safe, to be treated with dignity.\"\nThe White House said Mr Biden had been briefed on the \"horrific\" shootings. \nData compiled by the Pew Research Center"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, Boris Johnson has said, adding he will be receiving it himself on Friday. \nThe benefits of the vaccine preventing Covid far outweighed any risks, the prime minister said, as he urged people to take up the jab when offered.\nIt comes after UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the Covid vaccine caused blood clots.\nMr Johnson also said delays to vaccine supply next month would not affect England's roadmap out of lockdown.\n\"The progress along the road to freedom remains unchecked,\" he told a Downing Street briefing, after NHS England warned vaccine supplies would be reduced in April.\nProf Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, told the briefing the Covid vaccines were \"very effective\" against what remained a \"very dangerous disease for many people\".\nHe added that there were \"real issues that we always have to think about with all drugs\", but they were \"so much smaller than the benefits of getting the vaccine\".\n\"The risk-benefit is really strongly in favour of getting vaccinated,\" he said.\nRegulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain, prompting some European countries to pause rollout.\nBut earlier, the MHRA and the EMA said people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised.\nFrance and Italy have since announced that they will resume using the jab.\nA phrase used repeatedly today is the risk-benefit ratio. But what does that mean?\nThe EU and UK regulators were unable to completely rule out the vaccine as a cause of rare blood clots that have been seen.\nBecause the clots are so rare, it is hard to tell if they are above the levels you would normally expect without vaccination.\nBut even if a link is proven - and there is no suggestion it will be - the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.\nThere have been 18 cases of this rare blood clot out of 20 million vaccinations in Europe. That's about one in a million.\nSomeone who is over the age of 75 and becomes infected with Covid has a one in nine chance of dying.\nEven in younger age groups the benefits are clear. Someone in their 40s has a one in 1,000 risk of dying.\nThe vaccines have been proved to be highly effective. They will save lives, rather than cost them.\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Johnson confirmed that supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been affected by a delayed shipment from the Serum Institute of India.\nAfter opening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April.\n\"There is a delay as I have described, as there are very frequently in vaccine rollout programmes,\" he said.\nHe put it down to \"various technical reasons\" and said the Indian government \"hasn't stopped any export\".\nThe Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries.\nEarlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest held up by four weeks.\nThe Serum Institute said: \"Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India.\"\nIts chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been \"directed to prioritise the huge needs of India\".\nHe has also raised concerns about raw material shortages, attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines, such as specialised bags and filters."

But after her appointment at Teen Vogue, the posts resurfaced, leading to criticism. They were published on Instagram by journalist Diane Tsui.\n\"Outdone by [an] Asian #whatsnew,\" read one of Ms McCammond's earlier tweets.\n\"Give me a 2/10 on my chem [chemistry] problem, cross out all of my work and don't explain what I did wrong\u2026 thanks a lot stupid Asian T.A [teaching assistant] you're great,\" read another.\nReferencing the comments, Tsui wrote: \"Time and time again this shows that gatekeepers pay lip service to diversity. They don't believe anti-racism policies can and should include Asian Americans.\"\nThe tweets came under scrutiny at a time of heightened concern over a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans.\nOn Wednesday, six Asian-American women were killed in shootings in Atlanta, Georgia. Police have not yet confirmed if the shootings were racially motivated.\nTeen Vogue, which has a large following among teenagers and readers in their 20s, has built a reputation for explicit anti-racist and feminist journalism.\nIn one of its most famous pieces, it said in 2016 that US President Donald Trump was \"gaslighting America\".\nStaff at the magazine said Ms McCammond's appointment had threatened the outlet's core values.\n\"We've built our outlet's reputation as a voice for justice and change - we take immense pride in our work and in creating an inclusive environment,\" more than 20 staff wrote in a letter posted on Instagram.\n\"That's why we have written a letter to management at Cond\u00e9 Nast about the recent hire of Alexi McCammond as our new editor-in-chief in light of her past racist and homophobic tweets.\""

      "text": "There was a \"gross failure in basic care\" which led to a baby being starved of oxygen during birth, a coroner said.\nZak Ezra Carter died at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, two days after being born in July 2018 at Ystrad Fawr Hospital in Caerphilly county.\nGwent coroner Caroline Saunders said the monitoring of Zak and his mother Adele Thomas fell \"well below the standards expected\".\nShe said she was reassured the health board had taken steps to improve care.\nMs Thomas told the Newport hearing she felt \"scared\" and staff \"didn't care\" when she arrived to give birth on 20 July 2018.\nIn a statement to the inquest she described being turned away from the centre after going into labour on three occasions, before being admitted on the fourth.\nOn one occasion, she said she was told she might benefit from a walk around a nearby Tesco store.\nMs Thomas said she was initially offered paracetamol as pain relief at the midwife-led centre.\nShe described \"a lot of arguing between nurses\", one of whom was \"bolshie and rude and rough handled me\", adding the midwives \"did not appear to be in any rush\".\nWhen Zak was born, he was described as being \"white and pale\" and without a heartbeat. He did not cry and was taken away to a room for resuscitation.\nZak was transferred to the Royal Gwent Hospital where he died two days later.\nThe inquest heard Anthony Ridge Blackwell, an operating department practitioner from elsewhere in the hospital, was called to the birthing centre while paramedics were on their way.\nIn a statement, he said he was initially unable to access the unit because the doors were locked. \nHe said the \"lack of urgency was very apparent\" among staff, who he described as \"clearly upset and hugging each other\". \nMr Blackwell said he had to search for equipment among \"very limited resources\" before providing basic life support to Zak until paramedics arrived with more equipment.\nMidwife Theresa Ward told the coroner she came into the birthing room to assist midwife Lisa Gibson, who has been off work with stress since. \nShe said she had previously raised concerns about Ms Gibson's work with her superiors, and so on this occasion went in earlier than she normally would to help with the birth.\nIn a statement, Ms Gibson said she had retrospectively recorded observations taken during labour.\nMs Ward said the chart used to keep a record of the observations was not in the birthing room when she went in and \"didn't think to get it\".\nShe said she did not \"go in and take over\" but suggested Ms Thomas changed her position to help with the birth.\nAt one point, Ms Ward said she could not hear a heartbeat but Ms Gibson said she could faintly hear one. \nWhen she checked again five minutes later and still could not hear a heartbeat, Ms Ward said she told Ms Gibson to \"get the baby out\" by carrying out an episiotomy. \nThe coroner heard Ms Gibson spent time looking for the equipment and words were exchanged about the urgency.\nWhen she was asked why she did not take over, Ms Ward said she did not know why she did not.\nBefore the episiotomy was carried out, the inquest heard Zak's head and shoulders had emerged. \nMs Ward said once he was born she carried Zak to the resuscitation area and attempted to revive him until two men she did not know arrived and took over.\nShe said they did not have some of the equipment the men asked for and there were no drugs for babies on the birthing unit, only for mothers.\nDr David Phillips, a consultant anaesthetist, was asked to go to the birthing unit and said he found internal doors were locked and had received \"vague instructions\" about how to find Zak.\nDr Phillips told the coroner he did not recall \"any active resuscitation\" when he arrived, and Zak was grey and lifeless so he and Mr Blackwell immediately started CPR.\nHe said he was not given any handover or description of the circumstances of the birth, adding \"communication was quite difficult\".\nThe two members of staff seemed to be too emotional to help - one or both were in tears, he said.\nDr Phillips said some of the equipment he would have expected was not available until paramedics arrived.\nHe said a combination of CPR, adrenaline, defibrillation and intubation led to Zak's condition improving enough to be transferred to the Royal Gwent Hospital.\nJulia Sanders, a professor of clinical nursing and midwifery with Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, carried out an independent investigation into what happened. \nProf Sanders told the coroner there was nothing to indicate the birthing centre at Ystrad Fawr Hospital was an inappropriate place for Ms Thomas to give birth. \nDuring the first stage of labour, Prof Sanders said \"everything was progressing at a normal healthy rate and the fetal heart rate was recorded as completely normal\".\nBut she said it was \"highly unusual\" for the heart rate to not be documented contemporaneously, and the midwives had not been able to explain why they had not done so.\nLouise Taylor, a consultant midwife at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, told the hearing an action plan had been implemented to address many of the concerns raised by the hearing and investigation.\nRecording a narrative conclusion, Ms Saunders said the monitoring of Ms Thomas and her baby had \"fallen well below the standards expected\", leading to a \"gross failure in basic care\" of them in the later stages of labour.\nThe coroner said she was satisfied that when Dr Phillips arrived in the birthing unit \"no-one was resuscitating Zak and no-one voluntarily handed over what had happened\".\nHowever, she said she was reassured Aneurin Bevan University health board had taken steps to improve and monitor the care provided in the future.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Zak's parents said they were disappointed with the conclusion.\nMs Thomas, who has since gone on to have a baby girl, said she had felt helpless during Zak's birth.\nShe said she was \"angry\", \"bitter\" and sad following the \"dark few months of the immediate aftermath\".\nShe said the new baby had \"definitely saved us\".\nMs Thomas added: \"We think of Zak every single day... we'll never forget him.\"\nA spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: \"Our condolences and deepest sympathy continue to be with Zak's parents and family. \n\"This matter was fully investigated by the health Board and failings in care were identified. The investigation findings were shared openly with Zak's parents and the health board has sincerely apologised to them. \n\"We recognise however, that an apology will never make up for the pain and suffering they have experienced losing a child.\"\nIt said neither of the two midwives still worked for the health board but added it was \"determined to learn from this tragic incident to prevent this from happening again\".\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this news story, visit BBC Action Line for information on the support available to you."

      "tags": "Artemis,Nasa,Human spaceflight,Mississippi,Space Launch System (SLS)",
      "text": "Nasa has carried out a successful test on part of the most powerful rocket in existence - the Space Launch System (SLS).\nEngines on the rocket's \"core stage\" were kept running for more than eight minutes - simulating the time it takes the SLS to go from the ground to space.\nIt's the second such test for the biggest segment of the SLS, after an attempt in January shut down early.\nThe SLS is to send humans to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972.\nThe mission is part of Nasa's Artemis project, launched by the Trump administration in 2017.\nThe launcher consists of the orange core, with its four powerful RS-25 engines, and two boosters attached to the sides. \nThe test at Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis, Mississippi, began at 16:37 ET (20:37 GMT).  The core was attached to a giant structure called the B-2 test stand.\nA massive plume of exhaust expanded from the stand as the engines shook the ground. The cloud was so enormous, it was spotted from space by the Goes-16 satellite.\nAlthough the target was to fire the engines for eight minutes, teams from Nasa and prime contractor Boeing only had to keep them on for 250 seconds (four minutes) in order to gather all the engineering data they needed.\n\"It was a great day and a great test,\" said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk. \nThe chair of the US House Committee on Science, Space and Technology congratulated Nasa on the successful test. Texas democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson said: \"Achieving this significant milestone is a story of tenacity and dedication.\"\nShe added: \"Today's successful test brings us one step closer to returning American astronauts to the Moon in preparation for the human exploration of Mars.\"\nThe core that was part of Thursday's test will be used for the maiden flight of the SLS - currently scheduled for late 2021.\nIn the 1960s, the stand tested engines used in the massive Saturn V rocket that launched the Apollo astronauts to the Moon.\nJohn Shannon, Boeing's vice president and program manager for the SLS, told me before the first hotfire attempt: \"When the engines start and then throttle up, we will do what's called a gimbal profile at 60 seconds. The engine nozzles move in a pre-programmed set of movements.\"\nThis gimbal movement of the nozzles allows the rocket to be steered during flight.\n\"This is the most heavily instrumented vehicle we will ever fly so we will get a tremendous amount of engineering data on vibration and temperature and stress, acoustics,\" said Mr Shannon.\nBefore Thursday's hotfire, engineers filled the core stage with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million litres) of propellant.\nThat propellant consisted of liquid hydrogen, which is the rocket's fuel, and liquid oxygen, which helps the fuel burn. They react explosively inside the engines, generating super-heated water vapour from the exhaust.\nWhen they're fed to the engines, the propellants are at more than two hundred degrees below zero (F), but the exhaust that emerges is 6,000F (3,316C) - hot enough to boil iron.\nHundreds of thousands of gallons of water were directed into the flame bucket to cool the exhaust. In addition, tens of thousands of gallons were used to create a water \"curtain\" around the engines to suppress the noise generated when they fire for eight minutes.\nThis was done to protect the core stage from vibrations while it is anchored to the stand.\nThe RS-25s, built by California-based Aerojet Rocketdyne, are the same ones that powered the space shuttle.\nThe engines tested on Thursday contributed to 21 successful shuttle flights over the vehicle's 30-year operational history.\nTwo were used on the last space shuttle mission, STS-135 in 2011. One flew on the 1998 mission that launched the oldest person ever to go to space - US senator and Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time. The other was used on one of the flights to service the Hubble Space Telescope. \nThe engines were refurbished following shuttle missions, but they will be discarded after the maiden flight of the SLS later this year.\nThat mission, called Artemis-1, will send Nasa's next-generation crew vehicle, Orion, around the Moon to thoroughly test its systems.\nTom Whitmeyer, from Exploration Systems Development at Nasa, said it would take about a month to refurbish the core stage, after which it would be put on a ship to Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare it for launch.\nHere, it will be installed on a structure called the mobile launcher between the two booster rockets, completing the SLS vehicle.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Delays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April will not affect people getting their second doses or England's roadmap out of lockdown, the health secretary says.\nMatt Hancock told MPs: \"We are on track for the dates in the roadmap and there is no impact\" to the planned easing of coronavirus restrictions.\nThe UK's supply has been affected by a delayed shipment from India, he said.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the delays were \"a cause of concern\".\nNHS England warned of a reduction in supply in April in a letter sent to local health organisations on Wednesday.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock also revealed that a separate batch of 1.7 million doses was held up as it needed to be retested.\nHe said the government was still \"on track\" to deliver on the \"targets to offer the vaccine to everyone 50 and over, and all adults by the end of July\".\nHe added that he wanted to give reassurance that \"there will be no weeks in April with no first doses\".\n\"There will be no cancelled appointments as a result of supply issues - second doses will go ahead as planned,\" he said.\nAround 12 million people will receive their second dose next month, Mr Hancock said, adding that they could not be delayed as they had to be delivered within 12 weeks of the first dose.\nDates in England's roadmap for easing coronavirus restrictions are conditional on four tests being met, including the vaccine programme continuing to go to plan.\nMr Hancock said the roadmap had not been affected by the \"changes to vaccine supply that we've been detailing in the last 24 hours\".\nSir Keir said the vaccine rollout had \"been going really, really well\" and he was \"concerned about the delays\".\nSpeaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Edinburgh, he said: \"We need to get to the bottom of it and we need transparency from the government about what the problem is.\"\nAn expected reduction in the UK's supply in April is partly due to a delay in the delivery from the Serum Institute of India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses, which has been held up by four weeks.\nA spokesperson for the Serum Institute said: \"Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India.\"\nMore than 25 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, while around 1.7 million have had a second jab.\nAfter opening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April.\nThe Scottish government has said it is \"confident\" vaccine targets will be met, while the governments in Wales and Northern Ireland said they were examining how their own vaccine programmes could be affected.\nThe rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues.   \nPfizer, which produces its vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track.\nThe UK has also approved a third vaccine, made by Moderna, and Mr Hancock said he is expecting supplies \"in the coming weeks\".\nMore than 400 million doses of Covid vaccines have been ordered by the UK, including jabs made by Valneva, GlaxoSmithKline, Novavax and Janssen, which are yet to be approved. \nPredicting what supply is available in the future is difficult. Vaccine production is a biological process so manufacturers can never absolutely guarantee how much will be available.\nWhen you are relying on supplies from abroad there's an added element of complexity.\nThe UK only has two plants that are currently producing an approved vaccine - both make the AstraZeneca jab. Stocks of Pfizer come from Belgium. Both these supply routes are currently delivering what has been forecast.\nA deal was done with India to supply 10 million doses. But it was always made clear the exact date of shipment could not be absolutely guaranteed.\nThe government had understood the full shipment would arrive in time for mid-March and felt it needed to get vaccination clinics ready to do extra doses. They have now had to be stood down.\nIt comes after expectations were ramped up at the weekend after briefing to the media that the target to offer all adults a jab by the end of July could be hit a month early.\nThose hopes now seem to have been dashed. Another reminder of just how fragile supply is.\nThe Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries.\nIts chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been \"directed to prioritise the huge needs of India\".\nHe has also raised concerns about raw material shortages, attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines, such as specialised bags and filters.\nEarlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest delayed for several weeks.\nOn Monday NHS sources said there would be a big increase in the number of people being offered vaccinations in the coming days after the UK received the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India.\nProf Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said over the next two weeks the NHS would be pushing on with vaccinating over-50s and vulnerable people while it had a \"bumper supply\". \nHe said the announcement of a shortage was \"disappointing\" news and it would impact \"the group we were hoping to start on in April which is the people under the age of 50 without any pre-existing conditions\" who would now have to wait until May."

      "text": "The NHS in England was ill-prepared for the seismic shock of the Covid pandemic, a hospital chief has said.\nThe service was already running at nearly full capacity with long waits for non-urgent operations even before coronavirus arrived, according to Prof Marcel Levi, the University College London Hospitals trust's chief executive.\nProf Levi leaves his role at the end of March, after four years, to return to his native Holland to become chief scientific adviser to the Dutch government.\nIn a BBC interview, he argues that it could take \"a very long time\" to clear the backlog of routine surgery and procedures which has built up because of cancellations during the pandemic. He says more money will be needed quickly to run weekend and evening sessions in operating theatres.\nProf Levi also believes the most successful responses to the pandemic were those under the control of the NHS - in contrast to those which were run by independent contractors. \n\"If you want to get something done, ask the NHS and don't outsource it to all these private companies,\" he said.\nProf Levi started his job in London having been chairman of the executive board of the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam.  \nA magazine in the Netherlands named him as Dutchman of the year in 2016. He is a practising consultant, and continued seeing patients as well as carrying out his chief executive role.\nHe believes hospitals coped extremely well in the face of intense pressure when infection rates surged during the second wave in early 2021.\n\"I do not think there is any country with such a high number of Covid patients presenting with such a steep rise like we've seen in January and February, that were dealt with in any health system in such a proper way,\" he said. \n\"So I'm very proud of how the NHS behaved and acted with the skill available to provide sufficient hospital care for what patients needed.\"\nHowever, the first wave was a very different story. He says the NHS was not as robust as it should have been, a key factor being that the UK was one of the countries with the lowest number of intensive care beds per 1,000 of population. \n\"You cannot run a healthcare system at the capacity we run the NHS. We are always 95% full, so it's impossible to quickly respond to an emergency situation.\"\nEvery winter with influenza circulating there are peaks in demand, resulting in cancellations of operations because there is not enough intensive care space.\n\"We should have seen that and said this is just flu, what would happen if we had a real pandemic - and then we would probably have been better prepared.\"\nThe same argument applies to routine surgery and procedures: there were already long waiting lists even before the pandemic started.  \nMore than 300,000 patients have waited more than a year in England, but Prof Levi points out they had waited a long time before Covid forced hospitals to postpone operations.\n\"Covid is actually a magnifying glass, making it clear that capacity in the NHS is not sufficient - that has now become very obvious. It's going to take, I am afraid, a very long time to get where we want to be.\"\nProf Levi's comments came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced \u00a36.6 billion extra for health and care in England in the first half of the 2021/22 financial year.  \nMr Hancock told MPs the money was in addition to funding committed as part of the spending review to help the NHS meet additional Covid costs and starting work on the elective recovery.\nProf Levi's analysis makes sobering reading, because he has experience of other health systems, and has seen the front line in the UK with a fresh perspective.  \nBut he also believes that the NHS has many strengths - and takes a swipe at the use of private contractors in some areas of the Covid response.\n\"Everything that has been a big success - addressing these massive peaks for patients needing intensive care and also vaccination - was the part done by the NHS. \n\"Everything that was actually not so successful - test-and-trace, PPE provision, all these things - was outsourced to companies which failed to deliver what they promised. \n\"That is a reminder for the future - the NHS is a very strong organisation. If you want to get something done ask the NHS and not outsource it to all these private companies.\"\nAnd the best thing about the NHS? The people who work in it, he said.\n\"The resilience and the quality and the camaraderie of people I have been working with -  doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, cleaners, teamwork - that's something I have never encountered before.\""

      "text": "Tokyo Olympics' creative chief has resigned after suggesting that a female comedian could appear as an \"Olympig\", in the latest setback for the Games.\nHiroshi Sasaki said plus-size entertainer Naomi Watanabe could wear pig ears at the opening ceremony.\nHe later apologised and admitted his remarks were \"a huge insult\" to her. Ms Watanabe has yet to respond.\nThe incident comes after ex-Games president Yoshiro Mori was forced to quit for making sexist remarks.\n\"There was a very inappropriate expression in my ideas and remarks,\" Mr Sasaki said in a statement released through the Games organising committee. \"I sincerely apologise to her and people who have felt discomfort with such content.\"\nMs Watanabe, 33, is one of Japan's most famous comedians, and is known for her celebrity impersonations and body positivity advocacy work.\nIn recent years she has spearheaded a body positive movement called \"pochakawaii\", which translates to \"chubby and cute\", and in 2014 she started one of Japan's first brands to offer plus-size clothing.\nMr Sasaki, 66, who is in charge of the Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, had made the suggestions involving Watanabe last year via a group chat on messaging app Line. The proposal was immediately rejected by his colleagues, who told him it was inappropriate.\nHis resignation came shortly after weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported his remarks on Wednesday. \nOrganisers have said that current Games president Seiko Hashimoto plans to address the matter at a news conference on Thursday. \nFormer Olympian and Japan's ex-Olympics minister Ms Hashimoto was appointed Games president last month after Mr Mori sparked backlash when he said that women talk too much. He also said that meetings with many female board directors would \"take a lot of time\".\nSince taking on the role, Ms Hashimoto has pledged to make gender equality a top priority at the Games, adding 12 female directors to the organising committee's executive board.

      "text": "A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the indecent assault and murder of Stuart Lubbock at the home of Michael Barrymore.\nMr Lubbock, 31, died in hospital after being found unconscious in the TV presenter's pool in Roydon, Essex.\nHe had been attending a party at the home of Mr Barrymore, 68, with eight other people in March 2001.\nThe man, who was arrested in Cheshire, has since been released on bail, Essex Police said.\nA post-mortem examination found Mr Lubbock had suffered \"horrific\" injuries prior to his death, police said. \nAlcohol, ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream.\nDet Supt Lucy Morris, Essex Police's head of major crime, said the arrest was made after \"significant new information\" came to light following a renewed appeal in February 2020. \n\"This information has led to us making an arrest and over the coming days we will be contacting all those who were present at the party at the time as well as others who may have information,\" she said. \n\"As we stated last February and have continually stated over the last 20 years, we believe someone or some people at that party know what happened.\"\nDet Supt Morris said the investigation had been \"extremely lengthy and complex\", adding: \"We have never given up on finding out what exactly happened to Stuart and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends.\"\nMr Lubbock, a butcher from Harlow, was described by neighbours at the time of his death as a \"pleasant, sociable\" man.\nNo-one has ever been charged with any offence in relation to his death. \nReacting to news of the arrest, Mr Lubbock's father Terry said: \"There is just so much going on in my head. I can't get my head around it. \n\"Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me.\"\nIn February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\"All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,\" he said.\nMr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge.\nThe TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death.\nSpeaking last year, he said: \"I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media.\"\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest.\nAn inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict. \nThree years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest.\nIn 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later.\nLast year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
